Which car would contribute to less cleaner atmosphere, car A or car B? John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, car B would contribute to a less cleaner atmosphere. This is because car B is older and does not have a catalytic converter, which is responsible for converting harmful gases into less harmful substances, helping to create a cleaner atmosphere.

Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day Bedouin weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same country. it must be mentioned that what some people today call \\"Bedouin\\" wedding is in fact the original true traditional Arab Islamic wedding without foreign influence. The marriage process usually starts with meetings between the couple's families, and ends with the wedding's consummation (leilat al-dokhla). In Old Palestine, the henna night was a night used to prepare all the necessary wedding decorations and last minute arrangements. It was also a chance for the families to celebrate together before the wedding. The groom's family would sahij or dance through the streets of the village until reaching the house of the bride. Once there, the family would mix henna together, which would then be used to decorate the bride and grooms hands (with the groom's being merely the initials of his bride and himself), and then offer the bride her mahr (usually gold as it does not decline in value like other wealth). The families would then dance and sing traditional Palestinian music. In modern times, particularly those not living in Palestine, the henna night remains traditional in customs, but is very similar to a bachelorette party; the bride's female friends and relatives join her in celebrating, which includes food, drinks, and a lot of dancing. A women's group plays Arabic music, sometimes Islamic music, while everyone dances. A woman draws henna or mehndi, a temporary form of skin decoration using henna, on the bride and guests' skin -- usually the palms and feet, where the henna color will be darkest because the skin contains higher levels of keratin there, which binds temporarily to lawsone, the colorant of henna. The men will also have a party, in which the groom's family and friends will dance to traditional Palestinian music. In some village customs, the groom's face is shaven by a close family member or friend in preparation for his wedding. The tradition of giving the bride her gold is also still used. The groom will enter where the bride is, they well both get their henna done, and the groom will then offer the bride her mahr. Thus, the wedding being merely dancing and celebration. An important element of the henna night in both traditional and non-traditional henna parties, is the dress adorned by the Palestinian women and the groom. The women dress in traditional (usually hand embroidered) gowns, known as Palestinian ithyab. The brides thobe would be extravagant and exquistely embroidered. The groom will wear the usual traditional Arab men's thobe and hata (head covering). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are the couple allowed to see each other on henna night ?","response":"Yes, the couple is allowed to see each other on the henna night. During this celebration, the groom will enter where the bride is, and they both get their henna done together. After that, the groom will offer the bride her mahr (gift).

One suitable task could be designing a simple machine like a lever or pulley system to lift a heavy object. Here's a step-by-step process and justification for creating a lever system: 1. Understand the problem: The objective is to lift a heavy object, so we want to apply the physical principle of leverage to create a mechanical advantage without exerting too much force. 2. Identify the type of lever: There are three types of levers - first-class, second-class, and third-class. Since we want to lift a heavy object with minimal effort, a first-class lever is suitable, as it has the fulcrum (support point) between the effort point and the load point. 3. Determine the length of the lever: The longer the lever, the more mechanical advantage it provides. By applying the principle of leverage (i.e., longer levers require less force to move an object), we can calculate the appropriate length of the lever based on the weight of the object and the desired amount of force we want to apply. 4. Position the fulcrum: To create the best mechanical advantage, place the fulcrum closer to the heavy object (the load). This arrangement requires less force to lift the object. 5. Choose the appropriate materials: Select a strong and sturdy material for the lever, such as metal or wood, ensuring it can withstand the forces involved without bending or breaking. 6. Test the lever: Place the heavy object on one end of the lever and apply force to the other end (the effort point). Observe if the lever is able to lift the object without too much physical exertion. This task involves physical reasoning, as the person performing it needs to understand the properties of levers, the forces involved, and how to manipulate these variables to create an efficient and effective solution to lift a heavy object."},{"question":"Information: - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London.

The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta. - Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetrical state ends up in an asymmetrical state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. - The Sapienza University of Rome, (Italian: Sapienza Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the \\"University of Rome\\", is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. Formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\", it is the largest European university by enrollments (the third if considering also the distance learning schools) and one of the oldest in history, founded in 1303. The University is also the most prestigious Italian university and also the best ranked in Southern Europe. - In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a system crossing a critical point decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or \\"noise\\"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called symmetry \\"breaking\\", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is supposed to play a major role in pattern formation. - In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature). - Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe, also known as Mediterranean Europe, include the countries of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the Italian peninsula, Southern France, Greece and Malta. Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of Southeast Europe, which are geographically technically in the southern part of Europe, but which have different historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds that commonly places them in the category of Eastern Europe. - Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics. - The Accademia dei Lincei (literally the \\"Academy of the Lynx-Eyed\\", but anglicised as the Lincean Academy) is an Italian science academy, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy. - In physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves \\"as if\\" it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it \\"approximately\\" behaves like an electron with a \\"different mass\\" (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \\"electron\\" with a different mass is called an \\"electron quasiparticle\\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others. - Giovanni Jona - Lasinio ( born 1932 ) , sometimes called Gianni Jona , is an Italian theoretical physicist , best known for his works on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics .

Mike Culligan Answer:","response":"Title: The Legacy of Culligan's Treasure Plot: The movie opens in the bustling, picturesque town of Hartsville where everyone knows everyone else. The economic prosperity of this vibrant community is all thanks to Mike Culligan, the richest man in town, credited with saving the town from financial ruin three decades ago. Culligan Industries, his multinational conglomerate, employs a majority of the townspeople, providing stable jobs and benefits. The well-respected Mike Culligan is living his last days due to a terminal illness. Rumors circulate around town that he has amassed a fortune in gold and precious stones over the years, leaving a treasure hidden somewhere in Hartsville. This news incites excitement, curiosity, and greed among the townspeople, leading to a treasure hunt. Among the treasure seekers is Sarah Thompson, a struggling single mother working for Culligan Industries, who dreams of providing a better life for her son, Timmy. Sarah, disheartened by her challenging life, sees the treasure as a means to break free from her financial insecurities. As the race to find the treasure begins, we follow the adventures of three groups. The first, consisting of Sarah, her son Timmy, and her father, George – an ex-jeweler with knowledge of the town's history. The second is a band of conmen from out-of-town, led by the cunning and ruthless Victor Mathers. The third group comprises two underdogs from the local pub, Jim and Andy, who aspire to turn their lives around. Across the town and its outskirts, various experiences, encounters, and clues lead our groups into a whirlwind of unexpected events and discoveries. From deciphering cryptic messages hidden in Mike Culligan's old letters to navigating through secret chambers at Culligan's mansion, Sarah, the conmen, and the underdogs converge on an old abandoned factory on the outskirts of Hartsville. In the factory's underground chambers, they find the treasure, only to be caught by Victor and his men. A thrilling confrontation ensues, forcing everyone to fight against the conmen. In the end, Sarah’s group, with the help of Jim and Andy, outsmarts Victor and his gang, who are then arrested by the police. The movie then cuts to Mike Culligan, who had been observing the events unfold from his home via hidden cameras. The treasure was, in fact, a test to unite the people of Hartsville and identify those with a strong sense of morality and loyalty. Mike Culligan bequeaths his entire industrial empire to Sarah, Jim, and Andy, as a token of gratitude for their integrity and perseverance. He passes away peacefully, knowing that the future of the town is in good hands. The movie ends with Sarah, now the majority shareholder of Culligan Industries, promising to uphold the values and commitment of Mike Culligan, ensuring that his legacy lives on while ensuring a bright and thriving future for Hartsville."},{"question":"Sentence: The AIDAluna has a length of 252000.0 millimetres and had its maiden voyage on March 22, 2009.

Japan. Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport. Every four years, nearly every country in the world tlghts for the World Cup. Tens of billions of soccer fans from around the world watch the World Cup on television.

One such realm that often flies under the radar is ventriloquism, a fascinating facet of live entertainment. The passion, artistry, and dedication required by the ventriloquists are explored in the documentary \\"Dumbstruck,\\" now available for streaming on the world-renowned American media platform, washingtonpost.com. \\"Dumbstruck\\" is a moving exploration of a unique corner of the entertainment universe, captured brilliantly and presented to viewers with mesmerizing intimacy. The documentary builds its formidability through a variety of nuanced steps. Director Mark Goffman commences the tale not with an abstract view, but with personalized accounts of five professional and aspirational ventriloquists. This approach caters to the documentary's essence of humanity, turning the spotlight on the life of individual artists rather than the art form itself. To write a critique of 'Dumbstruck,' it is important to appreciate this human-centric approach and empathize with the struggles and triumphs of the cast. The next step to understanding the reality of the documentary is recognizing the amount of work that goes into bringing it to life. Venturing beyond regular film sets, \\"Dumbstruck\\" takes viewers on a behind-the-scenes journey to the Vent Haven ConVENTion in Kentucky. The documentary authentically captures this event, with meticulous editing ensuring that the atmosphere of the convention is present in every frame. Goffman embraces the authenticity of the journey, never shying away from portraying the real challenges faced by ventriloquists. Be it Kim Yeager's struggle to gain her family's approval, Dan Horn's traversal through changing industry trends, or Terry Fator's thrilling Vegas victory, \\"Dumbstruck\\" paints a vivid picture of their lives and struggles. In evaluating the overall quality of \\"Dumbstruck,\\" it'd be remiss not to mention the incredible aesthetic quality of the documentary. Clever camera work and editing contribute to enforcing the documentary's narrative and enhancing its visual appeal. The use of light and shadow, the insightful close-ups, and the creatively composed shots collectively add depth to the story being told. The documentary is not without its minor flaws, however. While enhancing a viewer's understanding of the ventriloquism industry, the documentary lacks a comprehensive contextual backdrop, limiting those who are new to this facet of entertainment. On a concluding note, \\"Dumbstruck\\" on washingtonpost.com offers fascinating insight into a lesser-known facet of the entertainment realm. It brings to the fore the persuasive power of storytelling, interweaving personal strife and dreams that should resonate deeply with audiences old and new to ventriloquism. In the grand scheme of artistic and enthusing documentaries, the Washington Post has once again housed a standout piece, being \\"Dumbstruck.\\" Its ability to spark curiosity, inspire, and appreciate an oft-overlooked art form stands testimonial to the documentary's comprehensive success. This critic review aims to elevate and appreciate the vision, effort, and execution poured into this captivating tale of puppeteers and their intriguing world. One cannot help but laud the commendable effort and recommend it for an educated, enlightening watch."},{"question":"Read the given text and if it has abusive content then indicate via \\"yes\\". Otherwise indicate via\\"no\\". We consider the content to be abusive if it contains any of the following instances: (1) Identity Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which contains a negative statement made against an identity. An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation) (2) Affiliation Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors).) (3) Person Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language.) and (4) Counter Speech (e.g., Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others.). Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Q: Here's where I think the distinction lies - I may be wrong, and call me out if you want, but here goes: So, believe all victims is a good and noble idea at a basic level. When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons. This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation. With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play. When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim. The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it: His claims had a major effect to divide the country. Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story. When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding. In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

OPT: * negative * positive","response":"To determine the sentiment of the tweet, let's break down the tweet step-by-step and analyze the key aspects. Step 1: Identify the subject Subject: Writing a report on \\"the Tundra\\" Step 2: Identify potential use of sarcasm The phrase \\"How interesting!\\" might be sarcastic considering the subject of the tweet is about writing a report on the Tundra, which may not be inherently exciting to everyone. Step 3: Identify any context that could affect the sentiment There is no context given in the tweet that would clearly affect the sentiment, so it's ambiguous whether the user meant \\"How interesting!\\" positively or sarcastically. Step 4: Assess overall sentiment based on the information available Since it's unclear if \\"How interesting!\\" is meant to be sarcastic or genuine, the sentiment of the tweet is uncertain. We may need a broader context to make a more accurate assessment. However, as we need to choose between negative and positive, the usage of the exclamation mark with \\"How interesting!\\" could be an indication of genuine enthusiasm, so an argument can be made for: * positive"},{"question":"- Carbon dioxide passes through stomata in the leaves - Water is absorbed through roots - Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll - Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight - Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen gets released into atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose What might be the last step of the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"The last step in the process of photosynthesis is the formation of glucose and other organic compounds, which serve as energy storage and building materials for the plant. After the hydrogen and carbon dioxide have been used to create glucose through a series of chemical reactions, the final step is known as the Calvin Cycle. In this cycle, a series of enzymes and other compounds within the chloroplasts facilitate the conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen into glucose and other sugars, as well as amino acids and other vital cellular components. The Calvin Cycle consists of three main stages: carbon fixation, reduction, and regeneration. During carbon fixation, the enzyme RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) incorporates carbon dioxide into an organic molecule, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This results in the formation of an unstable 6-carbon compound, which quickly breaks down into two 3-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglycerate. In the reduction phase, the 3-phosphoglycerate molecules are converted into molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) using energy from ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and reducing power from NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), both of which were generated during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. G3P is a sugar molecule that can be readily converted into glucose and other sugars, fats, or amino acids. Finally, during the regeneration stage, the remaining G3P molecules are used to regenerate RuBP, allowing the cycle to continue. This process requires additional energy from ATP. Out of every six G3P molecules produced by the Calvin Cycle, five are used to regenerate RuBP and only one is used to synthesize glucose or other organic compounds. By using the energy harvested from sunlight, plants are able to produce glucose and other essential compounds needed for growth, reproduction, and overall cellular function. This process enables them to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen as a byproduct, playing a critical role in Earth's carbon cycle and supporting life on our planet."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Possible answers: curious to hear Bailey´s response, nosey, inquisitive","response":"To determine the most appropriate description for Sasha, we must consider their role and context of the situation. In this scenario, Sasha is a teacher in a school. Step 1: Analyze the role of Sasha Sasha is a teacher; their primary responsibility is to teach and guide students toward understanding the subject matter. An essential aspect of teaching is engaging students by asking questions to gauge students' comprehension and encourage active participation. Step 2: Evaluate the context of the question Sasha asked a question in the context of a school setting where it's expected for teachers to seek student input. This act demonstrates that Sasha wants their students, including Bailey, to think critically and provide input. Step 3: Evaluate possible answers and choose the most fitting 1. Curious to hear Bailey's response: This description could imply that Sasha is simply interested in Bailey's answer, which is natural for a teacher when asking a question. 2. Nosey: This description suggests Sasha is overly interested in Bailey's personal affairs, which seems misplaced, as the context is a school setting where asking questions is a part of the teaching process. 3. Inquisitive: This description focuses on Sasha's eagerness for understanding and information, which can be true for a teacher trying to assess student comprehension. Based on the analysis of the role and context, it seems \\"curious to hear Bailey's response\\" and \\"inquisitive\\" are both appropriate descriptions. \\"Inquisitive\\" can better emphasize Sasha's general desire for knowledge and understanding as a teacher, whereas \\"curious to hear Bailey's response\\" emphasizes Sasha's interest in a specific student's input.

According to Newton's second law, force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). In this scenario, both horses apply the same force (since they are equally strong), but horse 1 has to move a greater mass (extra 10 pounds of food). Therefore, to maintain the equation equivalent, with a higher mass, the acceleration must be lower for horse 1.

This is the astonishing moment holidaymakers watched wild dolphins put on a show for them just yards away from a Cornish beach. Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming. Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving last Friday. Mrs Drabble, of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, said: ‘It was a breathtaking experience - I was actually crying at what I saw. 'Everyone on the beach was cheering as they jumped out of the water. I think the dolphins were showing off for everyone.’ Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to 21C (70F) over the weekend. Mrs Drabble said lifeguards eventually managed to encourage the dolphins away from swimmers, with the help of a helicopter. Scroll down for video. Impressive: Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming on Friday. Watching: Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving beneath the waves. Hot weather: Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to the 21C over the weekend. ¿Breathtaking¿: People on the beach in Cornwall were said to have been cheering as the dolphins jumped out of the water. Time to leave: Lifeguards urged people to stay away from the dolphins, before a helicopter was used to encourage them to swim back out into open water. Some 28 species of cetacean have been recorded in UK waters, with 11 of these regularly appearing, according to Government figures. Dolphins can be viewed from places such as Chanonry Point in the Moray Firth near Inverness, as well as Cardigan Bay in Wales. They can also be seen around Land's End in Cornwall from January to April, as well as on the east coast of Scotland between July and September. It is illegal under British law to intentionally kill or injure a dolphin, or ‘recklessly disturb’ one - for example to cause it distress by chasing it in a boat. Fishermen with larger vessels are obliged to fit acoustic deterrent devices to deter dolphins from approaching them, and reducing by-catch levels. They are also advised to reel in their lines if dolphins appear while fishing, before moving away from an area if the cetaceans do not leave first. Dolphins are powerful animals that can become aggressive towards humans, and it can be harmful for both parties if people attempt feeding. Two decades ago US officials had to issue guidance on this subject after people were seen in Florida feeding dolphins beer, hot dogs and sweets. It is recommended that people get no closer than 50 yards to dolphins, because they can feel harassed if you get too close to them. In addition, dolphins have delicate skin which is very sensitive to human touch and therefore can be at risk of harm from humans. Warmer sees could be behind a rise for a change in the type of dolphins spotted off the North East, a survey suggested four years ago. A rise in sightings of common, bottlenose and Risso's dolphins - associated with warmer waters - was reported by the North East Cetacean Project. Among the cetaceans whose numbers sighted off the UK have increased over the past 30 years are the common dolphin and striped dolphin.","response":"1.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","response":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Because in came Aunt Norris Fanny stopped talking\\" can be analyzed on several levels, including its grammatical construction, syntactic coherence, and semantic clarity. We can also assess the sentence's effectiveness in conveying the desired meaning and its adherence to standard English conventions. 1. Grammatical Construction: Grammatically, the sentence contains two clauses—\\"Because in came Aunt Norris\\" and \\"Fanny stopped talking.\\" However, proper conjunction usage and punctuation are missing, making the sentence seem fragmented and difficult to comprehend. 2. Syntactic Coherence: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence. In this sentence, the word order is somewhat unconventional and might confuse readers. A more syntactically coherent version could be: \\"Fanny stopped talking because Aunt Norris came in.\\" 3. Semantic Clarity: Semantically, the sentence relies on context for clarity. For those unfamiliar with the characters or story, the significance of Aunt Norris entering the room and Fanny stopping talking may not be apparent. Nonetheless, it is clear that Fanny's action (stopping talking) is a result of Aunt Norris's arrival. 4. Conveying Meaning: Despite its grammatical and syntactic issues, the sentence manages to convey the core message—that Fanny stopped talking due to Aunt Norris's entrance. However, it may require a second reading for some readers to fully grasp the intended meaning. 5. Adherence to Standard English Conventions: The sentence does not strictly adhere to standard English conventions. Some rearrangements in word order, proper punctuation, and conjunction usage would improve its readability and clarity, such as: \\"Fanny stopped talking because Aunt Norris came in,\\" or \\"Because Aunt Norris came in, Fanny stopped talking.\\" In conclusion, while the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Because in came Aunt Norris Fanny stopped talking\\" falls short in some areas, particularly grammatical construction and syntactic coherence, it can still communicate the main idea. To enhance its linguistic integrity, revising the sentence to align more with standard English conventions is advisable. The revised version would be more accessible to readers and convey the intended meaning more effectively."},{"question":"Given the question: Title: Portable stand Review: I bought 2 stands for our ipads and we love them.

He had been playing backup quarterback for about a month in the 2015 season when he was asked to walk in the show. It was for a good cause and so the man whose career had been put into jeopardy by infighting between a coach and a team owner put on the stylish clothes he was given, gave the crowd his biggest smile and strutted up and down the runway. His wife walked as well. By then, it was long apparent his career in Washington was over but as Kiersten Allen, the wife of Redskins president Bruce Allen, told me at the time, he had never blinked about doing the show. “He embraces the organization, the charitable foundation every chance he gets,” she said at the time. “He’s a great player.” On Tuesday, Bruce Allen confirmed what we had all known for a long time. Griffin’s time in Washington is done (after all they would have to pay a hefty sum to keep him even as a backup) and they wish him nothing but the best. Griffin is entering a free agent market that includes a handful of quarterbacks whose career hasn’t panned out exactly as planned, and while there are a number of wavering opinions about where he goes, watching him walk away from the team that marketed him as their future it’s hard not to root for him to find a fit somewhere. As Chris Chase wrote earlier this year, Griffin was the MVP of the Redskins’ surprisingly successful 2015 campaign — he never publicly undercut his replacement, he remained professional and when he cleaned out his locker for what he knew would be a final time left only a poster with this message: “Forgive them anyway. Be kind anyway. Succeed anyway. Create anyway. Be happy anyway. Do good anyway. Give your best anyway. It was never between you and them anyway.” Football is a business and Griffin isn’t the only player to have found himself in a place at the wrong time or to have injuries dampen what was supposed to be a brilliant career. So as he walks away from Washington, here’s to hoping he finds himself in a much better place in 2016. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Robert Griffin III, a quarterback whose career was jeopardized by infighting between his coach and team owner, is entering the free agent market and hoping to find a better fit elsewhere after leaving the Washington Redskins.

The growing field of \\"music treatment\\" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state.

In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym?

Forks at that time were fairly large with two tines that aided in the cutting of meat in the kitchen. The tines prevented meat from twisting or moving during cutting and allowed food to slide off more easily than it would with a knife. By the 7th century A.D., royal courts of the Middle East began to use forks at the table for dining. From the 10th through the 13th centuries, forks were fairly common among the wealthy in Byzantium. In the 11th century, a Byzantine wife brought forks to Italy; however, they were not widely adopted there until the 16th century. Then in 1533, forks were brought from Italy to France. The French were also slow to accept forks, for using them was thought to be awkward. In 1608, forks were brought to England by Thomas Coryate, who saw them during his travels in Italy. The English first ridiculed forks as being unnecessary. \\"Why should a person need a fork when God had given him hands?\\" they asked. Slowly, however, forks came to be adopted by the wealthy as a symbol of their social status. They were prized possessions made of expensive materials intended to impress guests. By the mid 1600s, eating with forks was considered fashionable among the wealthy British. Early table forks were modeled after kitchen forks, but small pieces of food often fell through the two tines or slipped off easily. In late 17th century France, larger forks with four curved tines were developed. The additional tines made diners less likely to drop food, and the curved tines served as a scoop so people did not have to constantly switch to a spoon while eating. By the early 19th century, four-tined forks had also been developed in Germany and England and slowly began to spread to America. In which way did the use of forks spread?

Marie Curie's groundbreaking work in the fields of radioactivity, chemistry, and physics earned her this distinct honor, making her one of the most celebrated scientists in history. In 1903, Marie Curie received her first Nobel Prize in Physics alongside her husband Pierre Curie and French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel. The trio was recognized for their pioneering work on radioactivity, a term Marie Curie had coined to describe the phenomenon they discovered. Marie and Pierre Curie's research had focused on the study of uranium and thorium radiation, which led them to discover and isolate two new radioactive elements: polonium (named after Marie Curie's country of origin, Poland) and radium. Her second Nobel Prize came in 1911, this time in Chemistry, and was awarded to her solely for her continued outstanding work in radioactivity. The prize was a result of her groundbreaking research, particularly her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, as well as the isolation of radium in the form of radium chloride - a feat that required years of laborious work to extract the minute quantities of the substance from large amounts of pitchblende ore. Additionally, her determination of radium's atomic weight and her studies on the properties and compounds of the radioactive elements significantly contributed to the development of the field. Marie Curie's work has had a profound and lasting impact on various disciplines such as medical research, atomic physics, and nuclear technology. She laid the foundation for the understanding of radioactivity and its applications, including its use in cancer treatment through radiation therapy. She also established the first military radiology centers during World War I, providing mobile X-ray units, collectively referred to as \\"Little Curies,\\" for the treatment of injured soldiers. Sadly, her exposure to radioactivity throughout her career took a toll on her health. Marie Curie passed away at the age of 66 on July 4, 1934, due to complications arising from prolonged exposure to radioactive materials. She was not aware of the potential hazards of radiation during her time, and the harmful effects it had on her well-being. Marie Curie's legacy lives on as a testament to her trailblazing work in science. Her groundbreaking discoveries—the development of radioactivity theory, the discovery and isolation of polonium and radium, and the practical applications of radioactive compounds—have significantly impacted modern science, medicine, and technology. A trailblazer in her time, Marie Curie broke barriers for women in the scientific community, proving that perseverance, determination, and courage can pave the way for extraordinary achievements."},{"question":"How does the next paragraph end?

Under 100 words is a good title length. Q: The CyP40 protein encoded by PPID gene is a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family. PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate the folding of proteins. The CyP40 protein has been shown to possess PPIase activity and, similar to other family members, can bind to the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA). In this study, we created keratinocyte cell lines with CyP40 being stably knocked down using viral particles containing shRNA for CyP40 which knocked down the expression level of CyP40 transcripts by 90 to 99%. The proliferation rates of the cell lines with silenced CyP40 were decreased compared to the control cells. After UVA irradiation, the rate of apoptosis was found to be significantly lower in CyP40 silenced cell lines than it was in control cells. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was found to be less dissipated and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) less active in cells with knocked down CyP40 than in control cells after UVA irradiation. Also, less mitochondrial superoxide was detected in the cells with silenced CyP40 compared to control cells after UVA exposure. Moreover, silencing of CyP40 partially modulates expression of key genes involved in mitochondrial pore formation including CyPD, ANTs and VDAC family members. The ability of CyP40 to regulate UV induced apoptosis implicates this protein as a potential target for therapy in cancer cells.

Born on April 2, 1827, in Cheapside, London, he was renowned as one of the founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which was a group of artists that formed in 1848, along with John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The Pre-Raphaelite movement sought to return to the artistic principles and styles before the High Renaissance, emphasizing naturalism, vivid colors, and attention to detail. \\"The Light of the World\\" (1853-54) is one of William Holman Hunt's most famous paintings, featuring a striking image of Jesus Christ dressed in a long white robe, holding a lantern in one hand, and knocking on a door that is covered in weeds and overgrowth. The painting is based on the biblical passage from the Book of Revelation, chapter 3, verse 20: \\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\\" The painting, which currently resides in Keble College, Oxford, stunningly illustrates Christ as a gentle savior offering spiritual comfort and guidance to the viewer. Another notable painting of William Holman Hunt is \\"The Scapegoat\\" (1854-56). This piece visually represents the Jewish religious ritual described in the Book of Leviticus, where a goat would be sent into the wilderness to \\"bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited.\\" The concept of the scapegoat is used symbolically in various other instances throughout history and literature, representing the idea of one individual taking on the blame and guilt of others. In \\"The Scapegoat,\\" the solitary animal is depicted standing on a desolate and unreceptive landscape near the Dead Sea, illustrating its symbolic exile as it carries the sins of the community. The vivid colors and astounding level of detail in both the goat and the surrounding environment are characteristic of Hunt's commitment to the Pre-Raphaelite movement's principles. Throughout his extended career, Hunt traveled frequently, moving between England and the Middle East. He sought to capture authentic settings and details in his art, driven by a relentless dedication to truth and accuracy. While his works are deeply rooted in religious themes, the Pre-Raphaelite vision that shone through vividly portrayed a naturalism and vibrancy that set them apart from their contemporaries. William Holman Hunt passed away on September 7, 1910, leaving behind not only these two iconic paintings but a rich and meaningful portfolio that has inspired and captivated art enthusiasts from around the world."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland.

Outside of his extensive hardware collection, Phelps has helped Under Armour and agency Droga5 hit some major milestones with his \\"Rule Yourself\\" ad, including a Film Craft Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions festival. Now it's become one of the most shared Olympics spots ever. New data from Unruly shows the Phelps Under Armour spot is now the second most shared Olympics ad for 2016—behind Channel 4's incredible Paralympics spot \\"We're The Superhumans,\\"—and the fifth most shared Olympics spot of all time. What makes the ad, created by Droga5, so sharable? For one, it's striking the right emotional chord with its target audience: millennial men between the ages of 18 and 34. The dramatic nature of the Phelps spot (with a killer track from The Kills) and its ability to take viewers through the swimmer's intense training process elicited a sense of inspiration among 47 percent of overall viewers, and 68 percent of millennial men. Twenty-two percent of viewers reported feeling amazement watching the athlete training and even undergoing some extraordinarily painful-looking sessions of cupping therapy. Millennials also felt happiness and surprise—all key emotions needed to engage younger viewers, according to Unruly. \\"Something we've learned from all of the ads we tested if we look at different demographics and the emotions that are most resonant to them, for millennials—especially male millennials—inspiration is one of the top emotions. If that is present at all in an ad, they tend to experience it,\\" Devra Prywes, VP, marketing and insight at Unruly, said. Prywes noted that the inspiration factor seemed to be lacking in a lot of Super Bowl spots from this year but stands out in many Olympics spots, which is likely helping to propel shares for the Olympic ads. To date, 56 percent of the spots' shares are coming from Facebook, followed by Twitter at 28 percent. Prywes contended that Under Armour has successfully been able to consistently create authentic spots, with stars from Misty Copeland to the U.S. Women's Gymnastics team. Each piece of work continues to inspire and amaze audiences while also building a sense of pride in viewers, according to the data. Droga5 co-head of strategy Harry Roman echoed Prywes, adding that the Phelps ad is so shareable because it's able to convey the sacrifice that the swimmer makes each day to prepare for Rio. \\"I think people connect with this film because it paints hard work and sacrifice with beautiful strokes, but does so in a way that is raw and real about what it takes to win. I would like to think that this film and the stirring lyrics, 'It's The Last Goodbye,' are playing in the back of people's minds when they see him smiling on the podium. We probably won't ever see another athlete like Michael Phelps for a very long time,\\" Roman said.

Who is this man,and why is he so important that he is featured on the back of a coin? The man on this quarter is John Muir.Even as a child, Muir loved watching nature. As a young man,he spent much of his life exploring the beauty of the wilderness.He walked more than a thousand miles across the country,through fields and woods.John Muir liked writing about the places he visited,describing their beauty. Muir also wrote about problems.In order to create more farmland for sheep and cattle, rnany trees were being cut down.This made Muir unhappy and worried,because he knew that trees were important to forests and to the animals that lived in them.Muir believed that nature should be conserved instead of being changed by human beings.He wrote articles in magazines and newspapers to spread the word about conserving forests.Soon,others began to listen. Muir wrote letters to important people,such as President Theodore Roosevelt.The president admired Muir's love for nature.When Roosevelt came to visit Muir in California. Muir convinced the president to go camping with him for three nights under the trees so they could talk about conservation.Later,President Roosevelt set aside 148 million acres of land for national forests and established five national parks.National parks are large areas of land that are protected from development. This means that people cannot build homes or businesses there. One of these parks is Yosemite National Park,the area that is featured on the back of the California quarter. Though it has been almost one hundred years since John Muir died,people continue his work today.His work as a conservationist helped us to see the beauty of our natural world.John Muir made us understand the importance of protecting our earth and our resources---then,now,and for the future.

The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources, most notably gold. Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned, and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language; latin. The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps (castra) as Aquis Querquennis, Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti (Lugo), roads (viae) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules, in Corunna, but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of Romanization.

An estimated 100,000 Scottish Presbyterians moved to the northern counties of Ireland between 1607 and the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.[citation needed] The Presbytery of Ulster was formed in 1642 separately from the established Anglican Church.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

However, in this ever-changing industry, maintaining one's image and reputation is of utmost importance. To this end, Cruise has decided to bring in a professional Hollywood insider to manage his publicity, replacing his sister, Lee Anne DeVette. Lee Anne DeVette had been the source of Cruise's thriving public image for many years, as she diligently worked behind the scenes to steer her brother's career in the right direction. Cruise had been relying on family support to maintain his public persona, but with the growing complexities of the Hollywood landscape and Tom Cruise's increasing stardom, it became evident that a change was necessary. DeVette's time managing Cruise's publicity saw her showcasing her ability to handle the ins and outs of the entertainment business, but as her brother's trajectory continues to skyrocket, Cruise has chosen to place her energy on a different mission. In comes the professional Hollywood insider, a figure skilled at dealing with the intricacies of Tinseltown's fast-paced game. This decision to shift gears and hire a specialist in public relations stems from a need to further elevate Cruise's reputation to a higher level. With countless new projects in the pipeline and increasing visibility across the globe, it is imperative to have an expert at the helm of his publicity. This change will ensure better crisis management, improved interactions with the media, and robust strategies to maximize his reach and allure. Undoubtedly, the choice to replace his sister was not an easy one for Cruise, as he remains devoted to his family. However, the business of Hollywood requires a keen understanding of the various key players and strategic moves, something that professional publicists are trained to navigate with finesse. Cruise's dedication to his craft is mirrored in his investment in a high-profile publicist who will assure that his image remains untarnished and respected. This decision further showcases the value of hiring a competent and seasoned publicist to navigate the often treacherous waters of Hollywood. The role of publicists in managing the image and public perception of their clients is more significant than ever, given the proliferation of social media and intensified scrutiny from the public eye. Cruise's choice to invest in a publicist who is well-connected within the Hollywood network demonstrates foresight and a keen understanding of the importance of an unblemished reputation in the film industry. In conclusion, Tom Cruise's decision to replace his sister with a professional Hollywood insider as his publicist is a strategic move that mirrors the direction of modern Hollywood. As the industry evolves, public relations play a heightened role in the success of celebrities and the upkeep of their image. This change ensures that Cruise's stellar career remains on track, and his relationship with the media continues to promote his image in the best possible light. Only time will tell how this strategic decision will play out in the long run, but as of now, one thing is for sure - Tom Cruise is prepared for bigger challenges ahead, with the support of a powerful Hollywood insider managing his publicity. The actor's fans can look forward to witnessing even more extraordinary achievements from him in the years to come, as he masters the art of captivating the audience with the help of his new professional publicist."},{"question":"In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell.

When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet.

Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer \\"teacher-subject\\" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from \\"15 volts of electricity (slight shock)\\" to \\"450 volts (danger -- severe shock)\\" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed \\"pupil\\" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the \\"pupil\\" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond.

A rock is a commonly found object outdoors, that fits within the human hand, and has the sufficient weight and solidity to eliminate a bug. A. Picking up a tree would be not just practically impossible for a human due to its large size and firmly rooted structure, but also excessive for the task. B. A garden is not something you can 'grab'.

While a rug could theoretically be used to squash a bug, bearing in mind the setting provided i.e., outdoors, it is unlikely you would have a rug to hand.

What American Class I railroad that ran from Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle, Washington, was formerly where Tionesta is today? The answer to this question is:","response":"The Great Northern Railway was the American Class I railroad that ran from Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle, Washington, and it formerly passed through the area where Tionesta is located today. Founded by James J. Hill in the late 19th century, this railway was a significant transportation system for both passengers and freight in the northwestern United States, covering a distance of approximately 1,700 miles. The Great Northern Railway played a crucial role in the development and expansion of the American West and was known for its innovative approach to creating efficient rail infrastructure. The Great Northern Railway was formed in 1889, as the end result of a series of mergers and consolidations of smaller railroads, such as the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway, and the Minneapolis & St. Cloud Railroad. Hill's vision was to create a transcontinental railroad that provided efficient and reliable transportation between the Midwest and the ports of the Pacific Northwest. The route chosen for the Great Northern Railway was a strategic one because it followed the shortest and lowest gradients through the rugged terrain, which would require fewer resources to maintain and ultimately be more cost-effective. The construction of the Great Northern Railway was a significant undertaking, especially when building through the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade Range. To build the railway, laborers, primarily immigrants from various countries, worked tirelessly on difficult terrain, often facing harsh weather conditions, and sometimes rival railroad companies. The completion of the railway in 1893 connected St. Paul, Minnesota, with Seattle, Washington, and provided improved access to the resources of the region, including lumber, coal, and agricultural products. As the Great Northern Railway expanded and found success, towns and cities along its route developed and prospered. Tionesta, now a ghost town, was once a thriving community situated along the railroad in what is now the Colville National Forest in Washington state. Today, Tionesta no longer exists due to the relocation of the railway as well as the construction of the Albeni Falls Dam that flooded the area where the town once stood. During its operation, the Great Northern Railway was known for its distinctive orange and green locomotives and its use of advanced technologies, such as streamliners and diesel-electric locomotives, which provided faster and more efficient transportation. Despite facing economic challenges and competition from other forms of transport throughout the 20th century, the railway continued to operate until it eventually merged with the Northern Pacific Railway and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1970. This merger led to the creation of the Burlington Northern Railroad, which in 1996 joined with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to become the present-day BNSF Railway, one of the largest freight railroad networks in North America."},{"question":"these beliefs form the bedrock of the vision that is ease, an environment that is a living demonstration of this philosophy.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. I am facing a new situation today: Two sisters went to the doctor to get screened for cancer. Lisa had cancer, while her sister Beth didn't. Lisa was terrified, but her sister comforted her.

A:","response":"Based on the information provided, the correct answer to the question is: Lisa's sister, Beth, had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably.

In the new situation, it is stated that Lisa has cancer, which implies that her cells are dividing uncontrollably due to mutations in the genes that control the cell cycle. 3. Beth, on the other hand, does not have cancer. This indicates that her cells are not dividing uncontrollably, meaning there is a lower number of abnormal cells in her body compared to Lisa. 4.

Those accusations forced the resignation on Tuesday of Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, who Ijaz says orchestrated this proposal, which was delivered in a unsigned memo in May to Adm. Mike Mullen, then-U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state that is home to a number of Taliban groups that attack U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan and also is home to what remains of al Qaeda's \\"core\\" organization. Haqqani helped smooth over many tense moments in the important U.S.-Pakistan relationship, including the shooting in January of two Pakistanis by CIA contractor Raymond Davis and the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in northern Pakistan in May. Ijaz has said that the offer to get rid of the leadership of the Pakistani Army was sanctioned by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The story is an explosive one in Pakistan, where relations between the civilian government and the military leadership are often tense and the United States is deeply unpopular. Writing in the Financial Times on October 10, Ijaz explained that, \\"The embarrassment of bin Laden being found on Pakistani soil had humiliated Mr. Zardari's weak civilian government to such an extent that the president feared a military takeover was imminent. He needed an American fist on his army chief's desk to end any misguided notions of a coup -- and fast.\\" Haqqani denies being involved in any such scheme, and Mullen says that while he did receive a memo that made this kind of offer-- delivered to him by Obama's former National Security Adviser James L. Jones -- he ignored it because it just didn't seem credible. According to Ijaz, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, Pakistan's powerful military intelligence chief, recently traveled to London to meet with him, where he \\"forensically tested\\" Ijaz's evidence, which consists of Blackberry messages between Ijaz and Haqqani. While the affair has already brought down Haqqani, a longtime critic of Pakistan's military establishment and a well-known figure in diplomatic and national security circles in Washington, it could also damage the country's civilian government. Haqqani's wife, Farah Ispahani, is President Zardari's spokeswoman and a prominent member of the governing Pakistan People's Party. The man at the center of it all. Who is Mansoor Ijaz, the Pakistani-American businessman at the center of this twisted tale? Born to a family of Pakistani immigrants in Tallahassee, Florida, Ijaz grew up in rural Virginia, the son of two college teachers. After getting an undergraduate degree in nuclear physics from the University of Virginia and an MA in engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the early 1990s Ijaz founded Crescent Investment Management, a New York investment firm. Crescent was politically well-connected. Ijaz's partner in the firm was retired Air Force Lt. General James Alan Abrahamson, who played an instrumental role in President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (\\"Star Wars\\"). Another Washington heavyweight, the former CIA director R. James Woolsey, was chairman of the board of Ijaz's publicly listed company, Crescent Technology Ventures PLC, based in London. In the mid-'90s, Ijaz gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party, and hobnobbed with the Clintons at fund raising events. In 2003, journalist Richard Miniter, in a book titled \\"Losing Bin Laden: How Bill Clinton's Failures Unleashed Global Terror\\", relied on Ijaz as the principal source for the key part of his thesis, which concerned the five years Osama bin Laden spent in Sudan in the early and mid- 1990s. Miniter described multiple attempts Ijaz made between August 1996 and 1998 to interest the Clinton administration in improving relations with Sudan, as well as Sudanese offers to hand over intelligence on al Qaeda. In his account to Miniter and in later writings, Ijaz claimed to have helped draft a proposal for Sudan to provide intelligence on al Qaeda to the Clinton administration, and that Sudan had offered to arrest bin Laden. Clinton administration officials did not take Ijaz up on any of his offers to help because they viewed him as \\"a Walter Mitty living out a personal fantasy,\\" according to Miniter. And the 9/11 Commission, which interviewed Ijaz, concluded that were was no \\"credible evidence\\" that the Sudanese had made any offer to hand over bin Laden. In a 2004 interview with Fox News about Iraq, Ijaz, in his then-capacity as a foreign affairs analyst for the network, made another sensational claim: Chemical warheads were being smuggled into Iraq for a potentially catastrophic attack against American troops. And to top it off, Ijaz strongly suggested that the whole plan was given the green light by hardline Iranian mullahs. The story had everything to attract attention -- Mad mullahs! WMD on the loose in Iraq! (At last!) And the threat of thousands of potential American casualties. Ijaz now concedes, \\"This was an erroneous report based on information I had received from a former intelligence official on the ground in Iraq. I did not second source this story.\\" Ijaz also told CNN, \\"I have written over 170 op-ed columns, appeared over 200 times on television and have not once had a word of what I said retracted due to factual errors.\\" (Ijaz has written one op-ed for CNN.com). Ijaz told Fox in 2003 that \\"eyewitness sources\\" placed Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in Iran. Asked by host Brit Hume about the sourcing of the story, Ijaz responded, \\"I can just tell you that the source is unimpeachable. It is from inside Iran. These are eyewitness accounts.\\" There was, of course, nothing to this story. Ijaz now says, \\"At the time I made it, I believed the source who had given the data to me.\\" Described as a \\"U.S. nuclear proliferation and terrorism expert,\\" Ijaz told the Gulf News newspaper in 2006 that Iran not only had a nuclear bomb, it was seeking to \\"duplicate them in large numbers before revealing their existence to the world.\\" Five years later, Iran still does not have a nuclear weapon, but Ijaz asserted to CNN, \\"They had in my view then, and it remains my view now, at least one nuclear weapon stored in component parts.\\" In August 2003 Ijaz told the British newspaper The Guardian that he had learned that the Bush administration had brokered a deal with Pakistan's dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, not to capture or kill bin Laden so as not to cause unrest in the Muslim world. Ijaz told The Guardian \\"There was a judgment made that it would be more destabilizing in the longer term (if bin Laden were captured or killed). There would still be the ability to get (bin Laden) at a later date when it was more appropriate.\\" Ijaz provided no evidence for this claim, and the idea that the Bush administration would do a deal to let bin Laden go free is ludicrous on its face. Ijaz told CNN \\"I stand by my comments, taken in full context, throughout that article.\\" Peeling back the layers of the story. Pakistan's government and Pakistani and American journalists continue to look into story behind \\"Memogate.\\" What is puzzling about all of this -- if the allegations are true that Ambassador Haqqani used Ijaz to propose a deal to remove Pakistan's military leaders to Mullen -- is: Why would Haqqani use Ijaz to do this? After all, Haqqani has many formal and informal contacts at the Pentagon, and Ijaz has a history of making sometimes exaggerated or erroneous claims, and his record as an unsuccessful freelance diplomat with Sudan in the 1990s is a matter of public record. Finally, if Haqqani was looking for a discreet back channel to the Pentagon, Ijaz turned out not to be the ideal messenger as he was the person who outed the whole affair in the pages of the Financial Times last month. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen and Andrew Lebovich.","response":"Mansoor Ijaz, a Pakistani-American businessman, set off a political firestorm in Pakistan with his claims that he brokered an offer from Pakistan's civilian leaders to the Pentagon to unseat the leadership of the Pakistani military. Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, resigned and Ijaz claimed that the proposal to oust the Pakistani Army's leadership was sanctioned by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The scandal, which has already led to Haqqani's downfall, could also damage Pakistan's civilian government, as Haqqani's wife, Farah Ispahani, is President Zardari's spokeswoman. Ijaz said he had evidence in the form of BlackBerry messages exchanged between him and Haqqani. Pakistan's powerful military intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, reportedly traveled to London to \\"forensically test\\" this evidence.

Lack of context: The information provided in the statement is limited and does not reveal the reasons or motivations behind the man's act of jumping on rocks. Without further context, one cannot definitively conclude that the man genuinely enjoys this activity. 2. Temporary situation: The statement describes an action happening at a specific time - just before nightfall. This may suggest that the man's act of jumping on rocks is temporary or occasional, rather than a recurring activity that he enjoys. 3. External factors: Various external factors could contribute to the man's decision to jump on rocks. For example, he might be doing this out of necessity, such as escaping from a dangerous situation or crossing a particularly difficult terrain. Alternatively, he could be participating in an organized activity or event, like a sports competition or a team-building exercise, that involves jumping on rocks. 4. Other motivations: Even if the man's act of jumping on rocks might look enjoyable to an observer, it is essential to recognize that people often engage in activities for reasons other than personal enjoyment. For instance, the man could be doing this as a form of exercise or training, to develop or maintain his physical fitness or agility, or to challenge himself mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. 5. Cultural or religious factors: Cultural and religious factors can also influence people's actions, even if the activities themselves might not be enjoyable or personally fulfilling. This man might be jumping on rocks to fulfill a religious obligation, to honor a cultural tradition, or as part of a larger performance art or storytelling event. Given these considerations, drawing a definitive conclusion about the man's enjoyment of jumping on rocks from the provided statement would be an overly simplistic interpretation. To determine with certainty whether he likes jumping on rocks, additional context or evidence would be needed to better understand his motivations, background, and emotions associated with the activity."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that neither agree with nor contradict each other.

But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.” “Our family is immensely grateful for the support and kindness of all his caregivers over the last year, and for the continuing outpouring of concern and affection from John’s many friends and associated, and the many thousands of people who are keeping him in their prayers,” the statement continued. “God bless and thank you all.” Roberta and John McCain Alex Wong/Getty RELATED: Meghan McCain Thanks Supporters for Their Prayers as Dad John McCain Stops Cancer Treatment To mark Roberta’s 106th birthday on Feb. 7, Sen.

Scanning done since the procedure (a minimally invasive craniotomy with an eyebrow incision) shows that the tissue of concern was completely resected by imaging criteria.” Previously, Sen. McCain had survived three bouts with melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer that can spread to the brain and cause bleeding.

While at the Naval Academy, he earned so many demerits for unsanctioned outings that by graduation he was made to march the equivalent of 17 round trips between Annapolis and the fleshpots of Baltimore. He later regretted finishing fifth from the bottom of his class instead of dead last. As his mother — still alive at 106 — often said, “He was really a scamp.” McCain preferred “maverick.” A distinct, good-natured irreverence was among John McCain’s abiding features, and for decades I saw it firsthand. He kept friends at his side during both of his presidential campaigns—not only to tell him the unpleasant truth when he made mistakes dealing with the press or answering town-hall questions, but also to share in his biting wit and wry sense of humor. When turbulence frightened the local politicians aboard a flight across the Midwest, McCain put them at ease with one line delivered cool as ice: “You are safe. I know that I won’t die in a plane crash — I already tried that three times.” He was referring to his naval career, which involved two crashes before he was famously shot down over North Vietnam. Sometimes McCain’s humor struck closer to the bone. On the morning of the 2008 New Hampshire primary, he addressed the press outside a hotel owned by his friend Steve Duprey. Asked for his thoughts on the primary, with Duprey at his side, McCain answered: “I am so glad to be leaving this terrible hotel, with threadbare towels, thin soap and cheap furniture.” An expanded version of this article appears at WSJ.com Popular at WSJ.com Trump Organization CFO granted immunity by prosecutors in Cohen investigation Michael Cohen guilty plea reveals link to Qatari royal family ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Roberta McCain, Sen.

Her case became highly publicized due to the graphic nature of the crime, which entailed her corpse having been mutilated and severed at the waist. A native of Boston, Short had spent her early life in Massachusetts and Florida before relocating to California, where her father lived. The notoriety of Short's murder has spurred a large number of confessions over the years, many of which have been deemed false. Since the initial investigation, over 500 people have confessed to the crime, some of whom were not even born at the time of her death. Sergeant John P. St. John, a detective who worked the case until his retirement, stated, \\"It is amazing how many people offer up a relative as the killer.\\" During the initial investigation into her murder, police received a total of 60 confessions, most made by men, but several from women. In 2003, Ralph Asdel, one of the original detectives on the case, told the Los Angeles Times that he believed he had interviewed Short's killer, a man who had been seen with his sedan parked near the vacant lot where Short's body was discovered in the early morning hours of January 15, 1947. A neighbor who drove by that morning had planned on dropping a bag full of lawn clippings in the vacant lot when he saw a parked sedan, allegedly with his right rear door open; the driver of the sedan was standing in the lot. The neighbor's arrival apparently startled the owner of the sedan, who approached his car and peered in the window before returning to the sedan and driving away from the lot. The owner of the sedan was followed to a local restaurant where he worked, but was ultimately cleared of suspicion.

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. Prior to the 1999 free-agency period, the Rams chose Warner to be one of the team's five unprotected players in the 1999 NFL Expansion Draft. Warner went unselected by the Cleveland Browns, who chose no Rams and whose only quarterback selection was Scott Milanovich. The Rams let Bono leave in free agency and signed Trent Green to be the starter. Banks was traded to the Ravens, and Warner now found himself second on the depth chart. After Green tore his ACL in a preseason game, Rams coach Dick Vermeil named Warner as the Rams' starter. In an emotional press conference, Vermeil--who hadn't seen Warner work with the first-string offense--said, \\"We will rally around Kurt Warner, and we'll play good football.\\" With the support of running back Marshall Faulk and wide receivers Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Az-Zahir Hakim, and Ricky Proehl, Warner put together one of the top seasons by a quarterback in NFL history, throwing for 4,353 yards with 41 touchdown passes and a completion rate of 65.1%. The Rams' high-powered offense, run by offensive coordinator Mike Martz, was nicknamed \\"The Greatest Show on Turf\\" and registered the first in a string of three consecutive 500-point seasons, an NFL record. Warner threw three touchdown passes in each of his first three NFL starts; he is the only NFL quarterback in history to accomplish that feat. Warner drew more attention in the Rams' fourth game of the season, a home game against the San Francisco 49ers (who had been NFC West division champions for 12 of the previous 13 seasons). The Rams had lost their last 17 meetings with the 49ers, but Warner proceeded to throw a touchdown pass on each of the Rams' first three possessions of the game, and four touchdowns in the first half alone, to propel the Rams to a 28-10 halftime lead on the way to a 42-20 victory. Warner finished the game with five touchdown passes, giving him 14 in four games and the Rams a 4-0 record. Warner's breakout season from a career in anonymity was so unexpected that Sports Illustrated featured him on their October 18 cover with the caption \\"Who Is This Guy?\\" He was named the 1999 NFL MVP at the season's end for leading the Rams to their first playoff berth since 1989 (when they were still in Los Angeles) and their first division title since 1985. In the NFL playoffs, Warner ultimately led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. In the game, he threw for two touchdowns and a then Super Bowl-record 414 passing yards, including a 73-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce when the game was tied with just over two minutes to play, which proved to be the game-winning score. Warner also set a Super Bowl record by attempting 45 passes without a single interception. For his performance, Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award. Did they go to the playoffs","response":"Yes, Kurt Warner led the Rams to the playoffs in the 1999 NFL season. They clinched their first playoff berth since 1989 and their first division title since 1985.

Remove the tick. Save the tick. Go to the doctor. Wash the area of the tick bite. Submit the tick for testing.\\" Article:","response":"Title: A Guide to Tackling Dangerous Tick Encounters: Detection, Removal, and Testing Introduction Ticks are small parasitic arachnids that feed on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Over the years, ticks have become notorious for transmitting various diseases, such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and many more. Given their potential to cause serious health issues, it is essential to be vigilant when traversing through tick-prone areas, and to act quickly if a tick is found attached to the skin. In this article, we outline and explain a five-step process for coping with tick bites: detection, removal, storage, medical consultation, and testing. Step 1: Look for Ticks Ticks are commonly found in forested areas, grasslands, and regions with abundant vegetation. After spending time outdoors in such environments, it is crucial to inspect the body thoroughly, paying close attention to hard-to-reach and inconspicuous regions like the scalp, back of the neck, behind the knees, and between the toes. Step 2: Remove the Tick If a tick is discovered, it is important to remove it promptly. To do so, follow these steps: 1. Equip yourself with a pair of fine-tipped tweezers. 2. Grasp the tick as close to the skin's surface as possible. 3. Steadily pull the tick upward, being careful to avoid twisting or squishing it, as this could increase the risk of infection. 4. If mouthparts break off and remain in the skin, remove them with clean tweezers. However, if this is difficult, it is advisable to seek medical assistance. Step 3: Save the Tick Once the tick has been removed, it is important to save it for potential testing. Store the tick in a sealed container or a small plastic bag with a damp cotton ball to preserve its condition. Label the container or bag with the date and location of the tick bite, as this information may be valuable to doctors in diagnosing potential diseases. Step 4: Go to the Doctor After removing the tick, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional, especially if symptoms such as fever, rash, or muscle pain begin to arise. The doctor will examine the affected area, inquire about potential symptoms, and provide guidance on further actions, such as prescribing antibiotics or recommending that the tick be tested. Step 5: Wash the Area of the Tick Bite Upon returning from the doctor's office, carefully wash the area around the tick bite with warm water and soap, ensuring that any potential germs are removed. Additionally, applying an antiseptic ointment or rubbing alcohol can help to prevent infections. Step 6: Submit the Tick for Testing If the doctor recommends testing the tick for potential diseases, submit the saved specimen to a local health department or laboratory. The results of the analysis can help to determine if any infections have been transmitted. This information will prove invaluable in determining the correct course of treatment and ensuring a prompt recovery. Conclusion Ticks, despite their small size, can pose a significant risk to human health. By following the outlined steps - detecting ticks on the body, properly removing them, saving the specimen, seeking medical consultation, and submitting the tick for testing if necessary - individuals can minimize the potential consequences of tick bites and safeguard their health."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"(2).\\" sentiment ( (1). negative (2). positive).","response":"Title: A Journey to Remember \\"A Journey to Remember\\" sets itself apart as a heartwarming film that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on its audience.

Tucked away at Manchester City's Carrington HQ is a little transfer gem. Well, maybe not little; 5ft 11ins and 13st of pure muscle, actually. It's Micah Richards - the man once heralded as the undisputed successor to Gary Neville's England right-back. Where did it all go wrong? Micah Richards (centre) appears to have no future at Manchester City Next big thing: Micah Richards broke on to the scene with a last-minute equaliser for City at Aston Villa in 2006 From being one of Europe's hottest teenage properties, Richards' chances of first-team football under Manuel Pellegrini are virtually non-existent. As he explained at the time: 'I have always said I wanted to play for","response":"Manchester City for the entirety of my career, but things have changed quite drastically. I made my debut at a very young age and quickly rose through the ranks, earning many admirers and putting in performances that showed a lot of promise. But as the years went by, I've found myself struggling to maintain that same level of consistency and growth.' This sudden decline in his career can be attributed to a combination of factors. To start with, injuries have played a significant role. In 2008, Micah Richards suffered a serious knee injury which took him out of action for several months. Returning from such a major injury was tough – both physically and mentally – and threw Richards off his usual game. Since then, he has dealt with several other injuries, which have all hampered his progress and development. Beyond the injuries, the emergence of competition within Manchester City's ranks has proved a formidable obstacle for Richards. The club's financial investment in top talent has seen world-class talents like Pablo Zabaleta and Kyle Walker, among others, vying for the right-back position. This intense competition grew even fiercer under Manuel Pellegrini's tenure, leaving little room for Richards to carve out a regular place in the starting lineup. Another contributing factor is the change in management and playing styles that have come with it. Throughout Richards' time at Manchester City, he has played under several different managers, including Roberto Mancini, Mark Hughes, and Pellegrini himself. Each manager has brought their own vision and tactics to the team, making it difficult for Richards to adapt and thrive under a constantly changing environment. Recognizing that his opportunities at Manchester City were dwindling, Richards sought to revive his career by going out on loan. In 2014, he joined Serie A side Fiorentina, where he had hoped to find success and regain his form. Unfortunately, his time in Italy was largely forgettable, and he returned to Manchester City without having made a significant impact abroad. Despite these setbacks, Richards remains optimistic about his future. He has expressed a willingness to consider moving to another club in pursuit of more consistent first-team football, as he still believes he has a lot to offer on the field. His passion for the game is as strong as ever, and he is determined to do whatever it takes to prove to himself – and the world – that he can still perform at the highest level. In conclusion, Micah Richards' fall from potential superstardom can be attributed to a mixture of injuries, intense competition, managerial shifts, and the inability to regain form during loan spells. However, at just 33 years old, there's still time for Richards to find the right club and environment to rediscover his potential and successfully re-enter the footballing world as a top player. And although his journey hasn't gone as planned, he remains a perfect example of the resilience required to make it in the challenging and ever-changing realm of professional football."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: The EU has adopted ambitious plans in the area of emission reductions, funding, forestry and technology transfer.","response":"Uniunea Europeană a adoptat planuri mărețe în domeniul reducerii emisiilor, finanțării, silviculturii și transferului de tehnologie.

New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race.

Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan. \\"I would like a large--\\" \\"--a large dipped cone, the usual. Right?\\" The Dairy Queen drive-thru ordering station was located out in front of the restaurant, on the right side. He looked up, and saw the 19 year-old waving at him. She looked so cute in her little Dairy Queen outfit. Fontana was in her first year at Kilgore College. She planned to be an elementary teacher. He knew she would be a good one. Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone. Question: How does Greg feel about Fontana. Options: - He does not like her - He thinks she is cute - He admires her accent - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"He thinks she is cute"},{"question":"Summarize the following: Characteristics should include weights, grades and measurements of components. The color grade of the gemstone should be determined by using comparison gemstones. If any atypical treatments were conducted on your gemstone or if your gemstone is untreated, this should be noted on the appraisal. The value depends on whether you want to insure your jewelry for its actual cash value, its replacement value or its agreed value. Cash value is the value of your jewelry at today’s market rate, not at the purchase price. Replacement value means the insurer will pay you a specific amount according to its current market value at the time of the loss. Agreed value means that you and your insurer settle on a specific value that you will receive in the event of a loss. If your appraisal is for an insurer, then your appraiser should use one of the following forms from the Jewelry Insurance Standards Organization: JISO 805—Jewelry Sales Receipt for Insurance Purposes. This form is used when you are purchasing jewelry and can be completed by the retailer who sold the jewelry to you. JISO 806—Jewelry Document for Insurance Purposes. This form is used when you’re obtaining a second appraisal. JISO 78—Jewelry Insurance Appraisal—Single Item. This form must be completed by a Certified Insurance Appraiser and is a highly detailed description of the item. JISO 79—Jewelry Insurance Appraisal—Multiple Items.

Brought up by poor but musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. Nielsen was born the seventh of twelve children to a poor peasant family in 1865 at Sortelung near Norre Lyndelse, south of Odense on the island of Funen. His father, Niels Jorgensen, was a house painter and traditional musician who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography Min Fynske Barndom (My Childhood on Funen). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837-1881), was a talented musician. Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \\"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin\\". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense. Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 ore and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances. What were his parents names?","response":"Carl Nielsen's parents were Niels Jørgensen and Maren Kirstine Hansen. Niels was a house painter and a traditional musician, while Maren came from a family of sea captains. Both of them were musically talented and played a significant role in nurturing Nielsen's musical abilities during his childhood."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many points did the Raiders score?","response":"Title: The Historical Scoring Performance of the Raiders: An In-depth Analysis As a versatile AI assistant, I must clarify that the question, \\"How many points did the Raiders score?\\" is rather open-ended, as it lacks specifics about the particular event or time frame in question. The Raiders could be referring to a multitude of teams across a broad spectrum of sports (for instance, the Oakland Raiders, now known as the Las Vegas Raiders, in the National Football League, or NRL's Canberra Raiders, and so on.). Even within the same sport, the question could be asking for points scored in a single game, a season, or over the entirety of the team's existence. Considering the general scope of the initial question, this article will focus on the historical cumulative points scored by the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders since the beginning of their inception till the 2020 season. The team, initially known as the Oakland Raiders when it was founded in 1960, has been a part of the American Football landscape for well over 60 years and is one of the most recognized franchises in the NFL. Over the years, the Oakland, later Los Angeles, and now Las Vegas Raiders, have scored tens of thousands of points. The Raiders are an integral part of the NFL, having been a part of many historic games and contributing significantly to the points tally in countless seasons. As of the conclusion of the 2020 season, according to the pro-football reference, the Raiders have scored a total of 26,096 points in regular-season games during their NFL tenure. Summarizing the scoring across individual seasons, the Raiders' best year in terms of points scored would be the 2002 season where they registered a whopping total of 450 points, largely due to the outstanding performances of players like Rich Gannon, Jerry Porter, and Tim Brown among others. On the other hand, their least prolific year concerning points was the 2006 season, where they managed only 168 points. An important point to consider in understanding any team's scoring tally is the format of the game itself. In NFL football, teams can score in a variety of ways: Touchdowns (6 points), Point after touchdowns, also known as extra points, (1 point), Two-point conversions (2 points), Field Goals (3 points), and a less common scoring opportunity involves the defense scoring a safety (2 points). The consistency in scoring for the Raiders has been a testament to the strength and skill of the franchise. Notably, the scoring prowess has been a result of both the offensive and the defensive capabilities of the team - from wide receivers and running backs scoring touchdowns, placekickers adding field goals and extra points, to the defense contributing by ensuring safeties and interceptions that result in points. To answer the question succinctly, the Raiders have scored a substantial amount over the course of their NFL history. The tally up to the 2020 season being 26,096 points in regular games. However, the points scored by the Raiders varies significantly based on the context, whether it be a single game, a specific season, or throughout the team's lifetime. In conclusion, it's important to remember that while points scored provide an important measure for evaluating a team's performance, they do not paint the whole picture. Equally crucial measures such as defense statistics, possession time, and play strategies contribute to the overall strength and success of a team in a competitive league such as the NFL. Please note that for the most accurate and up-to-date points tally, or information on a specific game's score, it is recommended to refer to the official NFL website or trusted sports news outlets."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Options: - bar - cupboard - cabinet - containing drink - refrigerator Please answer and provide answer explanation.","response":"The most common place to store mugs in your house would be in a cupboard or cabinet. This is because cupboards and cabinets offer a protected and organized space for storing kitchenware, including mugs. Storing mugs in a cupboard or cabinet keeps them clean, easily accessible, and less likely to be accidentally damaged. A bar is mainly used for storing and displaying alcoholic beverages, glassware, and bar tools. It is not specifically designed for storing mugs. However, if you have a bar area in your house and it has available storage, you could potentially store mugs there as well. Storing mugs in a container designated for drinks is not ideal, as this could lead to confusion and doesn't provide a suitable location for organizing and keeping the mugs clean. Similarly, storing mugs in the refrigerator is not advisable, as it takes up space in the refrigerator that would be better used for food and drinks.

For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP Student:","response":"Based on the given sequence of commands, we can understand the sequence and convert it into their respective commands. First, let's go through the sequence: - The action I_TURN_RIGHT corresponds to \\"turn right\\". - The action I_JUMP corresponds to \\"jump\\". - The action I_TURN_LEFT corresponds to \\"turn left\\". So, essentially, the sequence is saying: Turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn left, turn left, jump, turn left, turn left, jump, turn left, turn left, jump. However, as the sequence repeats itself multiple times, we could reduce it down to \\"Turn right, jump\\" repeating twice, then \\"Turn around, jump\\" repeating thrice. Therefore, the simpler natural language command would be: \\"turn right and jump twice after turn around and jump thrice\\""},{"question":"Q:This article: One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory. This amuses Fern. contains an answer for the question: Which puppy runs into the forest and needs rescued?, what is it ? A:","response":"The puppy that runs into the forest and needs to be rescued is Mist."},{"question":"Les membres trouveront en annexe une note concernant l’audition publique sur «Un modèle social européen pour l’avenir», qui a eu lieu au cours de la réunion de la commission du 21 mars 2006.

Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","response":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as having a negative connotation. The reviewer seems to be criticizing the film for its overly safe approach and lack of creative risks. They use phrases like \\"nice 'n safe\\" and \\"milquetoast movie of the week\\" to describe the film, which suggest that the movie is bland, generic, and not innovative enough to merit a big-screen release. The term \\"milquetoast\\" is a slang term often employed to describe something that is weak, timid, or lacking in character. In the context of the review, this word implies that the film lacks substance and fails to leave a strong or memorable impression on the audience. Furthermore, comparing the movie to a \\"movie of the week\\" suggests that it has a quality level more suited for TV movies, which are typically lower-budget and less artistically ambitious than theatrical releases. This statement implicates that the film does not meet the higher expectations typically associated with big-screen productions. Overall, this movie review sentence is quite negative, as it conveys disappointment in the film's unimaginative approach and limited ambition. The reviewer implies that the movie might be forgettable and not worth the attention usually reserved for larger, more engaging films that have left more significant impacts on the audience."},{"question":"Saatuamme tilaisuuden harkita tätä tarkistusta olemme nyt päätyneet siihen näkemykseen, että se olisi hylättävä kahdesta syystä. Translate to English","response":"Upon having the opportunity to consider this review, we have now come to the conclusion that it should be rejected for two reasons. Firstly, the review may not accurately or fairly represent the subject under review. It is crucial for an effective evaluation to provide a balanced view that takes into account both the strengths and weaknesses of the matter at hand. This is especially important when it comes to decisions that can have a significant impact on the outcome, such as policymaking or resource allocation. A biased or poorly substantiated review could potentially lead to unproductive decisions, as well as create misunderstandings among stakeholders. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the assessment is based on reliable, objective information and sound reasoning. Secondly, the review process may have been flawed in some way, leading to potential inaccuracies or misinterpretations. This can occur if there has been a lack of adequate communication and collaboration among the reviewers, or if the review process was not transparent and inclusive. In such cases, the evaluators may be susceptible to personal biases and psychological factors that hinder objectivity. Additionally, misplaced emphasis on certain aspects of the matter could lead to an insufficient or directionally skewed analysis. To avoid these pitfalls, it is essential to establish a well-organized review process, characterized by open dialogue, diversity of perspectives, and constructive feedback. In conclusion, the decision to reject the review is based on concerns regarding its validity, fairness, and credibility, as well as issues with the review process itself. It is critical to maintain a high standard of assessment to ensure that the evaluations are both accurate and trustworthy, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and effective outcomes.

Arsenal Football Club was formed as Dial Square in 1886 by workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London, and were renamed Royal Arsenal shortly afterwards. The club was renamed again to Woolwich Arsenal after becoming a limited company in 1893. The club became the first southern member of the Football League in 1893, starting out in the Second Division, and won promotion to the First Division in 1904. The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall. Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, north London; they dropped \\"Woolwich\\" from their name the following year. Arsenal only finished in fifth place in the second division during the last pre-war competitive season of 1914–15, but were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division when competitive football resumed in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.

A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed... - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with... - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over 8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma . - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to... - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile. - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the... - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\". - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more... - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if... - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in... - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%. - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at... - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as... - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States... - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About... - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000... - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not... Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'inception'.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men. answer the following question: Who tries to get information from the paleontologist?

Hugh Grosvenor, however, avoids a significant cut to his £9bn inheritance because the estate is held in a trust. Britain’s generous trust law ensures that the country’s largest fortunes are largely kept intact. This is borne out by statistics which show that duties are a modest source of revenue for the Treasury. HMRC collected total tax of £534bn in 2015-16, of which inheritance tax receipts represented £4.7bn. New Duke of Westminster inherits £9bn fortune aged 25 Read more “The benefits of trusts are that they don’t form part of somebody’s estate,” says Ian Dyall, a manager at the financial adviser Towry. “In a discretionary trust, you have a whole pick list of potential beneficiaries which the trustees can choose to appoint benefits to. Because of that, you can’t point a finger to any potential beneficiary and say that’s your money. Money can stay in the trust and cascade down from generation to generation and nobody pays inheritance tax on it.” Instead of one-off taxation, trusts are subject to charges every 10 years from the anniversary of their creation. Known as the inheritance tax periodic charge, it can amount to 6% of the funds held. There are, however, plenty of loopholes. Agricultural and business property relief applies, and the Grosvenor assets will have been managed to take full advantage of that.

Its holdings range from hi-tech office space in Silicon Valley and a science park in Edinburgh to the freehold on the current US embassy in Grosvenor Square. The jewel is Eaton Square, built close to Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament during the housing boom that followed the Napoleonic wars. Run as a separate legal entity with its own chief executive, Grosvenor Group paid £58m in tax on profits of £527m in 2015, and has 520 employees on its payroll. Its holdings are largely expected to qualify for relief from the inheritance tax periodic charge. “Property is at the frontline over what qualifies and what doesn’t,” said Dyall. “If you run a hotel, that’s a business. If you have a rental property and all you do is collect the rent, that’s not a trading company. That’s an investment.” Wheatsheaf Set up in 2012, Wheatsheaf employs 450 people and invests in food, energy and water security. It runs Grosvenor Farms, one of the largest farms in the UK with more than 6,000 acres in Cheshire and a herd of 1,400 dairy cows. Other businesses include the UK’s largest bull stud, Cogent Breeding, and a hydroelectric plant on the Reay Forest estate in Scotland. With its emphasis on food production, job creation and trading rather than land holding, Wheatsheaf assets are also likely to be exempt from the inheritance tax periodic charge.

It is not a windfall that the young man would have wished for so soon, and follows the sudden death of his father, the sixth duke of Westminster. The late duke was the third richest man in the country and 68th in the world, according to the Forbes billionaires list. Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor became unexpectedly ill on Tuesday on one of the family’s estates near Lancashire in the north of England. He died later in the hospital at the age of 64. The younger Grosvenor will now inherit a portfolio of properties that span vast swaths of central London’s most exclusive neighborhoods, including Belgravia and Mayfair. He is the third of four siblings but the only son in the family, making him the heir to the family empire under the now-defunct law of primogeniture, which means men can supersede women to inheritance, regardless of age. Until now, the new billionaire has managed to live his life largely out of the public spotlight despite being born with the title of earl. He is not well known to the British public, and one of the only times he made headlines was for his lavish 21st “black tie and neon”-themed birthday party at the family’s main ancestral home, Eaton Hall. It reportedly cost around £5 million (6.5 million) and was attended by 800 guests, including Prince Harry, who were asked to make a contribution to the young man's wine collection instead of a birthday gift. He attended Newcastle University, where he studied countryside management and earned a reputation among friends for being down to earth. Photos have appeared in the British press in recent days showing him partying with friends much like any other young man. In one image he is wearing a pink teddy bear onesie at a costume party. After graduation, he first worked in estate management for the family company, the Grosvenor Group, then took up his current job as an account manager at bio-bean, a coffee recycling firm that turns waste coffee grounds into advanced biofuels. Despite attempts to lead an ordinary life, the family moves in some of Britain’s most aristocratic circles and has strong ties to the royal family. Grosvenor’s mother, Natalia, is godmother to Prince William and he was named godfather to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s firstborn, Prince George, in 2013. “I do feel sorry for Hugh,” Prince William said. “He will be under enormous pressure. He's a lucky boy to be given all the material things in life, but he'll need to be robust mentally to survive. There are many pitfalls, when one inherits such an enormous amount of money, especially in adolescence.” Grosvenor's parents did not like the British private school system and the four children were given a different upbringing than many of Britain’s wealthiest young people. They were not sent to exclusive private boarding schools like Eton or Harrow but attended a state primary school followed by a private day school. The late duke of Westminster was well known for his philanthropic acts and charitable values, which he actively sought to instill in his children. During an interview with Britain’s Independent newspaper in 1992, he spoke about the responsibilities his then 17-month-old son would have to deal with. Now his son will oversee the Westminster Foundation, which is the grant-making body that looks after the estate's philanthropic giving. It has handed more than £40 million (52 million) in grants to more than 1,500 charitable organizations since 1974, a legacy that the young man will have to strive to live up to. “My main object will be to teach him self-discipline and a sense of duty,” the late duke said of his son. “He's been born with the longest silver spoon anyone can have, but he can't go through life sucking on it. He has to put back what he has been given. He has to see himself as a caretaker, keeping the estates in good shape in his lifetime.” Boyle is a special correspondent.

Britain's generous trust law ensures the country's largest fortunes are kept intact, and while there is a lot of focus on trusts being essentially a legal method of avoiding enormous inheritance tax bills, it is important to note that they do serve other valuable purposes. In the case of the Grosvenor family's wealth, their fortune is held in a trust that includes various companies engaged in property and agriculture businesses, charities, and estate management, which allows the trust to grow and serve as an investment vehicle. The fact that inheritance tax is avoided as a result of the trust structure may be a side effect but it also means that the businesses and revenue generation can continue to evolve without disruption, effectively protecting jobs and investing in communities where they hold their estates."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - The Archeologist is a 1914 American silent short drama film directed by Henry Otto starring Ed, Winifred Greenwood, and John Steppling. - The Shriner's Daughter is a 1913 American silent short film starring Charlotte Burton, Violet Neitz, Helen Armstrong, William Bertram, Edith Borella, Ed Coxen, Reaves Eason, George Field, Winifred Greenwood, Ida Lewis, Nina Richdale and William Tedmarsh. - The Redemption of a Pal is a 1914 American silent drama short directed by Henry Otto starring Edith Borella, Charlotte Burton, George Field, Winifred Greenwood and Edward Coxen. - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"The urinary bladder and external urethral opening are not prominent in birds, as they excrete nitrogenous waste as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine, and do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening."},{"question":"How is \\"Written Statements (Rule 149)\\" said in Romanian?","response":"In Romanian, the term \\"Written Statements (Rule 149)\\" is translated as \\"Declarații scrise (Regula 149)\\". Here's a detailed explanation: 1. \\"Written\\" - This term is translated to Romanian as \\"scrise,\\" which is the plural form of the adjective \\"scris,\\" referring to something that is put in writing or recorded on paper or another medium. 2. \\"Statements\\" - The noun \\"statements\\" pertains to a definite or clear expression of something in speech or writing. In Romanian, the corresponding word is \\"declarații,\\" which is the plural form of \\"declarație.\\" 3. \\"Rule\\" - The English term \\"rule\\" conveys a principle or regulation set up by an organization or authority to govern behavior or actions. In Romanian, the equivalent word for \\"rule\\" is \\"regula.\\" 4. \\"149\\" - The number remains the same in both languages; however, it is pronounced in Romanian as \\"una sută patruzeci și nouă.\\" Hence, \\"Written Statements (Rule 149)\\" becomes \\"Declarații scrise (Regula 149)\\" in Romanian.

Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK","response":"Part #1: Understanding the actions.

'I_TURN_LEFT' represents the action of the agent turning to the left. 'I_LOOK' is the action of the agent looking around. These actions form the basis of the command that we need to form. Part #2: Recognizing the patterns in actions. Usage: In the provided sequence, there's a pattern where 'I_TURN_LEFT' action is repeated twice followed by the 'I_LOOK' action. This pattern repeats multiple times throughout the sequence. Therefore, recognizing such repetitive patterns is crucial to compactly express them in commands. Part #3: Translating actions to commands. Usage: Once the action pattern is identified, it is translated into their corresponding commands. The action 'I_TURN_LEFT' translates to the command 'turn left' and the action 'I_LOOK' translates to 'look'. Part #4: Utilizing words like 'twice', 'thrice' for repetition. Usage: As the actions 'I_TURN_LEFT', 'I_TURN_LEFT' are repeated, they can be compactly represented as 'turn left twice'. Similarly, 'I_LOOK' turns into 'look'. Part #5: Connecting commands using the word 'and'. Usage: Given the nature of the sequence, commands deriving from different parts of it need to be connected by the word 'and'. Taking into account repetition, the full sequence of actions is translated into the command: \\"turn left twice and look and turn left twice and look and turn left twice and look and turn left and look and turn left and look and turn left and look\\".

Cindy and Dean meet at Cindy's grandmother's nursing home while Dean is delivering a new resident's furniture and they begin dating afterwards.

OK, here's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with \\"Satan\\" - is actually a \\"Loki\\"-like trickster god. In other words, he doesn't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa. Not to mention, if he's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, he wouldn't go around cutting off heads, he'd get some good rum and cigars and par-TAY!!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is \\"spooky\\") they didn't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I've done research. (Anyone remember the old late-night ad for phone-in tarot readings - \\"The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love...\\" and all that nonsense?) If you made it this far through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me, so please don't.

The game and its sequel ( Cybersphere Plus ) have recently been released as freeware by the designer . It was designed by Clay Hellman and published by Psycon Software . Cybersphere uses OPL3 FM sound synthesis chip and therefore may require a use of an emulator such as DOSBox for the audio to work . - Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rightsusually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights. - Overview. The player controls the \\"Vaus\\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \\"paddle\\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same. - Freeware is proprietary software that is available for use at no monetary cost. In other words, freeware may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader. - Skype is an application that provides video chat and voice call services. Users may exchange such digital documents as images, text, video and any other, and may transmit both text and video messages. Skype allows the creation of video conference calls. - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. - A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are \\"fired\\" and \\"non-fired\\" bricks. - A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term \\"laser\\" originated as an acronym for \\"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light \\"coherently\\". Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond. - In video games, power-ups are objects that instantly benefit or add extra abilities to the game character as a game mechanic. This is in contrast to an item, which may or may not have a benefit and can be used at a time chosen by the player. Although often collected directly through touch, power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items, such as the floating letters of the word 'EXTEND' in \\"Bubble Bobble\\". Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from \\"Pac-Man\\" (regarded as the first power-up) and the Super Mushroom from \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", which ranked first in UGO Networks' \\"Top 11 Video Game Powerups\\".

Barbirolli is remembered as an interpreter of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Mahler, as well as Schubert, Beethoven, Sibelius, Verdi and Puccini, and as a staunch supporter of new works by British composers. Vaughan Williams dedicated his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies to Barbirolli, whose nickname, \\"Glorious John\\", comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote at the head of the score of the Eighth: \\"For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph.\\" Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire. The music critic Richard Osborne wrote that, if all Barbirolli's recordings were to be lost except that of Lehár's Gold and Silver Waltz, \\"there would be reason enough to say, 'Now, there was a conductor!'\\"Barbirolli's repertoire was not as wide as that of many of his colleagues because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: \\"We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they're only sporting events.\\" Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, \\"it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade.\\" He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal. Answer:","response":"The last name of the person who found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years is Barbirolli.

The activities of multinational companies based in Ireland have made it one of the largest exporters of pharmaceutical agents, medical devices and software-related goods and services in the world. Ireland's exports also relate to the activities of large Irish companies and exports of mineral resources: Ireland is the seventh largest producer of zinc concentrates, and the twelfth largest producer of lead concentrates. The country also has significant deposits of gypsum, limestone, and smaller quantities of copper, silver, gold, barite, and dolomite. Tourism in Ireland contributes about 4% of GDP and is a significant source of employment. Other goods exports include agri-food, cattle, beef, dairy products, and aluminum. Ireland's major imports include data processing equipment, chemicals, petroleum and petroleum products, textiles, and clothing. Financial services provided by multinational corporations based at the Irish Financial Services Centre also contribute to Irish exports.

Article: Modern man has cleared the forests for farmland and for wood, and has also carelessly burned them. More than that, though, he has also interfered with the invisible bonds between the living things in the forests. There are many examples of this kind of destruction. The harmfulness of man's interference can be seen in what happened many years ago in the forest of the Kaibab plateau of northern Arizona. Man tried to improve on the natural web of forest life and destroyed it instead. The Kaibab had a storybook forest of large sized pine, Douglas fir, white fir, blue and _ . In 1882 a visitor noted, \\"We, who ... have wandered through its forests and parks, have come to regard it as the most enchanting region it has ever been our privilege to visit.\\" This was also the living place of the Rocky Mountain mule deer. Indians hunted there every autumn to gather meat and skins. The forest also had mountain lions, timber wolves and bobcats that kept the deer from multiplying too rapidly. Then, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve. Deer hunting was forbidden. Government hunters started killing off the deer's enemies. In 25 years' time, 6,250 mountain lions, wolves and bobcats were killed. Before the program, there were about 4,000 deer in the Kaibab, by 1924, there were about 100,000. The deer ate every leaf and twig they could reach. But there was not nearly enough food. Hunting of deer was permitted again. This caused a slight decrease in the deer herd ,but a far greater loss resulted from starvation and disease. Some 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters. By 1930 the herd had dropped to 20,000 animals. By 1942 it was down to 8,000. Question: The number of the deer in the Kaibab had increased enormously in _ years' time. Options: A: 25 B: 6 C: 12 D: 18 Answer:","response":"The number of the deer in the Kaibab had increased enormously in 25 years' time. The option A: 25 is the correct answer. To understand this answer more clearly, let's analyze the situation presented in the article. Before the interference of humans in the forests of the Kaibab Plateau, the ecosystem balanced itself with a natural web of life, where predators like mountain lions, wolves, and bobcats controlled the deer population. This allowed the forest to maintain a stable environment and continue to flourish. In 1906, when President Theodore Roosevelt declared the area a national game preserve, hunting deer became prohibited, and measures were taken to eliminate the predators that, in turn, affected the deer population. Over the course of 25 years, the government killed around 6,250 predators, such as mountain lions, wolves, and bobcats, to protect the deer. As a result of the predator elimination program, the number of deer in the Kaibab region increased rapidly, trying to find a new equilibrium in the altered ecosystem. In just 25 years, the deer population in Kaibab rose from around 4,000 to a staggering 100,000. Unable to support this sudden boom in population, the ecosystem started to suffer, with massive food shortages leading to starvation and disease among the deer. Deer hunting was allowed again in an attempt to control the deer population. However, the forest could not recover quickly enough, and the deer herd saw a significant reduction in numbers due to starvation and disease. By 1930, the herd had dropped to 20,000, and by 1942, only 8,000 deer were left. This situation highlights the impact of human intervention on delicate ecosystems, as the natural balance is disrupted, and the environment suffers. In this case, it took 25 years for the Kaibab Plateau's deer population to undergo a massive increase – and the ultimate consequences of human intervention and the elimination of predators."},{"question":"Question: Joey is planning to throw a small party and for that he needs to do the following tasks: I.

Options: (A) 24 (B) 48 (C) 60 (D) 120 (E) 240 Random thoughts:","response":"To find the number of ways Joey can do the five tasks listed above, we can use permutations. We know that the guest list must be decided before sending invites, but the other tasks can be done in any order. First, let's fix the order of the tasks \\"decide guest list\\" (task I) and \\"send invites\\" (task II).

With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - The Tux Alps or Tux Prealps (\\"Tuxer Voralpen\\") are a sub-group of the Austrian Central Alps, which in turn form part of the Eastern Alps within Central Europe. They are located entirely within the Austrian federal state of Tyrol. The Tux Alps are one of three mountain ranges that form an Alpine backdrop to the city of Innsbruck. Their highest peak is the Lizumer Reckner, , which rises between the glen of Wattentaler Lizum and the valley of the Navisbach. Their name is derived from the village of Tux which is tucked away in a side valley of the Zillertal. - The Ziller is an approximately 47 km long right-side tributary to the Inn River, in the Zillertal in Tyrol, Austria. It springs from the ridge of the Zillertal Alps, and feeds the Zillergründl Dam. In Mayrhofen it receives the Zemmbach (that in turn receives the Tuxerbach). By Zell am Ziller it receives the Gerlosbach, before it flows into the Inn by Strass im Zillertal. - The Kitzbühel Alps (or \\"Kitzbühler Alpen\\") are a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps surrounding the town of Kitzbühel in Tyrol, Austria. Geologically they are part of the western slate zone (greywacke zone). - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.

Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking) and for reasons of style and fashion. - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - The Central Eastern Alps, also referred to as Austrian Central Alps or just Central Alps comprise the main chain of the Eastern Alps in Austria and the adjacent regions of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and Slovenia.

It follows him closely for around 200 pages, through a few comically calamitous days in 1978, as he travels through western Ireland to an island off its coast, bought on a lark 11 years earlier. He’s nearing 40 here; past drugs, past scream therapy, far past the Beatles, and stripped raw emotionally, tired “but not for sleeping,” full of “large sad warmish feelings.” A few days alone on his island, he hopes, will bring him the peace that even marriage and fatherhood, though he loves them, haven’t. The poignant knowledge that this is an end-of-life crisis, not a middle-of-life one: That belongs to us, not to him. These first 200 pages are nearly perfect, observant, melancholy but not mournful, and tremendously funny, largely because John’s endearingly lofty vision of his trip’s purpose, a communion with nature and himself, runs immediately into very practical problems. For starters he has trouble simply finding his island; the local fixer taking care of him, a man named Cornelius who is incapable of fixing anything, doesn’t have a great idea of how to get there. He tries anyway, leading his famous charge through a series of misadventures, as they dodge journalists, visit the pub in disguise and become stranded in a derelict hotel with a few holdovers from the hippie era. And then another character enters the book: Mr. Barry himself. Suddenly it’s 2011, and we’re inside his head as he stands “with all the other hunched pilgrims” outside the Dakota in New York, the apartment building where John Lennon lived and was killed. Mr. Barry realizes something. “If I was going to make beatlebone everything it should be,” he writes, “I needed to get to the island.” And so he sets off. This gesture is at least as old as Laurence Sterne — “baring the device,” literary critics named it nearly a century ago — but in this context it feels startling, even risky, because “Beatlebone” would have been an excellent novel without it, a tender portrait of a man “37 years along the road — the slow-quick, slow-quick road,” as the novel puts it in a typically lovely, darting line. And yet the risk pays off. The hallmark of Mr. Barry’s previous fiction has been his remarkable gift as a stylist; in his only other novel, the much-honored “City of Bohane,” a slangy tale about a gang war in the near future, a glance could be a “lamp,” a “check,” a “sconce” — quick-witted coinages at once low and literary, in that peculiar, flexible Irish fashion. But “City of Bohane” was also, in its thinner moments, filmic in the wrong ways, like a Quentin Tarantino reboot of “West Side Story,” its violence and lurking sentimentality correlated. “Beatlebone” is far more profound. Mr. Barry’s language is still poetic and reaching and imaginative, but now in effortless service to more substantial themes, in particular love and “the way that time moves.” As the novel’s attention alternates between Mr. Barry’s real trip to the island and John’s made up one, the identities of the two men — both artists, both marked by the loss of their mothers — mingle, until their stories begin to overlap more and more exactly, and finally the two become indivisible, ghosts of each other across the decades. The effect is beautiful, reminiscent at different moments of Virginia Woolf and Geoff Dyer, especially the ambiguous narrator of Mr. Dyer’s wonderful novel “Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.” Yet it also leaves lingering a significant question, which is how close this book, as it moves further away from John Lennon, actually ever got us to him. Or is that the author’s point: that any work about an artist is in some sense a self-investigation, and that to introduce yourself into the narrative is the most honest way to admit that? I happen to love the Beatles, so ardently that I sometimes think that if I could preserve the work of any artists from the last century, shipping it down into the care of our descendants, it would be theirs. Which means, of course, loving John Lennon. “Beatlebone” faultlessly captures Lennon’s acidic, self-loathing, yearning, weary side. (And his sense of humor, too, an essential element: “Do you have a reservation?” a hotel clerk asks him. “I have severe ones,” he replies, “but I do need a room.”) What Mr. Barry finds more elusive is the other part of John, which remained innocent enough to create the luminous songs he wrote throughout the 1970s. So when John says late in “Beatlebone,” “I think we should all love and ravish each other but I’m holding out no great hopes,” it’s as if Mr. Barry really were the one speaking, with a novelist’s appreciation for the complex messed-up-ness of the world. John Lennon always did seem to hold out great hopes. Even as the journeys of the author and his protagonist merge, Mr. Barry and Lennon remain stubbornly distinct. But perhaps what ultimately makes this a great novel is its author’s exploration of the ways that sometimes, in art, we do get to become each other — kind of.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Now, I have a new situation: Dan studied two islands. Loon island had a very stable environment, and there weren't many diverse species of plants and animals. Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it. Answer this question please: Which island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits? The answer is:","response":"Wolf Island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits. This is because Wolf Island showed lots of evidence for natural selection, which is the process where beneficial heritable traits become more common in a population. A higher variety of species on Wolf Island indicates that the organisms there have adapted to different ecological niches through the process of natural selection, thus developing and displaying a range of beneficial heritable traits to survive and reproduce in their diverse and changing environment. In contrast, Loon Island had a very stable environment and fewer diverse species, suggesting that the plants and animals there may not have experienced such strong selective pressures to develop and exhibit as many beneficial heritable traits as the organisms on Wolf Island."},{"question":"This is the content of an email: Hi Evening MBA students, The Evening MBA office will be closed for the holidays until Wednesday, January 2.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Siege Movie plot: Following the bombing of an American military installation in the Middle East (the film shows footage from the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing), the U.S. government orchestrates the capture of the mastermind believed to be behind the attack, Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal. In New York City FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives demands to release the sheikh. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA agent Elise Kraft (Bening). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and an MTA bus is bombed, though the children on-board are permitted to leave before the bus is destroyed. When the FBI captures a person of interest named Samir Nazhde he admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The FBI eventually identifies and storms a safehouse belonging to terrorists who are associated with the bombings. However, days later, new terror cells launch more devastating attacks, starting with the bombing of the New Victory Theater in Times Square during an evening performance. This is followed days later by a hostage situation at an elementary school (which is resolved when Hubbard shoots the hostage taker).

She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. and a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Please answer this question : Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries?

The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of . - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy. - The Dvina Bay is located in Arkhangelsk Oblast in Northwestern Russia. It is one of four large bays and gulfs of the White Sea, the others being the Mezen Bay, the Onega Bay, and the Kandalaksha Gulf. The two main river emptying into the Dvina Bay is the Northern Dvina River, while the two cities on the bay are Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk. The Dvina Bay is long and wide. Administratively, the coast and the islands belong to Primorsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city. - Arkhangelsk, also known in English as Archangel and Archangelsk, is a city and the administrative center of Arkhangelsk Oblast, in the north of European Russia. It lies on both banks of the Northern Dvina River near its exit into the White Sea. The city spreads for over along the banks of the river and numerous islands of its delta. Arkhangelsk was the chief seaport of medieval and early modern Russia until 1703. A railway runs from Arkhangelsk to Moscow via Vologda and Yaroslavl, and air travel is served by the Talagi Airport and a smaller Vaskovo Airport. As of the 2010 Census, the city's population was 348,783, down from 356,051 recorded in the 2002 Census, and further down from 415,921 recorded in the 1989 Census. - The White Sea (\\"Beloye more\\"; Karelian and , lit. Dvina Sea \\"Serako yam\\") is a southern inlet of the Barents Sea located on the northwest coast of Russia. It is surrounded by Karelia to the west, the Kola Peninsula to the north, and the Kanin Peninsula to the northeast. The whole of the White Sea is under Russian sovereignty and considered to be part of the internal waters of Russia. Administratively, it is divided between Arkhangelsk and Murmansk Oblasts and the Republic of Karelia. - The Pechora River (Komi: ; Nenets: ) is a river in northwest Russia which flows north into the Arctic Ocean on the west side of the Ural Mountains. It lies mostly in the Komi Republic but the northernmost part crosses the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. - The Solovetsky Islands, or Solovki, are an archipelago located in the Onega Bay of the White Sea, Russia. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\", \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwblïkas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources. - Belarus ( lat. ', ), officially the Republic of Belarus, formerly known by its Russian name Byelorussia (though this name is no longer used in Belarus itself, even in Russian language), is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. - Novaya Zemlya (lit. \\"new land\\"), also known, especially in Dutch, as Nova Zembla, is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean in northern Russia and the extreme northeast of Europe, the easternmost point of Europe lying at Cape Flissingsky on the Northern island. Administratively, it is incorporated as Novaya Zemlya District, one of the twenty-one in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. Municipally, it is incorporated as Novaya Zemlya Urban Okrug. - Kyrgyzstan (; \\"Kyrgyzstan\\"), officially the Kyrgyz Republic (\\"Krgz Respublikas\\"; \\"Kyrgyzskaya Respublika\\"), formerly known as Kirghizia, is a country in Central Asia. Landlocked and mountainous, Kyrgyzstan is bordered by Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the west and southwest, Tajikistan to the southwest and China to the east. Its capital and largest city is Bishkek. - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population: - Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. - Severodvinsk ( Russian : ; IPA : ( svrdvinsk ) ) is a city in the north of Arkhangelsk Oblast , Russia , located in the delta of the Northern Dvina River , 35 kilometers ( 22 mi ) west of Arkhangelsk , the administrative center of the oblast . As of the 2010 Census , the population was 192,353 . - Vaskovo Airport (Russian: ) is an airport in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia located 13 km southwest of central Arkhangelsk as the crow flies but 19 km by road. It is 10 km west of Isakogorka station. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'shares border with' with 'primorsky district'.

After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,...

I’m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals. One of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn’t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant. It’s free from parabens, allergens and aluminium and uses astringent plant extracts that shrink the sweat pores to reduce perspiration whilst natural herb sage acts as a deodoriser. Available in three fragrances – Active, Floral and Care – I’ve been using the Floral Soft & Gentle 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant for over 2 weeks and I’ve really put it through its paces as the temperature has been fairly hot and humid for the last fortnight. With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success – dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare? With regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I’ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I’ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they’ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I’ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk.

I voted with my feet and became an American because I love this country and think it is exceptional. But when I look at the world today and the strong winds of technological change and global competition, it makes me nervous. Perhaps most unsettling is the fact that while these forces gather strength, Americans seem unable to grasp the magnitude of the challenges that face us. Despite the hyped talk of China's rise, most Americans operate on the assumption that the U.S. is still No. 1. But is it? Yes, the U.S. remains the world's largest economy, and we have the largest military by far, the most dynamic technology companies and a highly entrepreneurial climate. But these are snapshots of where we are right now. The decisions that created today's growth  decisions about education, infrastructure and the like  were made decades ago. What we see today is an American economy that has boomed because of policies and developments of the 1950s and '60s: the interstate-highway system, massive funding for science and technology, a public-education system that was the envy of the world and generous immigration policies. Look at some underlying measures today, and you will wonder about the future. (Watch TIME's video \\"Why Cities Are Key to American Success in the 21st Century.\\") The following rankings come from various lists, but they all tell the same story. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), our 15-year-olds rank 17th in the world in science and 25th in math. We rank 12th among developed countries in college graduation (down from No. 1 for decades). We come in 79th in elementary-school enrollment. Our infrastructure is ranked 23rd in the world, well behind that of every other major advanced economy. American health numbers are stunning for a rich country: based on studies by the OECD and the World Health Organization, we're 27th in life expectancy, 18th in diabetes and first in obesity. Only a few decades ago, the U.S. stood tall in such rankings. No more. There are some areas in which we are still clearly No. 1, but they're not ones we usually brag about. We have the most guns. We have the most crime among rich countries. And, of course, we have by far the largest amount of debt in the world. The Rise of the Rest Many of these changes have taken place not because of America's missteps but because other countries are now playing the same game we are  and playing to win. There is a familiar refrain offered when these concerns are raised: \\"We heard all this in the 1980s. Japan was going to dominate the globe. It didn't happen, and America ended up back on top.\\" It's a fair point as far as it goes. Japan did not manage to become the world's richest country  though for three decades it had the second largest economy and even now has the third largest. It is also a relatively small country. To become the largest economy in the world, it would have to have a per capita GDP twice that of the U.S. China would need to have an average income only one-fourth that of the U.S. to develop an economy that would surpass ours. (See Americans who are facing long-term unemployment.) But this misses the broader point. The Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, who has just written a book, Civilization: The West and the Rest, puts things in historical context: \\"For 500 years the West patented six killer applications that set it apart. The first to download them was Japan. Over the last century, one Asian country after another has downloaded these killer apps  competition, modern science, the rule of law and private property rights, modern medicine, the consumer society and the work ethic. Those six things are the secret sauce of Western civilization.\\" To this historical challenge from nations that have figured out how the West won, add a technological revolution. It is now possible to produce more goods and services with fewer and fewer people, to shift work almost anywhere in the world and to do all this at warp speed. That is the world the U.S. now faces. Yet the country seems unready for the kind of radical adaptation it needs. The changes we are currently debating amount to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. (Comment on this story.) Sure, the political system seems to be engaged in big debates about the budget, pensions and the nation's future. But this is mostly a sideshow. The battles in state capitals over public-employee pensions are real  the states are required to balance their budgets  but the larger discussion in Washington is about everything except what's important. The debate between Democrats and Republicans on the budget excludes the largest drivers of the long-term deficit  Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare  to say nothing of the biggest nonentitlement costs, like the tax break for interest on mortgages. Only four months ago, the Simpson-Bowles commission presented a series of highly intelligent solutions to our fiscal problems, proposing 4 trillion in savings, mostly through cuts in programs but also through some tax increases. They have been forgotten by both parties, in particular the Republicans, whose leading budgetary spokesman, Paul Ryan, praises the commission in the abstract even though he voted against its recommendations. Democrats, for their part, became apoplectic about a proposal to raise the retirement age for Social Security by one year  in 2050. Instead, Washington is likely to make across-the-board cuts in discretionary spending, where there is much less money and considerably less waste. President Obama's efforts to preserve and even increase resources for core programs appear to be failing in a Congress determined to demonstrate its clout. But reducing funds for things like education, scientific research, air-traffic control, NASA, infrastructure and alternative energy will not produce much in savings, and it will hurt the economy's long-term growth. It would happen at the very moment that countries from Germany to South Korea to China are making large investments in education, science, technology and infrastructure. We are cutting investments and subsidizing consumption  exactly the opposite of what are the main drivers of economic growth. See \\"The End of Prosperity?\\" See a graphic showing Amercia's decline. ||||| Illustration by Joe Magee for TIME Poor U.S. of A., forever in decline. the arrival of public theaters in Boston circa 1790 caused Samuel Adams to despair for the cause of liberty in the face of such debauchery. \\"Alas!\\" he wrote. \\"Will men never be free!\\" Charles Lindbergh fretted, \\"It seems improbable that we could win a war in Europe.\\" Long before baseball, hand-wringing was the national pastime. We've never been virtuous enough, civilized enough, smart enough or resolute enough. I was born into a country reeling from Sputnik, which revealed to the whole world that Americans are as dumb as rocks. John F. Kennedy had just been elected President, in part by bemoaning the \\"missile gap\\" between the mighty Soviet arsenal and our paltry few bottle rockets. \\"The United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead,\\" Kennedy said in his final debate with Richard M. Nixon. That's the same Nixon who declared eight years later, \\"We are worse off in every area of the world tonight than we were when President Eisenhower left office.\\" Hard to believe we could sink further, but we did, as the nightmare of Vietnam segued into the nightmare of Watergate, while the Japanese exposed the insufficiency of American enterprise. As I stumbled off to college, President Jimmy Carter was warning us about \\"a crisis of confidence ... that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will.\\" Thanks to our horrible schools, we were  according to the title of a major 1983 report  \\"A Nation at Risk.\\" Then our family values went down the toilet. (See the Recession of 1958.) You'd think America would be as washed up by now as the Captain and Tennille. So how come we're so much stronger than we were 50 years ago? Somehow, in the 235 years since we got started, Americans have weathered Boston theaters and Soviet science prodigies, violent lyrics and sex out of wedlock. We've survived a Civil War, two world wars and a Great Depression, not to mention immigrant hordes, alcohol, Freemasons and the \\"vast wasteland\\" of network television. We've dodged the population bomb, the coming ice age, acid rain and the domino effect. America is to nations what Roberto Clemente was to right fielders. The Pirates legend fretted endlessly about how poorly he felt and how sick he was  while vigorously spraying hits and vacuuming fly balls. So don't reach for the defibrillator paddles or the rosary beads quite yet. Overblown Symptoms These days, the doctors diagnosing American decline tend to focus on two types of disease. Some worry about deteriorating \\"social capital\\"  inadequate education, a demoralized workforce, dysfunctional politics. Others focus on the physical fitness of our economic edifice: the scale of investment, the level of debt, the fractures in the infrastructure. If you collect enough symptoms, you can make a strong-sounding case that the country is indeed quite sick. But fallen trees don't prove the forest is dying. And some of the most cited symptoms are overblown. Take the much discussed problem of income inequality. A very small number of superwealthy people are pocketing nearly all the growth in our national income. That sounds dire for a nation founded on the ideal of equality. It isn't, though, for a couple of reasons. First, a significant part of the rise in inequality is an illusion. Changes to the tax code since the 1980s have created strong incentives for owners of private businesses and certain partnerships to report their business earnings as personal income. This didn't necessarily change the amount of money in their pockets; it just meant that money is recorded in a different column of Uncle Sam's ledger. This expansion of so-called Subchapter S corporations and LLCs inflated the tax returns of the very rich  primarily the top 0.5% of all taxpayers. If the tax laws are changed again, money will shift again. Count on that.

Democrats, for their part, became apoplectic about a proposal to raise the retirement age for Social Security by one year  in 2050. Instead, Washington is likely to make across-the-board cuts in discretionary spending, where there is much less money and considerably less waste. President Obama's efforts to preserve and even increase resources for core programs appear to be failing in a Congress determined to demonstrate its clout. But reducing funds for things like education, scientific research, air-traffic control, NASA, infrastructure and alternative energy will not produce much in savings, and it will hurt the economy's long-term growth. It would happen at the very moment that countries from Germany to South Korea to China are making large investments in education, science, technology and infrastructure. We are cutting investments and subsidizing consumption  exactly the opposite of what are the main drivers of economic growth.

While the U.S. remains the world's largest economy, has the largest military, and maintains a highly entrepreneurial climate, these are merely snapshots of the present and not guarantees for the future. The success of the U.S. today can be attributed to policies and developments from the 1950s and 60s, such as the interstate-highway system, significant funding for science and technology, a leading public-education system, and generous immigration policies. However, current rankings show a different story. American 15-year-olds rank 17th in the world for science and 25th in math. The U.S. ranks 12th among developed countries in college graduation rates, 79th in elementary-school enrollment, and 23rd in terms of infrastructure. Furthermore, the country's health numbers are concerning, placing 27th in life expectancy, 18th in diabetes, and first in obesity. As other countries adopt the key drivers of Western civilization and combine that with an ongoing technological revolution, the United States seems unprepared for the kind of radical adaptation it needs to maintain its leading position in the world. The political system appears to be debating important issues such as budget, pensions, and the nation's future, but these discussions often exclude the most significant drivers of long-term deficit, such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. Meanwhile, countries like Germany, South Korea, and China continue to make large investments in education, science, technology, and infrastructure, while the U.S. focuses on cutting investments and subsidizing consumption."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Article: When my friend Lesa was diagnosed with cancer, another friend and I went to the hospital to spend some time with her. We bought her a small toy and named him Lemon-Aide. We gave Lemon-Aide to Lesa and told her he was to go with her to all of her treatments to remind her that we were thinking of her and caring about her even though we could not always be with her. When the treatments were completed, she said when someone else needed him she would pass him along. A few months later,much to my surprise, it was me that she passed him to. Lemon-Aide went with me to all of my treatments. One day while waiting for my doctor I decided we could market the idea to fight cancer. Lesa thought it was a great idea so we founded the organization that came to be known as Lemon-Aide' s Friends, Inc. We designed our organization to remind people fighting cancer that there are people who love and care about them all the time. Today we have totally 5013 volunteers. The money raised is donated to cancer patients who do not have insurance. The physicians on our Board of Advisors determine how and where our money is donated. Lemon-Aide is for men, women, and children of all ages and to date has been sent to 34 states and 33 countries to provide smiling support for people fighting cancer. When life gave us lemons we made Lemon-Aide, a soft smiling toy that represents love, support, and encouragement. Question: The author went to the hospital with her friend _ .

Rudy Giuliani appears to have forgotten that. The reaction of the former Big Apple mayor known for his love of a good fight can only be described as that of a humorless, “nasty” man. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton roasted Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, for defending Trump’s questionable personal tax practices. Watch Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton make jokes at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York, Oct. 20. (The Washington Post) As she rhetorically strolled through the dignitaries, Clinton said, “And we have Rudy Giuliani.” Just mentioning his name set off laughter. But all the camera found was the unsmiling face New Yorkers were happy was term-limited. “Now, many don’t know this,” Clinton continued, “but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, ‘If you can’t beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.’ ” The crowd roared. Giuliani sat as if he were perched on Mount Rushmore. The look on his face was a flashback moment for me. Back to those days during his mayoralty when jokes at his expense were not tolerated. Remember, this is the same guy who waged a public battle with New York magazine in 1997 ​against its ads on city buses that read, “Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn’t taken credit for.” A federal judge ordered the transportation authority to restore the ads. Of course, Giuliani disagreed and whined to the press, “I think that mayors retain certain privacy rights, particularly the right to not have your name used for a commercial purpose.” [Hillary Clinton was right. Donald Trump is ‘horrifying’] During his eight years in City Hall, Giuliani alternated between mean and nasty as he and his administration beat crime (and dissent) into submission. His critiques of opponents and adversaries were withering and personal, much like those of his preferred presidential candidate. Giuliani’s reaction Thursday night to a good-natured, yet pointed knock against him was typical for bullies. They can dish it, but they can’t take it — especially from “such a nasty woman.” Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj Subscribe to Cape Up, Jonathan Capehart’s weekly podcast Title:","response":"\\"Al Smith Dinner: When Candidates Laugh and Rudy Giuliani Forgets to Smile\\""},{"question":"Consider the question.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: yes?","response":"In the question, we are given the sentence \\"Two asian females are doing a dance in native costume.\\" and asked whether we can conclude that \\"There are women dancing in costumes.\\" To determine if this is true, let's follow a step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Identify the main elements of the original sentence: This sentence has three main pieces of information: the number of people involved (two), the nature of their activity (doing a dance), and their attire (native costume). 2. Determine the equivalent elements in the conclusion statement: The statement we want to confirm, \\"There are women dancing in costumes,\\" has a more general description, and deals with three similar elements: the presence of people (women), the nature of their activity (dancing), and their attire (costumes). 3. Compare the original elements to the conclusion elements: a. Number and nature of people involved: The original sentence mentioned \\"Two asian females\\" which can be categorized more broadly as \\"women.\\" This matches the conclusion statement. b. Activity: The original sentence states \\"doing a dance\\" which can be reworded as \\"dancing.\\" The conclusion statement also lists the activity as \\"dancing.\\" c. Attire: The original sentence describes them as wearing \\"native costume,\\" while in the conclusion statement, it is simply described as \\"costumes.\\" The term \\"costumes\\" is a broader category that includes \\"native costume\\" within it. 4. Conclude the answer: Since all three elements in the original sentence can be matched to and fit within the more general elements of the conclusion statement, we can say that it is indeed accurate to conclude that \\"There are women dancing in costumes.\\" Therefore, the final answer is 'yes.'"},{"question":"Instructions: You will be given a context and a question in Spanish.

The article discusses the case of Russian shot putter Irina Korzhanenko, who was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol. The incident occurred during the Olympics, a major international sporting event. Doping tests are a standard part of sports competitions, particularly at the elite level, because the use of performance-enhancing drugs provides an unfair advantage and goes against the values of fair play and sportsmanship. The story of Korzhanenko highlights the ongoing issue of doping in sports and the measures taken by sports governing bodies to ensure fair and equal competition. Doping scandals have affected numerous athletes and sports disciplines over the years, leading to increased vigilance and implementation of more stringent anti-doping regulations. While doping in sports involves science and technology in the form of the testing methods and the development of performance-enhancing substances, these aspects are secondary in this particular context. The primary focus of the article is the impact of doping on sports competitions and the consequences faced by an athlete found guilty of using prohibited substances.

Options: - spring into action - accept his fate - cross street - feel upset - travel to europe. Explanation:","response":"\\"Spring into action\\" is the correct answer to the question because it best corresponds to the situation described. Here's a step-by-step justification: 1. The person knew what he had to do to achieve his dreams: This statement implies that the person has a clear goal in mind and understands the steps required to achieve it. 2. So, what did he do?: This question asks for the most logical and appropriate action that the person took in response to having the knowledge of what they need to do. Now let's analyze the options: - Spring into action: This phrase means to suddenly begin working or doing something, often with enthusiasm. Given that the person knows what to do, it is the most suitable and natural response for them to promptly start working towards their dreams. - Accept his fate: This option implies passivity and resignation. It doesn't fit in the context of someone who knows what to do to achieve their dreams. - Cross street: This is an unrelated action and bears no relevance to the given situation. - Feel upset: Feeling upset is an emotional response and doesn't demonstrate whether the person would take any action to achieve their dreams. - Travel to Europe: This option could be relevant only if the person's dreams specifically required traveling to Europe. However, there is not enough context to support this being the correct answer. Considering the situation described and analyzing the options, \\"spring into action\\" is the appropriate response as it directly aligns with the individual's knowledge and intent to achieve their dreams."},{"question":"While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults. During the Punic crisis, popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber, the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman Bacchus. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; Liber's festival continued. With loyalty a necessity, what censorship did not need to be enforced?","response":"With loyalty being a necessity, censorship related to divine hierarchy did not need to be enforced. This is because, in the context provided, people were loyal to the ruling power, and their allegiance was to the various gods and goddesses regardless of their political or social standing. Since loyalty was implicit among the populace, the need to enforce a specific religious hierarchy was not as important. The continuation of Liber's festival highlights that even without political enforcement, religious cults and practices could coexist without causing disruption or requiring censorship."},{"question":"Paragraph: After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000.

In the Lahti area they surrendered on 1-2 May. The long Red caravans included women and children, who experienced a desperate, chaotic escape with severe losses due to White attacks.

Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. But I can use this background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. What is an answer for this question: Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae?

The text starts by listing negative aspects of the movie: bad acting, lack of plot, and poor camerawork. Justification: Listing negative aspects implies a negative sentiment. 2. The text then mentions \\"absolutely brilliant moments\\" in the movie that keep the viewer hoping for more. Justification: Mentioning positive aspects can indicate a mixed sentiment, but it's important to consider if the positive elements outweigh the negatives. 3. The phrase \\"it's too little, too late\\" suggests that the positive moments are not enough to save the movie. Justification: Using phrases that carry negative implications shows a negative sentiment. 4. The text mentions that if someone enjoys specific elements, they may not want to miss this movie. However, the author doesn't appreciate those elements, resulting in a \\"pretty horrible time.\\" Justification: Acknowledging that some people may like it indicates a mixed sentiment, but the author's negative experience reaffirms the negative sentiment. 5. The mention of \\"a few absolutely brilliant jokes\\" implies that not everything is bad in the movie, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of it. Justification: Stating a few positive aspects may indicate a mixed sentiment, but it reinforces that the negatives overshadow the positives. 6. Finally, the verdict of 4/10 and the statement \\"guilty of wasting my time\\" clearly show the author's negative sentiment towards the movie. Justification: Providing a low rating and negative conclusion reinforces the negative sentiment.

Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon. Hint: All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire.","response":"The smaller balloon has higher air pressure. Since the particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure, and both balloons are filled with the same gas, the smaller balloon has less volume for the gas particles, leading to more collisions and thus higher pressure compared to the larger balloon."},{"question":"Q: Is this product review positive?

The Real Madrid striker has now scored 200 league goals in 178 games; has netted more hat-tricks, 23 in the league, than any player in La Liga history; and is on a run of scoring in his last 17 home league matches. He is now scoring at a rate nearly two goals a game in the league – 23 in 13 matches. It would be churlish to dwell to long on the nature of the first goal but a dive is a dive even when it’s Ronaldo. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's big match stats: Real Madrid 3-0 Celta Vigo. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his clinical hat-trick that sent records tumbling during a 3-0 victory at the Bernabeu. The 29-year-old forward celebrates with team-mates Sergio Ramos (left), Karim Benzema, Dani Carvajal and Gareth Bale (right) Ronaldo took to Instagram after the game to celebrate his hat-trick with Real Madrid team-mate Pepe (right) Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Rodriguez (Arbeloa 53mins), Illarramendi, Kroos; Bale, Benzema (Coentrao 81'), Ronaldo (Hernandez 85') Booked: Rodriguez, Carvajal, Arbeloa, Illarramendi. Goals: Ronaldo (pen) 36' 65' 81' Celta Vigo: Sergio; Mallo, Cabral (Gomez 74'), Fontas, Jonny; Radoja, Hernandez, Krohn-Dehli (Mina 82'); Orellana (Fernandez 69'), Nolito, Larrivey. Booked: Cabral, Jonny, Nolito, Hernandez. Full-back Jonny Castro applied the slightest of touches to Ronaldo’s back as they both chased a Marcelo cross. There was no push from the defender but as the ball went beyond Ronaldo he dropped to the turf and referee Alberto Undiano pointed to the spot.The full-back was booked, as was forward Nolito, as Celta players surrounded the referee. Ronaldo coolly dispatched the spot-kick. It was his seventh penalty of the season. The only other player to score as many spot-kicks at this stage of the campaign was current Southampton manager Ronald Koeman in his Barcelona days. His first goal might have been unjust but it was only fair that Real went in at half time with the advantage having dominated the first 45 minutes. Celta Vigo had named the same team that beat Barcelona 1-0 a month ago but were under pressure from the start. Real should have taken the lead when Ronaldo headed goalwards, Celta Vigo keeper Sergio Alvarez pushed the ball out to Ramos, and he blasted wide from four yards out. Then Ronaldo had the ball taken off of his toe by full-back Jonny just as he was going to convert James Rodriguez’ cross and Gareth Bale joined the fun cutting in from the right but shooting straight at Alvarez. Ronaldo then bicycle-kicked onto the roof of the net with what would have been a sensational way to break the deadlock even by his standards. Alvarez pushed a Ronaldo shot around the post after the forward ran onto a long ball forward from Marcelo, and the keeper then held a shot from Rodriguez after he’d connected with a Ronaldo cross.

Real Madrid forward Ronaldo attempts an audacious bicycle kick during the first half against Celta Vigo. But Ronaldo's acrobatic effort just whistled over the bar of the away side at the Bernabeu on Saturday night.

The 29-year-old Portuguese forward celebrates his opening strike with Welsh team-mate Bale (right) VIDEO Having Ronaldo is a bonus after bicentennial goal - Ancelotti. Just as it seemed Celta might reach half-time unscathed Undiano pointed to the spot after Jonny touched Ronaldo and the striker broke the deadlock. He got his second goal on 64 minutes after a wall-pass with Toni Kross and fine finish past Alvaraz. Ten minutes from time he completed his hat-trick with a left-foot finish from Marcelo’s cross. He hobbled off with five minutes left with an ankle knock and Rodriguez also went down with a calf injury and was immediately replaced by Arbeloa. Madrid will now wait anxiously for test results on both players – they are already without Luka Modric for the next two and a half months. Only injuries can derail this Ronaldo-inspired Madrid team. If they win in the week against Ludogorets in the Champions League and against Almeria next weekend they will go to the World Club Championship having won their last 20 matches. Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez went down injured early in the second half before being substituted. Real forward Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his second of the evening in what turned into a conclusive win at the Bernabeu. And he celebrated his hat-trick with team-mate Marcelo before being substituted in the closing stages of the match.

Yes. I have something to tell. We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit. Later in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY.

He was known for his slapstick humor in film, television, stage and radio and was nicknamed the \\"King of Comedy\\". Lewis was one-half of the hit popular comedy duo Martin and Lewis with singer Dean Martin from 1946 to 1956. Context: Lewis kept a low political profile for many years, having taken advice reportedly given to him by President John F. Kennedy, who told him \\"Don't get into anything political. Don't do that because they will usurp your energy\\". Nevertheless, he campaigned and performed on behalf of both JFK and Robert F. Kennedy. Lewis was a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. For his 1957 NBC special, Lewis held his ground when southern affiliates objected to his stated friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. In a 1971 Movie Mirror magazine article, Lewis came out against the Vietnam War, when his son, Gary, returned from service traumatized. He vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons. Lewis once stated political speeches should not be at the Oscars. \\"I think we are the most dedicated industry in the world. And I think that we have to present ourselves that night as hard-working, caring and important people to the industry. We need to get more self-respect as an industry\\". In a 2004 interview with The Guardian, Lewis was asked what he was least proud of, to which he answered, \\"Politics\\". Not his politics, but the world's politics - the madness, the destruction, the general lack of respect. He lamented citizens' lack of pride in their country, stating, \\"President Bush is my president. I will not say anything negative about the president of the United States. I don't do that. And I don't allow my children to do that. Likewise when I come to England don't you do any jokes about 'Mum' to me. That is the Queen of England, you moron.\\" \\"Do you know how tough a job it is to be the Queen of England?\\" In a December 2015 interview on EWTN's World Over with Raymond Arroyo, Lewis expressed opposition to the United States letting in Syrian refugees, saying \\"No one has worked harder for the human condition than I have, but they're not part of the human condition if 11 guys in that group of 10,000 are ISIS. How can I take that chance?\\" In the same interview, he criticized President Barack Obama for not being prepared for ISIS, while expressing support for Donald Trump, saying he would make a good president because he was a good \\"showman\\". He also added that he admired Ronald Reagan's presidency. Question: What prompted him to take this stand? Answer:","response":"Jerry Lewis took his various political stands based on his personal experiences, values, and beliefs. Some major factors that prompted him to take these positions include: 1. Advice from President John F. Kennedy: JFK reportedly advised Lewis to avoid getting into anything political, as it could usurp his energy. This advice may have initially influenced Lewis to keep a low political profile. 2. Support for civil rights and friendships with African-American entertainers like Sammy Davis Jr.: Lewis was a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, and his friendships with African-American contemporaries influenced him to take a stand on racial equality in his career and personal life. 3. His son's experience in the Vietnam War: When Lewis' son returned from service traumatized, he publicly opposed the war and vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons. This deeply personal experience influenced his stance on the war. 4. Belief in respect for authority: Lewis expressed respect for the positions of leaders such as President Bush and the Queen of England, reinforcing his belief in maintaining respect for authority figures. 5. Concern for national security: In the context of Syrian refugees, Lewis was concerned about the potential for terrorist infiltration and the safety of American citizens. This prompted his opposition to letting in Syrian refugees. 6. Admiration for certain political figures: Lewis expressed support for Donald Trump and admired Ronald Reagan's presidency, possibly due to their backgrounds in entertainment and their \\"showmanship.\\" Overall, Jerry Lewis' various political stances were prompted by a combination of personal experiences, values, beliefs, and the influence of people in his life."},{"question":"Given the question: Article: In London, there has always been a main problem.

This tweet shows he's still openly mocking mainstream climate change science, even without directly questioning it. President Trump mocked the idea of global warming in a tweet Thursday, making one of his first (if not the first) such public comments on the topic since entering the White House almost a year ago. Fast facts: Most scientists agree human activity, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels, has been the primary contributor to Earth's aggregate temperature going up this past century. That does not mean, though, that freezing cold weather, like the East Coast is experiencing right now, won't happen in the future in many parts of the world. Climate change science is much more complicated than that, but citing cold weather is still a favorite line of politicians and others who doubt climate change is happening. Sen. James Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma, threw a snowball on the Senate floor in February 2015 to mock global warming. One level deeper: Trump's tweet was also mocking the Paris climate deal, a global accord virtually every country in the world except the United States supports. It calls on countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but as it stands the commitments wouldn't cut emissions to the levels most scientists say is needed. America's commitment under President Obama was actually relatively moderate -- up to 28% cut in such emissions by 2025 based on 2005 levels, but the Trump administration pointed to conservative groups' studies showing it could cripple the U.S. industrial economy while other countries, notably China, were called on to do less. Between the lines: The Trump administration released without political influence a statutorily required report earlier this year confirming in great depth that human activity is driving climate change. Trump's tweets get a lot of attention, but make sure to also watch what the administration does or doesn't do on this issue. The bottom line: Words matter, and so do the president's tweets. His perspective on this issue is influencing his most ardent followers, a new poll suggests. A survey released in October from George Mason University found that just 21% of conservative Republicans think global warming is mostly human-caused, a decrease of nine points since earlier this year. The semantics around climate change, or global warming, are almost as divisive as the science itself. Global warming was the default term up until the last decade or so, when climate change became more popular among those urging action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. That shift was partly to respond to comments like Trump made Thursday by clarifying that a higher global aggregate temperature does not mean the entire planet would be getting universally warmer. ||||| U.S. reconnaissance satellites have spotted Chinese ships selling oil to North Korean vessels on the West Sea around 30 times since October. According to South Korean government sources, the satellites have pictured large Chinese and North Korean ships illegally trading in oil in a part of the West Sea closer to China than South Korea. The satellite pictures even show the names of the ships. A government source said, \\"We need to focus on the fact that the illicit trade started after a UN Security Council resolution in September drastically capped North Korea's imports of refined petroleum products.\\" The U.S. Treasury Department placed six North Korean shipping and trading companies and 20 of their ships on sanctions list on Nov. 21, when it published spy satellite images taken on Oct. 19 showing a ship named Ryesonggang 1 connected to a Chinese vessel. |||||","response":"President Trump recently mocked the concept of global warming in a tweet, highlighting his continued skepticism towards mainstream climate change science. This marks one of his first public comments on the subject since entering the White House. The majority of scientists agree that human activity, predominantly from burning fossil fuels, has been the primary cause of the rise in Earth's aggregate temperature during the past century. However, this does not rule out the occurrence of cold weather events similar to the one currently experienced by the US East Coast. Trump's tweet further criticizes the Paris climate agreement, which the US, under his administration, has refused to support. During Trump's time as President, his administration published a report that detailed how human activity is indeed the driving force behind climate change. While his tweets receive ample attention, it is crucial to observe how the administration handles the climate change issue through policy decisions. The effects of Trump's viewpoint on global warming cannot be underestimated, as it influences his supporters. A George Mason University poll found that only 21% of conservative Republicans believe global warming is predominantly human-caused, a decline of nine points from earlier in 2017. The terms \\"climate change\\" and \\"global warming\\" have become almost as divisive as the science itself. Although \\"global warming\\" was the default phrase in the past, \\"climate change\\" has become more prevalent amongst those advocating for greenhouse gas emission cuts. This terminological change aims to clarify that a higher global aggregate temperature does not necessarily mean uniform warming across the entire planet."},{"question":"Are there moderators moderating the Quora moderators?

If you say things to either get your way or to please others, pretty soon people will catch on. Get to know your thoughts and feelings and communicate them to others in a respectful way. Make your actions and words match. If you're going to be late or miss something, let the person know. Don't say you'll maybe be there if you can't make it. Be honest and genuine about your wants, likes, and dislikes and communicate them. For example, don't say you want to eat Chinese food to please your friend, then complain about not eating what you want. If you back out of plans last minute, chances are people won't trust you to do things or won't feel like they can count on you. If you say you'll be somewhere, be there. If you say you'll help your friend, help your friend. Once people see you as reliable, they will begin to trust you and count on you. For example, if someone proposes plans, try not to waver on them too long. You might fear committing to plans, but show that you're reliable and say either yes or no. . Respect goes a long way in building and maintaining trusting friendships. Treat people with dignity and as equals to yourself. How you treat others shows the kind of person you are and whether you're deserving of people's trust. For example, listen when people speak without speaking over them. Don't make everything about you. If you're known as a gossip or someone who spreads rumors, chances are nobody will trust you. Drop this habit and learn to speak to people and about people differently. If you're not sure about something, ask the person directly instead of spreading a rumor. People want to know that you will treat them well and not say mean things about them to others. People notice when you look out for other people and offer to help. Treat people you know and don't know with kindness. Be polite and show up for your friends when they need you. For example, ask a friend if they need help moving or if they need a hug after a difficult day. Being a friend to someone who's in need can show that you're a worthwhile and trustworthy friend. Being vulnerable is an important part of friendship. By telling your friends your secrets, insecurities, and deepest thoughts, you are showing them that you trust them. In return, they may share their most intimate thoughts with you. It can be hard to open up at first. Start small. Talk about things that are important to you. When the time is right, share more about yourself. It is important that you do not judge or laugh at your friends when they open up to you. Good friends are nonjudgmental when their friend shares something important to them. Summary:","response":"To build trust, be honest and genuine in your communication, making sure your actions and words match. Be punctual and reliable, demonstrating your commitment to plans and promises. Treat others with respect and dignity, listen to them without interrupting, and avoid gossiping or spreading rumors.

The long, cold winter is over. The weather is warmer and sunnier. The trees again have leaves and the flowers are blooming. The season represents hope, joy and beauty. At this time, many people think of this classical music piece -- Spring, which shows happiness. Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi wrote it in the seventeen hundred. However, not all songs about spring are happy. This song written and sung by K.D. Lang is about dreaming of spring in cold dark places. She recorded I Dream of Spring in 2008. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein wrote It Might as Well Be Spring for the movie State Fair in 1945. Frank Sinatra sings it. It is a feeling of restlessness or excitement brought on by the coming of spring. Richard Rodgers also wrote Spring Is Here, this time with Lorenz Hart. Ella Fitzgerald sings this song about feeling lonely during this season. Frank Loesser wrote the sad song, Spring Will be a Little Late This Year. Why has the season been delayed? Because the singer's lover has left her. Sarah Vaughn released her version of the song in 1953. By now you may be thinking, \\"Enough with the sad songs, already!\\" Ok, then how about a cowboy song? Gene Autry was one of America's most famous singing cowboys. He recorded When It's Springtime in the Rockies in 1937. And finally, we'll leave you with a sunny song called Up Jumped Spring.

Begin play with a center pass. Score a goal. Follow the major and minor rules of the game to avoid penalties. Play netball for 4 quarters, each 15 minutes long. Win the game.","response":"Title: Understanding the Basics of Netball: From Coin Toss to Victory Introduction Netball, which originated in England in the early 1900s, is a fast-paced, team-oriented sport that is played by millions around the world. It is comparable to basketball in some ways, but with distinct differences in rules and gameplay. Players must work together in structured positions to score goals, with each game consisting of four quarters, each 15 minutes long. Step One: The Coin Toss The match begins with a coin toss, similar to other team sports like football and rugby. The team captain usually takes the responsibility of calling the toss, with the winner choosing which end of the court they wish to defend in the first half or whether they have the first center pass. Step Two: Center Pass The center pass is the manner of starting play in netball. The team that wins the coin toss takes the first center pass. The player in the center position takes it from the center circle, while their teammates stand in designated areas. The opposing center must also be inside the circle, three feet away from the player taking the pass. Once the umpire blows the whistle, the center is free to pass the ball to a teammate to continue the play. Step Three: Scoring a Goal The objective of netball is to outscore the opposition by successfully shooting the ball through the opponents' goal ring. Only goal shooters and goal attacks are allowed to score goals, and they must do so from within the goal circle. Each successful goal scores one point for the team. Teamwork, precise passing, and good positioning are crucial for creating scoring opportunities. Step Four: Adhering to Major and Minor Rules Netball has specific rules players must adhere to in order to avoid penalties. Major infringements include contact, obstruction, and stepping. These can result in the other team regaining possession or being awarded penalty passes or penalty shots. On the other hand, minor infringements, such as footwork and held ball, might not necessarily result in a change of possession. Step Five: Playing for Four Quarters Netball matches consist of four quarters, with each one lasting 15 minutes. Teams switch ends at the start of each quarter, which ensures that both teams experience the same environmental conditions during the match. There is also a short break between each quarter, which allows players to rest and strategize for the next period. Step Six: Winning the Game The team with the highest score at the end of the four quarters is declared the winner. If there is a tie, extra time might be played to determine the winner based on the specific competition's rules. Conclusion Netball is an exhilarating and strategic team sport, which demands physical fitness, coordination, and teamwork. Understanding the basics of the game, from the coin toss to scoring and adhering to various gameplay rules, is essential for participating in and enjoying the sport. So, gather your teammates, practice your passes and shots, and set your sights on victory."},{"question":"First question: What is the most lovely conversation you ever had with your spouse?

The Democratic presidential candidate and his wife took a break from the campaign trail to catch the evening performance of “Hamilton,” Broadway’s patriotic musical with a cult following. The Sanderses paid 167 each for two house seats at the Richard Rodgers Theater. While the hit show is sold out for the foreseeable future, the theater reserves a small number of seats for dignitaries and the cast members’ families,the New York Times reported.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the water is boiled for a long enough time happens, how will it affect the salt will not separate from the water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"In the process described, saltwater undergoes desalination to make it safe for drinking. The steps are as follows: 1. Saltwater is contained in a factory or plant. 2. The water is boiled to a very high temperature. 3. The salt becomes separated from the water. 4. The salt is removed. 5. The water is able to be drank at this point. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the water is boiled for a long enough time, the salt will not separate from the water. To address this hypothesis, let's first understand the process of boiling in more detail. During boiling, the water is heated to its boiling point (100°C or 212°F), where it turns into water vapor (steam). Since the boiling point of salt (sodium chloride) is much higher (approximately 801°C or 1474°F), it does not evaporate along with the water. As a result, when the water vapor cools and condenses back into liquid water, it leaves the salt behind, effectively separating the two. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis, even if the water is boiled for a long time, the salt will still remain in its solid form, unable to evaporate at the boiling temperature of water. Therefore, the salt will still separate from the water during the boiling process. Prolonging the boiling time does not have a direct or indirect effect on the separation of salt from the water. In fact, boiling the water for longer might only lead to a complete evaporation of the water, leaving only the salt behind."},{"question":"Translate \\"♦ Jay Nichols es el editor de la revista Fly Fisherman y vive en New Cumberland, Pennsylvania.\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"Jay Nichols is the editor of the Fly Fisherman magazine and lives in New Cumberland, Pennsylvania.

Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract. Abstract: To determine the relative contributions of the atrial and ventricular septa to total cardiac septation in patients with atrioventricular (AV) canal defect, two-dimensional echocardiography was used to measure the length of each portion of the septum in 14 patients with partial AV canal and 13 patients with the complete form of this lesion. Results were compared with similar data from 30 normal children, 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect. In patients with partial AV canal, the portion of total cardiac length occupied by the atrial septum did not differ from normal (24.8 +/- 9.9% versus 28.7 +/- 7.9%, p greater than 0.05), but there was a deficiency of both AV and ventricular septal tissue, the latter occupying only 48.2 +/- 7.0% of total cardiac length (versus 57.9 +/- 4.1% in normal subjects, p less than 0.05). Similarly, patients with complete AV canal had a normal amount of atrial septal tissue, a deficiency of AV septal tissue and a deficiency of ventricular septal tissue which was even greater than that of patients with a partial defect (39.4 +/- 5.0% versus 48.2 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.05). Thus, although partial AV canal defect is often called ostium primum atrial septal defect, the amount of atrial tissue is usually normal, the defect being formed by a deficiency of AV and ventricular septal tissue. In the complete form of the lesion, the deficiency of ventricular septal tissue is greater.

Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world. About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria. The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles of silver. The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it. Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper. They are designed to be torn from the book. Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned. Ms. Dankovich, the inventor, says each page can treat up to 100 liters of water. She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book's pages. \\"The idea of classic texts--that's of interest maybe later.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is causing more marine pollution? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Answer:","response":"Given the information provided, Hilda is causing more marine pollution. She dumps excess fertilizer into the river connected to the Malegese Ocean, which ultimately leads to the ocean. This introduction of potentially hazardous chemicals into the water contributes to marine pollution.

ISLAMABAD — The Muslim cleric at the forefront of a campaign to prosecute a Christian girl for blasphemy has suddenly found himself at risk of facing the same charges, after one of his colleagues went to the authorities and accused him of falsifying evidence of burned holy papers. The surprise arrest might change the direction of a case that has brought the world’s attention to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws, which critics say are regularly used to exploit and intimidate minorities. And it bolstered the possibility of a speedy release for Rimsha Masih, the girl awaiting trial in prison on charges she burned Muslim sacred documents; her bail hearing is scheduled to resume Monday. The cleric, Mohammad Khalid Chisti, 30, who leads a mosque in the impoverished Mehr Jaffer neighborhood on Islamabad’s outskirts, was arrested by a contingent of police officers late Saturday, presented before a judicial magistrate Sunday morning, and taken into police custody for 14 days. Until his arrest, Mr. Chisti had cast himself as a holy man who was incensed at a desecration and had passionately exhorted local residents to protest and demand the harshest of punishments for the accused girl, who family members and police officials say is a developmentally disabled minor. The demonstrations sent hundreds of Christian families fleeing the neighborhood after threats were reported. Mr. Chisti, 30, said in an interview Friday that he had been appointed as a lead cleric in Mehr Jaffer almost 10 months ago. During a fiery sermon at Friday Prayer, he angrily defended himself and urged people from the neighborhood to stand by him. “As long as people are with me, no one can force me to leave this neighborhood,” he said in the sermon. He also said that several religious leaders were in contact with him, urging him to make peace with the neighborhood’s Christian residents. He denied that he was trying to provoke locals. Mehr Jaffer remained peaceful and no protests broke out Sunday after the arrest of Mr. Chisti, residents said. But there were signs of palpable anger as local residents said they were unhappy over the arrest of their religious leader. “After evening prayers today, around 200 people of the neighborhood committee sat down for deliberations,” said Mohammad Zaheer, a resident. “They have decided that they will show solidarity with Khalid Chisti and distance themselves from Zubair,” he said, referring to the man who has testified against the cleric. Mr. Chisti found his fortunes reversing late Saturday when Hafiz Mohammad Zubair, a muezzin, or prayer caller, at his mosque appeared before a magistrate and said that the cleric had added two pages of the Koran to a heap of burned pages of the Noorani Qaida, a holy text used to teach the Koran to children, that was seized from Ms. Masih. “I tried to stop him, but he said that this would strengthen our case,” Mr. Zubair was quoted by police officials as saying. No immediate reason was given for Mr. Zubair’s testimony. Such accusations about Mr. Chisti are not new, however; some neighbors had accused the cleric of being a troublemaker and of instigating locals as details of the case surfaced last month. But the kind of testimony given by Mr. Zubair is rare in incidents of accused blasphemy, where much of the details are murky or disputed, as people are generally afraid of inviting the wrath of religious figures and leaders who use their pulpits to whip up a storm of public anger, often leading to violent protests and riots. Indeed, even if charges are dropped against Ms. Masih, some neighbors believe she will never be safe. At times, even just the rumor of blasphemous acts in Pakistan have led to lynchings or other violence, particularly against minorities. Late last month, a group of influential Islamic clerics urged the police to investigate the charges against Ms. Masih and prosecute her accusers if the charges proved to be fabricated. On Sunday, Mr. Chisti was brought before a magistrate blindfolded and with his hands tied, surrounded by police officers and commandos. “I have done nothing wrong,” he said during brief comments to reporters. Summary:","response":"A Pakistani Muslim cleric, Mohammad Khalid Chisti, who campaigned to prosecute a Christian girl for blasphemy, has been arrested after being accused of falsifying evidence of burned holy papers. The arrest may change the direction of the case and bring attention to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws, which are often used to exploit and intimidate minorities. This development could lead to the girl, Rimsha Masih, being released from prison. Chisti had previously urged locals to demand harsh punishment for Masih, causing hundreds of Christian families to flee the neighborhood due to threats."},{"question":"Answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. Can you go water skiing on Venus?","response":"Step 1: Understand the context - To go water skiing, we require a body of water and appropriate environmental conditions. Step 2: Determine the presence of water on Venus - Venus is known to have a hot and harsh environment, with surface temperatures reaching up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius). It is also known for its extremely dense and toxic atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide with traces of nitrogen and sulfuric acid clouds. There is no known presence of liquid water on the surface of Venus. Step 3: Assess the environmental conditions - The extreme temperatures and highly toxic atmosphere on Venus are not conducive to water skiing or any human activity. Furthermore, the lack of a body of water makes it impossible to engage in water skiing. Conclusion: No, you cannot go water skiing on Venus due to the lack of liquid water and inhospitable environmental conditions."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: where does bramble leave for?

The deputies—who said they pulled the car over because of its dark window tint, but allegedly later admitted the windows were legal—asked her about the bag but didn't believe it was cotton candy. (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution notes Fincher and the driver allegedly had suspended licenses at the time.) A roadside field test said there was meth in the bag and Fincher was arrested and charged with meth trafficking and possession with intent to distribute. She couldn't pay her 1 million bond and stayed in jail for three months; in March 2017, Georgia Bureau of Investigation tests revealed there had been no meth in the bag. Four weeks later, charges were dropped, and now Fincher is suing over the whole ordeal, WMAZ reports. Her federal lawsuit names the county, the deputies, and Sirchie Acquisitions, the company that manufactures the roadside drug test. Fincher alleges the test has a history of false positives, and that the blue food coloring used in the cotton candy triggered one. She also alleges the deputies were not trained in administering the test or in identifying street drugs, and that they ultimately violated her civil rights as a result. The suit says Fincher's incarceration caused her to miss \\"several major life events,\\" including the birth of her twin grandsons, and that when her son brought the babies to the jail to meet her, he was arrested on an outstanding bench warrant. Shortly thereafter, the suit says that Fincher, \\"frustrated with her incarceration,\\" broke her hand on a concrete wall. (Krispy Kreme doughnut flakes have also been mistaken for meth.) Article:","response":"Title: Woman Sues Over False Meth Charge After Cotton Candy Mistaken for Drugs On New Year's Eve 2016, Dasha Fincher was pulled over by two Monroe County, Georgia, sheriff's deputies who initially claimed her vehicle had dark window tint. The officers proceeded to question Fincher about a bag of blue cotton candy in the car. Despite her insistence that the substance was simply a sweet treat, a roadside field test conducted by the deputies flagged the presence of methamphetamine. Consequently, Fincher was arrested and charged with meth trafficking and possession with intent to distribute. Fincher, who could not afford the 1 million bond, remained in jail for three months until more extensive tests by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in March 2017 revealed there was no meth in the bag. Four weeks later, the charges against her were dropped. Now, Fincher has filed a federal lawsuit against the county, the deputies, and Sirchie Acquisitions, the company that manufactures the roadside drug test that wrongfully identified the cotton candy as meth. In the suit, Fincher claims that the test is known to produce false positives and that the blue food coloring in the cotton candy triggered one such result. She further alleges that the officers were not adequately trained to properly administer the test or identify street drugs and that they violated her civil rights as a result. According to the lawsuit, Fincher's wrongful incarceration led her to miss several significant life events, including the birth of her twin grandsons. When her son brought the infants to the jail so she could meet them, he was arrested on an outstanding bench warrant. The emotional turmoil caused Fincher to strike a concrete wall in frustration, resulting in a broken hand.

The commission for the brand new house of Knightshayes Court was obtained from Sir John Heathcoat-Amory in 1867 and the foundation stone was laid in 1869. By 1874, the building was still incomplete, owing to ongoing difficulties with Heathcoat-Amory, who objected to many of Burges's designs on the grounds of cost and of style. Although work had begun on the interior, the turbulent relationship between architect and client led to Burges's sacking in 1874 and his replacement by John Dibblee Crace. Nevertheless, Knightshayes Court remains the only example of a medium-sized Burges country house, built in a standard Victorian arrangement. Early French Gothic in style, it follows a standard neo-Tudor plan of a large central block with projecting gables. The tower Burges planned was never built. The interior was to have been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.Since the house passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of restoration and re-creation have been undertaken and a number of pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.

Options are: a). No; b). Yes; Answer:","response":"a). No; The given statement, \\"Destination marketing organizations are often called travel, convention, visitors, or tourism bureaux, welcome centers, information centers, and more.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question, \\"how many cubes are in the US?\\" The question is asking for a count or a number of cubes in the US. It is unclear whether the question refers to a specific type of cube (e.g., Rubik's cubes, ice cubes, etc.) or is asking in a more general sense. Regardless, the information provided in the answer about destination marketing organizations is not relevant to any interpretation of the question. The response should address the topic of cubes in the US rather than discussing unrelated information. In order to provide a relevant answer to the question, one would need to first clarify what type of cube is being referred to. For example, if the question is about Rubik's cubes, one could attempt to research and estimate the number of Rubik's cubes in the United States, taking into consideration sales data, market penetration, and other factors. This research task would be difficult due to the nature of the information required. Similarly, if the question is about ice cubes, one could research data related to the production and consumption of ice by the US population or other ice-cube-related statistics. However, providing an exact number would still be a challenging task due to the wide range of data sources and variables involved. In conclusion, the provided answer is not relevant to the original question. A more appropriate response would address the topic of cubes in the US and attempt to provide an estimate based on the context and clarification of the type of cube being asked about."},{"question":"How does the next paragraph end?

Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Augustus \`\` Gussie '' Clarke ( born 1953 ) is a reggae producer who worked with some of the top Jamaican reggae artists in the 1970s and later set up his own Music Works studio . - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.

Simplify the equation by combining like terms. 2. Isolate the term containing k. 3. Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k (which is 64). Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms First, let's add and subtract the constant terms on the left-hand side of the equation: 64*k + (747 + 845 - 331) = -147 Now we can calculate the result of the addition and subtraction: 747 + 845 = 1592 1592 - 331 = 1261 So, the simplified equation becomes: 64*k + 1261 = -147 Step 2: Isolate the term containing k Now, let's isolate the term containing k by subtracting 1261 from both sides of the equation: 64*k + 1261 - 1261 = -147 - 1261 This simplifies to: 64*k = -1408 Step 3: Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k (64) Finally, we will solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by 64: 64*k / 64 = -1408 / 64 This simplifies to: k = -22 So the solution for the given equation is k = -22."},{"question":"Instructions: This task is about translating a given English language sentence to Spanish.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

The sandwich was for 4, and the juice was two times more expensive. The bottle of milk cost was 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice. How much did George pay for his food?. Explanation:","response":"George bought three items for his trip: a sandwich, a bottle of juice, and a bottle of milk. 1. The sandwich cost 4. 2.

He was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist whose groundbreaking work transformed the world of science and laid the groundwork for the modern theory of evolution. Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, England, on February 12, 1809. He came from a family of scientists and intellectuals, with both his father and grandfather being physicians. Darwin studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but soon realized his true passion was in natural history. He later enrolled at Christ's College, University of Cambridge, to study religion and become an Anglican clergyman. There, he was exposed to various thinkers who influenced his intellectual development, such as the reverend John Stevens Henslow, John Herschel, and Adam Sedgwick. In 1831, Darwin was invited to join the HMS Beagle as a naturalist for its five-year voyage around the world. This voyage dramatically expanded Darwin's knowledge of natural history and geology, providing him with ample evidence to build the foundation for his theory of evolution. During the voyage, he collected thousands of specimens while meticulously recording his observations and discoveries. The Galápagos Islands were particularly influential in shaping Darwin's perspective on evolution. He noticed that the plants and animals on these islands were similar to those he encountered on the mainland, but each island had distinct species that were finely adapted to their habitats. This prompted him to question the idea of a fixed, divinely created species and wonder about the factors that shaped these unique adaptations. Upon returning to England, Darwin began analyzing his specimens and synthesizing his ideas. He proposed a revolutionary theory: that species evolve over time and new species emerge through a process called natural selection. Natural selection states that certain individuals within a population have variations that provide them with a competitive edge, allowing them to survive, reproduce, and pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring. Over generations, these traits become more common in the population, resulting in a gradual change in the species. Darwin's ideas were further supported by his subsequent research, which included the study of plant and animal breeding, as well as the work of fellow scientists and thinkers such as Thomas Malthus, who provided insight into the role of population growth and limited resources in shaping natural selection. In 1859, Darwin published his seminal work, \\"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,\\" which outlined his theory of evolution and introduced the concept of natural selection to the scientific community. This book was highly controversial in Victorian-era England, as it challenged the predominant religious beliefs and existing scientific notions of the time. Nevertheless, the evidence presented by Darwin, along with the subsequent research and discoveries made by other scientists, firmly established the theory of evolution as a foundation of modern biology. In summary, Charles Darwin was a major figure in the evolutionary perspective, as he revolutionized our understanding of the natural world by proposing the theory of evolution and natural selection. His work laid the groundwork for our modern understanding of biology and the dynamic nature of life on Earth, making him one of the most influential figures in the history of science."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: By. Matt Blake. PUBLISHED:. 12:00 EST, 19 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 03:06 EST, 20 December 2012. Belgium is considering a significant change to its decade-old euthanasia law that would allow minors and Alzheimer’s sufferers to seek permission to die. The proposed changes to the law were submitted to parliament on Tuesday by the Socialist party and are likely to be approved by other parties, although no date has yet been put forward for a parliamentary debate. 'The idea is to update the law to take better account of dramatic situations and extremely harrowing cases we must find a response to,' party leader Thierry Giet said. Contentious: Belgium was the second country in the world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002 but it applies only to people over the age of 18 (picture posed by models) The draft legislation calls for 'the law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we cannot alleviate.' Belgium was the second country in the world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002 but it applies only to people over the age of 18. Socialist Senator Philippe Mahoux, who helped draft the proposed changes, said there had been cases of adolescents who 'had the capacity to decide' their future. Campaign: Tony Nicklinson, who suffered from locked-in syndrome, lost a legal battle for the right to be helped to end his life when he chooses earlier this year. He died at his Wiltshire home just days after the High Court judgement. He said parliamentarians would also consider extended mercy-killing to people suffering from Alzheiner’s-type illnesses. Euthanasia was allowed to an Alzheimer’s patient for the first time in the Netherlands last year. In Belgium, some 1,133 cases -- mostly for terminal cancer -- were recorded in 2011, about one percent of all deaths in the country, according to official figures.

To fill the room, you’ll want to wait at least 10 minutes so the steam has time to build. Once there is plenty of steam in the bathroom, you can set the page down so the steam can help relax its fibers. Make sure that it’s not too close to the shower, though, because you don’t want any moisture to develop on the paper. Check that it isn’t folded or creased in any areas either. Wherever you plan to set the paper down, it’s a good idea to lay down a clean towel first. It will absorb any moisture that might be on the surface from the steam, so you don’t have to worry about the paper getting too wet. In order for the steam to help the paper release the wrinkles, you’ll need to keep it in the bathroom for approximately 10 minutes. If the page is severely wrinkled, you may want to give it extra time -- but check on it every so often to ensure that it’s not absorbing too much moisture. After the paper has been steamed, remove it from the bathroom, and place it on another flat surface. While the steam may have helped release some of the wrinkles, you should use your hand to press over it again while the paper is still relaxed from the steam. Be gentle, though, because you don’t want to tear or damage the page. You may want to cover your hand in a clean hand towel before smoothing the paper. That will help protect it from any dirt, oils, or other debris that might be on your skin. Even if you manage to smooth most of the wrinkles out of the paper, you may want to place the paper under a heavy weight for several hours to a day in order to further press it. Summary:","response":"The text describes a method of using steam to relax the fibers of a piece of paper, potentially removing wrinkles and creases. The process begins with running a hot shower in a closed bathroom, generating steam. After a buildup of about 10 minutes, the paper can be placed in the steamy room on a towel to absorb any surface moisture. The distance from the shower should be enough to avoid any moisture from developing on the paper. It is also advised to ensure the paper is not folded or creased. Following an approximate 10-minute exposure to the steam (possibly longer for heavily wrinkled paper), the paper should be frequently checked so it doesn't absorb too much moisture. Post-steam treatment, the paper should be gently pressed while it is still relaxed from the steam, preferably with a clean hand towel, to prevent any damage or tear. Finally, for the best results, the paper should be placed under a heavy weight for several hours to a day.

Nelson went out to thank fans who gathered at the home to mourn the loss... (Associated Press) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minnesota judge appointed a corporate trust company on Wednesday to temporarily oversee Prince's multimillion-dollar estate, saying the emergency appointment was necessary because the superstar musician doesn't appear to have a will and immediate decisions must be made about his business interests. Judge Kevin Eide granted a request from Prince's sister to appoint Bremer Trust as special administrator, giving the company authority to manage and supervise Prince's assets and identify his heirs. Eide said Prince had no appointed personal representative but had substantial assets and owned businesses that require immediate attention and ongoing management. The judge also noted that identities and addresses of Prince's heirs need to be determined. Prince's only full sibling, Tyka Nelson, requested the move Tuesday, telling the court she believed her brother didn't have a will. Prince also has five surviving half-siblings who could share in the estate. Eide wrote that Prince died \\"intestate,\\" meaning he did not have a valid will, and said there was no pending application or petition for probate of a will in any court. However, someone could still come forward with a will or trust document, which happened after Michael Jackson died in June 2009. Jackson's longtime lawyer John Branca filed a will six days after his death, upending moves by Jackson's mother to become his estate's executor based on her assumption there wasn't a will. For now, Bremer Trust will act as special administrator for six months or until a personal representative is appointed, whichever is less. Later Wednesday, the estate already had its first claim against it, with a filing from a California man who claimed that Prince had transferred ownership of his music catalog to him in 1995. Prince, 57, died last week at Paisley Park, his famous home and recording studio complex in suburban Minneapolis. His cause of death hasn't been released. An autopsy was conducted Friday, but results aren't expected to be released for weeks. The value of his estate isn't known. Prince made hundreds of millions of dollars for record companies, concert venues and others, and the outpouring of grief and nostalgia after his death prompted fans to buy 2.3 million of his songs in just three days. Prince also owned a dozen properties in Minnesota, most of it undeveloped land and some houses for relatives, worth about 27 million, according to public records. He also sold more than 100 million albums, and concert industry magazine Pollstar reported that in the years Prince's tours topped the charts — 10 years over four decades performing — they raked in 225 million in ticket sales. But it's not clear how much money Prince had when he died, given that he had to pay record labels and staff and cover other expenses. On Wednesday, Eide said Bremer Trust was in the best position to handle Prince's estate. The judge noted that its affiliate, Bremer Bank, had worked with Prince and has knowledge of his personal and business finances. The judge said Nelson and one of Prince's half-brothers, Omarr Baker, were part of the telephone conference that prompted his decision Wednesday. The judge said no one objected to appointing a special administrator. Under Minnesota law, if a person dies without a will — and with no surviving parents, children, or grandchildren — the next people in line to share in the estate are the surviving siblings, including half-siblings.

The owners will re-evaluate the policy, which dates back to 1973, after the blackout-free season. Under the policy, NFL games were blacked out on local television unless the game was sold out 72 hours in advance. However, the league often extend the deadline to 48 or even 24 hours ahead of the game if only a few thousand tickets needed to be sold. In 2012, the league amended its blackout policy for most teams, saying teams needed only to sell 85 percent of the available tickets to avoid a blackout. Four teams — the Bills, Browns, Colts and Chargers — elected to stick with the old policy. Last year, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler wrote an op-ed in USA Today saying that blackout rules were obsolete and needed to be abolished: The sports blackout rules are a bad hangover from the days when barely 40 percent of games sold out and gate receipts were the league’s principal source of revenue. Last weekend, every single game was sold out. More significantly, pro football is now the most popular content on television. NFL games dominated last week’s ratings, as usual, and the Super Bowl has effectively become a national holiday. With the NFL’s incredible popularity, it’s not surprising that last year the League made 10 billion in revenue and only two games were blacked-out. But the NFL’s blackout policy remains a real concern for fans. During last year’s playoffs, Cincinnati, Green Bay and Indianapolis hadn’t sold out their games 72 hours before kickoff. The only way those games weren’t denied to fans was that local businesses bought blocks of tickets just so the game could be officially “sold out.” The most egregious case was in Green Bay, where the weather forecast called for a low of minus-15 degrees. Despite decades of unbelievable fan support and loyalty – Green Bay had sold out every regular season game since 1959 – local Packer fans were effectively told that if more people didn’t buy tickets to go freeze, the rest of the community wouldn’t be able to watch the game on TV. Today, we are blowing the whistle on this anti-fan practice. The NFL should no longer be able to hide behind government rules that punish loyal fans, which is why I am sending to my fellow commissioners a proposal to get rid of the FCC’s blackout rules once and for all. It fulfills a commitment I made in June. We will vote on the proposal on September 30. That may have had some impact on the owners’ vote Monday. Sources mentioned the lack of blackouts last year when discussing owners' reasoning. FCC thoughts also played part. — Kevin Clark (@KevinClarkWSJ) March 23, 2015 After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014.

There is too much sameness of tone, pace and content. A:","response":"The given review seems to highlight both positive and negative aspects of the product, which in this case is a CD by an artist named Williams. Based on the review, it appears as though the person was drawn to the product due to positive reviews they encountered on Amazon from both professionals and customers. This aspect, in and of itself, might increase the chances of purchasing the product, as it suggests that others have found value in it. However, when evaluating the content of the review, there are several aspects that might decrease the likelihood of purchasing the product. The reviewer mentions that Williams' voice is monotonous, and her delivery is described as having a deadpan quality, which they found to be grating. Additionally, the reviewer points out that there is too much sameness in tone, pace, and content throughout the CD. These negative aspects could potentially outweigh the positive reviews from other sources and might make it less appealing for someone considering whether to purchase the product or not. The review also highlights a positive aspect of the product, which is its lyricism. The reviewer found the lyrics to be interesting and full of sensory imagery. This detail might be attractive to those who appreciate the quality of lyrics in the music they prefer to listen to. Taking all these points into consideration, it seems that this review would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product. While the positive aspect of lyricism might appeal to some, the negatives presented—monotonous voice, deadpan delivery, and sameness in tone, pace, and content—seem to be more impactful and significant factors that could affect the overall enjoyment of the product. Furthermore, the fact that the reviewer implicitly trusted the positive reviews on Amazon, only to be disappointed by the product, might cause potential buyers to question the reliability of those positive reviews. Ultimately, a potential buyer might decide that although some aspects of the product are attractive, it may not be suitable for them based on the described negative elements.

It refers to the process of bringing the two covers of the book together, typically done after finishing reading or when wanting to store the book away. The reason behind the man's action of closing the book is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. However, there can be several possible explanations as to why the man might have closed the book. Here are a few potential reasons: 1. Completion of reading: The man might have finished reading the book and closed it to signify the end of his reading journey. It may also demonstrate a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction gained from completing the book. 2. Taking a break: The man could have decided to pause his reading for a while, possibly due to fatigue, distraction, or simply needing time to absorb and reflect upon the information or story he just read. 3. Interruptions: It's possible the man faced external interruptions such as a phone call, an unexpected visitor, or other external factors that required his immediate attention, forcing him to close the book momentarily or for an extended period. 4. Disinterest: The man could have lost interest in the book, finding the subject matter or writing style not engaging or captivating enough to continue. In this case, closing the book symbolizes the discontinuation of his reading experience. 5. Emotional impact: Some books can evoke strong emotions in the reader, leading them to close the book and take a moment to process those emotions. The story might have resonated with the man or provoked profound thoughts, prompting him to close the book and reflect on his feelings. 6. Time constraints: The man might have run out of time for reading and decided to close the book to attend to other priorities or commitments. 7. Respect and care: The man might have closed the book out of respect or care for the book (or the material it organizes), ensuring that the pages are protected from damage or wear and that it can be easily stored until the next reading session. Given just the sentence \\"The man closed the book,\\" we cannot definitively determine the precise cause, as we lack specific contextual information.

Traditional energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas have long been associated with harmful environmental consequences and the release of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Moreover, as our population grows and developing countries continue to seek economic growth, the demand for energy increases exponentially, making it increasingly important to find viable alternatives to our current sources of energy. In light of these challenges, researchers, governments, and businesses worldwide have been investing in the development of renewable energy technologies. Hypothesis: Implementing a diverse mix of renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and bioenergy, could significantly reduce our global reliance on fossil fuels, minimize environmental degradation, and support sustainable development and economic growth. As the world's energy demands continue to increase, diversified energy sources can help to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply and may mitigate the negative impacts of fluctuations in fuel prices and the availability of resources. In addition to creating a more resilient and reliable energy system, the widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies would have more direct benefits. Firstly, increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Solar, wind, and other renewable power sources largely produce far less carbon dioxide and other pollutants than conventional fossil fuels. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), transitioning to a renewable-based energy system could slash carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 70% by the year 2050. This could substantially contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. Secondly, the renewable energy sector has significant potential for creating employment opportunities. The global renewable energy sector employed approximately 11.5 million people in 2019, according to IRENA. As investments in renewable energy technologies continue to grow, so too will the number of jobs available in related fields. This could support economic growth, particularly in developing countries where access to energy is still limited. Thirdly, the decentralization of energy generation through renewable energy technologies can provide greater energy security and resilience. By diversifying energy sources, countries can minimize their reliance on imported fossil fuels, reducing the risks associated with geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions. Fourthly, the adoption of renewable energy technologies can foster innovation and drive technological advancements. As governments and businesses invest in renewable energy research and development, new technologies will continue to emerge, driving down the cost of production, increasing efficiency, and making renewable energy even more accessible. Finally, the development of renewable energy infrastructure can support local and regional economies, particularly in rural areas. By empowering communities to generate their own energy, renewable energy projects can boost local self-sufficiency and contribute to socio-economic development. In conclusion, the widespread implementation of diverse renewable energy technologies holds the potential to significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, while also addressing other pressing challenges such as climate change, poverty, and economic development. By investing in clean, sustainable energy alternatives, we can help to secure a brighter and more prosperous future for generations to come."},{"question":"britain denied wednesday any \`\` double-dealing '' with oil-rich libya over the release of the lockerbie bomber but admitted it had not wanted the former libyan agent to die in a scottish prison .

Lehiff is a petty criminal always involved in trouble. Lehiff's nemesis, Garda Detective Jerry Lynch presents himself as a saviour who fights the \\"scumbags\\" on Dublin's streets, and enlists the help of Ben Campion, an ambitious film-maker and the bane of his \\"go-softer\\" boss, who considers Lynch too nasty a subject to be shown on a mainstream âdocusoapâ series on Irish television.

Sally is deeply insecure about her looks. She grows bitter when Deirdre flaunts her new boyfriend, Sam, a middle-aged bank manager who has left his wife of 14 years, Noeleen, leaving her to question her own self-worth as a woman and wife.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but the focus of prospecting should not be making sales. Your focus must be on establishing a relationship with as many prospects as possible. Opening the relationship comes first. Once you make contact with a prospect, you need to convince him or her to schedule an appointment or listen to your sales pitch. Sales are important, of course, and you should go into each dialogue with the goal of selling your product or service. Even if you do not make the sale, though, you should still seek to keep the relationship open. That prospect may need your product or service later, and if you continue to touch base, he or she may think of you before contacting anyone else when the time comes. Prospects typically respond better when they feel they are being served rather than sold to. Feedback lets your prospects know that you are interested in their needs and wants. Stay engaged through social media. Post frequent updates to your blog and social media pages, and respond to inquiries and comments made through those sources. Send surveys. Prospects are generally more willing to respond to short surveys, but they may respond to a long survey if there is a reward or the chance of a reward at the end. For instance, filling out a survey may enter the prospect in a drawing for cash or a gift card. Regardless of the length, though, sending surveys sends the message that you want to know how you can improve to meet customer needs. Even if your prospect is actually a large company instead of an individual, you will probably speak with the same individual at the company each time you call or write. Establishing a positive relationship with your contact at the company is important. At minimum, you need to know his or her name and keep your conversations both friendly and professional. If necessary, take notes after each conversation with your contact so that you can pick up where you left off with the next call. The contact you establish a relationship with may not make the final decision, but he or she will have some input. Creating a favorable opinion with your initial contact will improve your chances of a receiving a positive recommendation. Once you've started a relationship with a prospect, you need to nurture that relationship so that it continues to grow. The idea is to eventually convert your prospects into loyal customers. Follow up with each prospect on a regular basis. Send \\"thank you\\" notes and e-mails. Pass along surveys and copies of your newsletter. Touch base with those who have bought from you in the past to find out how satisfied they are with your product or service.","response":"The primary focus of prospecting should be on establishing and nurturing relationships with as many prospects as possible, rather than solely making sales, as this approach can lead to more loyal customers and long-term business connections."},{"question":"Question: who's letter does jane find?

Vandals ironically daubed graffiti on a £650,000 Banksy mural - just hours before a wealthy philanthropist paid to stop the iconic artwork being removed.

But this week, vandals scratched a name into one of the spies' sunglasses, before messily scribbling it out. Vandals attacked one of Banksy's pieces of street art in Cheltenham by scribbling on one of the character's sunglasses - just hours before a millionaire stepped in to stop it being removed from the wall. The artwork featuring three spies, which is inspired by the town's GCHQ,. was painted on the side of a semi-detached house by the elusive artist. in April this year- and soon became the subject of an ownership war. Banksy made his name as an artist through his graffiti art, which he creates in secret, usually in public places. The vandalism came just hours before a millionaire stepped in to ensure the artwork stayed in place for the community. After the piece was created, the GCHQ-inspired artwork became the centre of an ownership war. Both the community and an art collector wanted to buy the piece from the homeowner. An art. collector offered to buy it from the homeowner and have it scraped off. the wall but the community wanted the painting to stay put. To abate the row, Cheltenham Borough Council issued a temporary notice to stop anyone undertaking any work to the listed property, which would include removing the painting. But. just hours before the notice ran out, Hekmat Kaveh stepped. in and offered the homeowner an undisclosed fee to leave the artwork in. place for the community. Mr. Kaveh said: 'Having spoken to many people over the last few weeks, and. reading many comments on social media, I have concluded that there is a. very strong feeling about this work. 'It. seems that Cheltenham generally is in support of, not only retaining. the Banksy in the town, but in its current location, where it was. clearly intended to be.'

Group leader Angela de Souza said: 'I am sure the whole town extend their gratitude to Mr Kaveh for stepping in like this to prevent the loss of this artwork.' The move is still subject to receiving agreement from council planners, listed building authorities, the Highways Agency and Cheltenham Borough Council - but most have already expressed support. Speaking about the vandalism, Cheltenham’s. own street artist Dice67 - who previously put a layer of protective paint over the. work to stop the piece being defaced - said: 'It’s never nice to see someone defacing street art.

Fact 2: Mirrors are plate glass. Given the two facts above, mirrors cause? Options: (1). heat energy (2). direct energy (3). depletion of light (4). inspection of light (5). flow of electrons (6). refraction of light (7). optical illusions (8). The area was once underwater The answer is:","response":"(6). refraction of light Reasoning: Given Fact 1: Glass causes refraction of light. Given Fact 2: Mirrors are plate glass. Given these two facts, we can deduce that mirrors also cause refraction of light. Refraction occurs when light waves pass through one medium to another and change direction due to the different speeds of light in the two media. Mirrors are made of plate glass that has a reflective coating (usually silver, aluminum, or other metals) applied to the back. When light enters the glass, some of it is refracted and continues through the glass medium. The majority of the light, however, gets reflected off the reflective coating, forming the mirror's image. The refraction of light in the mirror is not as obvious as in a transparent medium, such as water, due to the reflective coating behind the glass. However, since mirrors are made from plate glass, they still cause refraction of light, as indicated in Fact 1. The other options are incorrect because: (1). heat energy - Mirrors do not generate or cause heat energy themselves. They simply reflect and refract light. (2). direct energy - Mirrors do not create or distribute energy; they reflect and refract light. (3). depletion of light - Mirrors do not deplete light but reflect and refract it. (4). inspection of light - Mirrors do not inspect light but reflect and refract it. (5). flow of electrons - Mirrors do not influence the flow of electrons, as their operation is based on the reflection and refraction of light. (7). optical illusions - Optical illusions can be created using mirrors, but it is not the sole cause or purpose of mirrors. (8). The area was once underwater - This option is irrelevant to the given facts and the question posed about mirrors."},{"question":"April 1, 2006 Walter died today. Found out this morning over breakfast. Suicide. Walter. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

Here is a hypothesis: The surly face glared at them, but said nothing. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To determine if the hypothesis follows the premise, let's evaluate both of them step by step: Premise: She muttered into it, while a surly face stared out. In this statement, we have two events happening: 1. Someone (\\"she\\") is muttering into \\"it\\", presumably an object or device. 2. A surly face is staring out, which implies that there is a face (with a bad-tempered or unhappy expression) involved. Hypothesis: The surly face glared at them, but said nothing. In this statement, we also have two events happening: 1. The surly face is now glaring, possibly indicating a stronger negative emotion or reaction. 2. The surly face remains silent, not verbally responding to the situation. Now, let's compare the premise and hypothesis: From both statements, we can conclude that the surly face exists. However, the hypothesis introduces \\"them\\", which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. It is possible that the face is looking at \\"them\\", but it is not specified in the premise. Also, the emotional state has shifted from simply staring to glaring, which implies an escalation in the face's reaction, but again, this is not explicitly stated in the premise.

Murmuring sounds could be heard as they talked quietly. Women nervously performed their domestic tasks, preparing a small meal. Several sad, old men sat mute, their morale very low. The camp was pitched at the edge of a deep valley--so deep that one could barely see the calm water at the bottom. The Indians had been taken by surprise and were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces. They fought bravely, but they were degraded by defeat. Their homes were destroyed. Those who had survived had been pursued by the enemy. The chase had lasted for days. Persuaded by their leaders to press on, they had made a wrong turn. Their _ journey ended at the edge of a valley--a desperate situation. Before them was a great hole in the earth. Behind them was the enemy. No wonder they were frozen with fear. Where could they go? Just when no choice seemed available to them, several young braves ran into camp. With great excitement they reported seeing a stone bridge across the valley, just a short distance from camp. Most of the tribe discounted this wild story. However, a few hurried to the spot to see for themselves. Seeing was believing! Indeed there was a stone bridge, great enough to accommodate many people and their horses. Without hesitation the people gathered up their children and the belongings they had and hurried across the bridge. Enemy braves watched from a nearby cliff. It was obvious that the Great Spirit was on the side of the defeated. The enemy did not follow. Safe on the other side of the valley, the wanderers thanked the Great Spirit for providing the vital link. They had escaped their enemies. For hundreds of miles around, Indian people heard about the miraculous stone bridge. From this incident it was clear that the Great Spirit defends weak people. Many came from near and far to see the magnificent stone bridge. You, too, can see this bridge and even ride across it in a car--in southwestern Virginia. Question: Faced with the desperate situation, some Indians in the camp _ . Options: (A) tried to persuade their leaders to give in to the enemies. (B) were still as cheerful as before.

But how about a man out walking with an exotically-coloured macaw on an avian harness? That's the wild, winged sight that regularly greets locals in Londonderry, where Gerry McKeever and his pet parrot Rio take their daily walks. The pair are often spotted dandering along the Northland Road, near the Clarendon Street area, with Gerry leading Rio - and they're always happy to stop for a chat. The sight of one man and his parrot has been turning heads for months - when a video of Gerry and Rio was posted on the Mark Patterson Show Facebook page last year, most of the comments were along the lines of: \\"Look, that's the parrot we saw the other day!\\" But, while it may be an odd sight to see a man walking a blue-and-gold macaw, Gerry is simply making sure his feathered friend is getting the stimulation she needs. \\"Macaws usually come in pairs because they're such sociable animals,\\" he said. \\"But, we didn't have room for two and we don't have a large aviary or outdoor area or anything like that, so we have to get her out of the house and take her for walks. \\"Rio just loves it so we take her out two or three times a day.\\" He added: \\"She's actually like a dog, she gets excited when she sees the harness. \\"She now has her favourite sitting spots. She'll sit there and say hello to people, watch the world go by. They're creatures of habit too and she loves to talk - she says hello, tata, what's the craic.\\" While Rio likes a natter, she's not quite as talkative as the other parrot owned by Gerry and his wife Mandy - Charlie, an 11-year-old African Grey. According to Mandy, her and Gerry have always loved birds. \\"I've always had birds since I was a child,\\" she said. \\"We've had cockatoos, budgies but then we got Charlie and she's fantastic. \\"She stays in the house though, you couldn't put a harness on her now as you have to start them off when they're young.\\" Gerry credits Mandy as the one who takes care of Rio and Charlie when he's at work, and is also responsible for doing a lot of the research needed to keep the pair of them well-informed on parrot welfare. \\"She's my sweetheart,\\" says Mandy. \\"I do the feeding, the cleaning out. I just love them.\\" And the people of Derry have been taking Rio to their hearts too. Martina Donaghy tweeted the BBC on Tuesday morning with a picture of Gerry and Rio with the hashtags #brightenmymornings #thkUMr. \\"I see this man walking his parrot each morning & want to tell him thanks!\\" Gerry admits himself that he's now become \\"the man with the parrot\\". \\"Even when Rio's not with me, people would say that's who I am,\\" he laughs. He adds: \\"I got stopped a lot but people are more used to me now. Children still love to stop and say hello. \\"I've taken her up to the Model School (primary school) a couple of times, although I still don't let people get too close .They can stroke her tail, but she's still just a baby and can give a nasty bite. \\"She has to get used to people first so you still have to be careful. \\"But if she brightens people's day when they see her, that's great.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","response":"The article showcases how Gerry McKeever and his pet parrot Rio have become a unique sight in Londonderry as they take daily walks together, using an avian harness for the blue-and-gold macaw.

Question: suppose more people buy aluminum products happens, how will it affect more magma cools. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"The process of rocks forming from magma and eventually turning into different types of rocks like igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks is called the rock cycle. This process is powered by natural geological forces such as pressure, heat, and erosion. On the other hand, the purchasing of aluminum products by people is an economic activity that is largely unrelated to these geological processes. Aluminum is extracted from the Earth's crust through a process of mining and refining. The primary source of aluminum is the mineral bauxite, which itself is a type of sedimentary rock. The extraction and processing of bauxite involve surface mining, crushing, and the application of heat and chemical processes to obtain aluminum. It could be argued that increased demand for aluminum products could potentially lead to an increase in mining activities which may contribute to the breakdown of rocks over time. However, there is no direct link between the economic activity of purchasing more aluminum products and the geological process of magma cooling to form igneous rocks. The natural forces that lead to more magma cooling are heat loss, pressure decrease, and exposure to colder materials, such as when magma encounters colder rocks or emerges on the Earth's surface as volcanic eruptions. These processes occur independently of human consumption patterns of aluminum products. In summary, while increased aluminum production may have some indirect influence on the breakdown of rocks for mining purposes, there is no direct effect on magma cooling rates or the formation of igneous rocks. Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be C: no effect. The purchasing of more aluminum products does not have a direct impact on the cooling of magma or the formation of igneous rocks, as these processes are governed by natural geological forces that remain largely independent of human economic activities."},{"question":"In these two sentences (1) Trade fair.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November.

How many macaroons will remain if Fran ate 15 green macaroons and twice as many red macaroons as green macaroons?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"Sure, let's first find out how many red macaroons Fran ate. Since she ate twice as many red macaroons as green macaroons: Red macaroons eaten = 2 x (Green macaroons eaten) Red macaroons eaten = 2 x 15 Red macaroons eaten = 30 Now, let's find out how many macaroons remain. Initially, there were 50 red macaroons and 40 green macaroons, totaling 90 macaroons. Fran ate 30 red macaroons and 15 green macaroons, which is a total of 45 macaroons eaten. To find the remaining macaroons, subtract the eaten macaroons from the total initial macaroons: Remaining macaroons = Total macaroons - Eaten macaroons Remaining macaroons = 90 - 45 Remaining macaroons = 45 So, Fran will have 45 macaroons left after eating 15 green macaroons and twice as many red macaroons as green macaroons."},{"question":"Hoping to build on their win over the Falcons, the Lions stayed at home for their match-up against the San Francisco 49ers.

This force is called a magnetic force. The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them. Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch? These forces are known as non-contact forces. Another type of non-contact force you may be familiar with is gravity. Gravity too can cause changes in motion. Gravity holds our moon in orbit without touching it.

Last sentence: (B). Select from: (A). Jen loved her neighbors.; (B). Jen had the cops show up at her front door.;","response":"Story: From the day she moved into the charming little neighborhood of Maple Street, Jen had a knack for attracting chaos. She didn't mean to; it just kind of followed her around. She was a vivacious woman with fiery red hair and a contagious laughter that could be heard blocks away. Her life was a mosaic of frenzied unpredictability, much to the chagrin of her more conservation neighbors. The Watsons, a perfectly agreeable elderly couple living next door to Jen, found her lifestyle a bit too lively for their taste. The Parkers, a young family across, adored her free-spirited nature but also bore the brunt of her chaotic tendencies as their dog had a habit of getting entangled in Jen's frequent adventures. One day, Jen decided to host a lavish costume party for her diverse group of friends. With her love for art and fashion, she went all out on the decorations, transforming her modest home into a sprawling canvas of colors and emotions. Foil balloons floated from the porch, fairy lights decked the trees, and music pumped through the massive speakers she'd rented, echoing all through Maple street. She had a replica of the 'Mona Lisa' hung above her fireplace, a phone booth that was turned into a makeshift photo booth, and a 70's disco dance floor in her backyard. It was an eccentric extravaganza, and people from all walks of life sashayed into her home, dressed in all manners of whimsical attire. In the midst of jubilations, things took an unfortunate turn when the makeshift chandelier, made from dozens of colorfully painted pots and pans strung together, came crashing down on the dance floor. The boisterous laughter and lively chatter were instantly replaced by shocked gasps followed by silence. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the chaos had definitely spiked a few heart rates. Simultaneously, Mrs. Watson, who was bothered by the loud music and uncanny laughter, had called the police to report a disturbance. As Jen was picking up the remnants of the chandelier, navigating through her bewildered guests, the flashing lights of the police car illuminated her front yard. Nobody can really say they were surprised by the appearance of law enforcement. It was, after all, a typical day in the life of Jen. As the crowd parted, Jen strolled out with an apology on her lips and a barely suppressed giggle. She was an undefined artist moving through life and her canvas was her neighborhood. Despite the chaos, Jen found herself right at home, laughing it off graciously. Consequently, in her best portrayal of innocence, Jen had the cops show up at her front door. Explanation: I crafted an eccentric character named Jen, who naturally attracts chaos. Given her peculiarity, she arranges an extravagant party, which goes a bit awry. Furthermore, considering the adverse reaction of her neighbors, I cater to the expectation of the police arriving. This serves as a plausible setup to the final sentence: \\"Jen had the cops show up at her front door.\\""},{"question":"Simon was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Dorothy Simon (nee Ligeti), a homemaker, and Bernard Simon, a former journalist and then public relations director for B'nai B'rith for 20 years. In March 1977, when Simon was still in high school, Simon's father was one of a group of over 140 people held hostage (and later released) in Washington, D.C. by former national secretary of the Nation of Islam Hamaas Abdul Khaalis in the Hanafi Siege. Simon was raised in a Jewish family with roots that originated in Eastern Europe and Hungary (his maternal grandfather had changed his surname from \\"Leibowitz\\" to \\"Ligeti\\"). He has a brother, Gary Simon, and a sister, Linda Evans, who died in 1990. Upon leaving college, Simon worked as a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun from 1982 to 1995. He spent most of his career covering the crime beat. A colleague has said that Simon loved journalism and felt it was \\"God's work\\". Simon says that he was initially altruistic and was inspired to enter journalism by the Washington Post's coverage of Watergate but became increasingly pragmatic as he gained experience. Later in his career he aimed to tell the best possible story without \\"cheating it\\". Simon was a union captain when the writing staff went on strike in 1987 over benefit cuts. He remained angry after the strike ended and began to feel uncomfortable in the writing room. He searched for a reason to justify a leave of absence and settled on the idea of writing a novel. \\"I got out of journalism because some sons of bitches bought my newspaper and it stopped being fun,\\" says Simon. In an interview in Reason in 2004, Simon said that since leaving the newspaper business he has become more cynical about the power of journalism. \\"One of the sad things about contemporary journalism is that it actually matters very little. The world now is almost inured to the power of journalism. The best journalism would manage to outrage people. And people are less and less inclined to outrage,\\" said Simon. \\"I've become increasingly cynical about the ability of daily journalism to effect any kind of meaningful change. I was pretty dubious about it when I was a journalist, but now I think it's remarkably ineffectual.\\" In 1988, disillusioned, Simon took a year's leave to go into the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit to write a book. What was his relationship with journalism?","response":"Simon's relationship with journalism began with an initial sense of altruism and inspiration from the Washington Post's coverage of Watergate. He felt that journalism was \\"God's work\\" and had a great passion for it. He worked as a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun from 1982 to 1995, mostly covering the crime beat. However, over time, Simon became increasingly pragmatic and focused on telling the best possible story without compromising it. His relationship with journalism started to change as he grew disillusioned with the field, especially after the strike he participated in as a union captain in 1987 over benefit cuts. This led him to take a leave of absence and explore other areas, such as writing a novel. Simon's departure from journalism was also influenced by the frustration he felt after his newspaper was bought and its work environment changed. In the years following his departure, Simon's views on journalism evolved further, eventually becoming quite cynical. He believed that contemporary journalism had lost its power to bring about meaningful change and lacked the ability to spark outrage in people. Overall, Simon's relationship with journalism was complex, marked by passion and love for the job in the beginning and evolving into disillusionment, frustration, and cynicism over time."},{"question":"I heard that Taylor payed Kendall a visit at work to find out the states in the new development.

Since Taylor visited Kendall at work to find out about the statuses in the new development, it seems that Kendall is already at work, and involved in some project or development. So, we can eliminate option a (get out of bed) and c (go to work), as Kendall is already at work. Now, we are left with option b (give excuses about the delay). Given that Taylor has come to inquire about the progress of the project, it seems likely that there has been some delay or issue in the development.

At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death.

The satellite , which carried a payload of both C band and Ku band transponders , was launched on June 24 , 1993 and operated by PanAmSat Corporation . Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite . Galaxy IV remains in space . - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. - Univision is an American Spanish language broadcast television network that is owned by Univision Communications. The network's programming is aimed at Latino Americans and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films. - In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals. - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace. - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. There are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earths orbit, used by both private and government organizations. - Greenwich is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 61,171. The largest town on Connecticut's Gold Coast, it is home to many hedge funds and other financial service companies.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: What kind of animal is Patch?

Her father Tom (Sam Robards) has climbed Mount Everest so it runs in the family. Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her.

Negative Movie Review: \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" As an avid moviegoer, I cherish the excitement of immersing myself in a film that transports me to another world, one filled with enchanting characters, captivating storylines, and unforgettable visuals. Unfortunately, my experience with \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" left me yearning for the magic of cinematic storytelling that was so painfully absent from this film. From the outset, it was apparent that the film's plot lacked originality—a glaring issue that further unraveled as the story progressed. The movie was riddled with tropes, clichés, and scenes left me feeling bewildered by their inclusion, owing to their rather hackneyed nature. This absence of a distinctive narrative left a lingering sense of lost opportunity; a story filled with unexplored potential. Moreover, the characters in \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" were tragically underdeveloped, making it nearly impossible for viewers to form any emotional bond or invest in their stories. A lack of depth and complexity reduced the film to a shallow portrayal of cardboard cutouts parading across the screen, with dialogue that was often stilted and cringe-worthy. To make matters worse, any semblance of chemistry between the characters was glaringly absent, resulting in scenes that lacked emotion and genuine interaction. While a film's visual effects and cinematography can often redeem a weak plot and characters, \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" was unable to salvage itself through these means either. The visuals were unimaginative and lackluster, often leaning on CGI as a crutch to distract from the dull cinematography. Consequently, the film felt like a relic of a bygone era, rather than an innovative and exciting work of contemporary cinema. As if the weak story, characters and visuals weren't enough, the film's pacing was an exercise in frustration, ambling between tediously slow scenes to sudden, jarring jumps in the narrative. This erratic pacing made it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the film, serving only to underscore the fact that the end product was, regrettably, a disjointed mess. In conclusion, \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" failed to deliver the engaging and nuanced storytelling one would expect from cinema today. The uninspired plot, one-dimensional characters, bland visuals, and uneven pacing culminated in a movie that was ultimately forgettable. In an age where films can be both thought-provoking and visually stunning, this film missed the mark by a long shot. I would recommend steering clear of \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" and seeking out movies that truly exemplify the captivating power of a well-told story."},{"question":"Wow.

Například, čeština používá sedm pádů pro skloňování podstatných jmen, zatímco v angličtině se skloňování užívá pouze v omezené míře. Slovosled češtiny je také poměrně volný, což umožňuje vyjadřování různých nuancí a zaměření na různé aspekty věty. Mluvčí češtiny se často setkávají s problémy při překládání do angličtiny a naopak, protože některé výrazy a fráze nemají přímé ekvivalenty v druhém jazyce.

Czech has many grammatical rules that differ from English. For example, Czech uses seven cases for declension of nouns, whereas English only uses declension to a limited extent. Czech word order is also relatively flexible, allowing for the expression of various nuances and focusing on different aspects of the sentence. Speakers of Czech often encounter problems when translating into English and vice versa, as some expressions and phrases do not have direct equivalents in the other language.

The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey. Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations. He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957. Of the four dogs who survived the trek, Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue. The others, Oscar, Gunner and Towser, returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo, where Oscar lived, allegedly, to the age of 25. Near the end of his life Dick Richards, the last survivor of the party, was without regrets and did not regard the struggle as futile.

Katrina but not Megan had to be rushed to the hospital because -- Katrina had an allergic reaction to the paint.; -- Megan had an allergic reaction to the paint.;","response":"-- One day, in the idyllic town of Kensington, best friends Katrina and Megan embarked on a thrilling project to refurbish an old storage shed they'd found in the back of Katrina's house. Both with artistic souls, they had decided to turn this remnant of the past into a colorful art studio. Little did they know that an unforeseen circumstance would temporarily hinder their vibrant plans. -- They chose a sunny and warm Saturday to start their project. The day was perfect for painting – a clear blue sky without a sign of rain, and a weather that was neither too hot nor too cold. They gathered the necessary tools: paintbrushes, a couple of paint pots in various vibrant colors, and of course, their boundless enthusiasm. Everything was ready for this long-awaited project. -- Katrina, the more spontaneous and free-spirited of the two, immediately dove into the painting activity. She decided on a vivid magenta hue, hoping it would stand out in the middle of the green backyard. Megan, ever the deliberator, took the time to sketch a mural on one side of the shed. Their laughter reverberated through the yard as they teased each other about the 'masterpieces' they were creating. -- However, their merry moment was soon interrupted. An hour into the painting session, Katrina, who had dipped her brush into the magenta pot countless times, began to feel peculiar. She noticed a tickling sensation on her hands and neck. It wasn't long until that mild itchiness escalated into a red rash that spread across her limbs. Her face became puffy, and she started to struggle with breathing. -- Megan, who saw Katrina's drastic transformation, instantly recognized these symptoms as an allergic reaction. She had always been the one known for allergies, whether to pollen or certain types of fabric, but never paint - or at least, they had never suspected it. But today, it was Katrina who needed her quick thinking and decision-making abilities. -- Ignoring her own paint-covered hands and the unfinished mural, Megan immediately phoned for help. She explained Katrina's symptoms as quickly and clearly as she could to the emergency operator on the line. As she held on nervously, she also tried to comfort Katrina, who was in the throes of the sudden allergic reaction, assuring her that help was on its way. -- As luck would have it, the Kensington hospital was located only a few minutes away, and the ambulance arrived in the nick of time. They whisked Katrina away to the hospital, leaving Megan behind in the yard, amidst the brightly colored paint pots, the half-painted shed, and a deep-rooted concern for her best friend. -- Megan stayed behind to clean up the chaotic paint splatters, her focus diverted from the vibrant colors to her worried thoughts about Katrina's health. She was relieved that she did not have an allergic reaction to the paint, but she wished she could switch places with Katrina in a heartbeat. -- Meanwhile, at the hospital, Katrina was well taken care of. The doctors determined the allergic reaction had been due to some chemical substances found in the magenta paint she had been using. After receiving appropriate treatment and staying under observation for the night, she was finally allowed to go home. She was exhausted, but relieved that the scare was over. -- As this eventful day came to a close, both Katrina and Megan learned not only about the importance of checking for potential allergens in products used frequently, but also about the strength of their friendship. They both had a newfound appreciation for each other, which, in due time, would serve as the foundation for many more adventures—preferably, ones that didn't involve unexpected trips to the hospital. -- Back in Katrina's backyard, the half-painted shed stood a reminder of the incident. However, the girls were not disheartened. They decided to complete the project, this time, with hypoallergenic paint. Cementing the memory of their adventure, they reserved a small corner of the shed for a painting of an ambulance surrounded by swirls of magenta hue. After all, it was a story they would tell for years to come - the time when Katrina, and not Megan, had to be rushed to the hospital because she had an allergic reaction to the paint."},{"question":"president chen shui-bian presented lucky money to orphans in taoyuan county , northern taiwan sunday , the fourth day of the lunar new year , to show his concern for the wellbeing of orphans .

Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. An American version was on NBC, initially as a pilot episode on 10 November 1963, then as a series from 10 January 1964 to May 1965. The pilot featured Henry Fonda and Henry Morgan, guests Mike Nichols and Elaine May, and supporting performers including Gene Hackman. The recurring cast included Frost, Morgan, Buck Henry and Alan Alda, with Nancy Ames singing the opening song and Stanley Grover and Ames performing solos and duets; regular contributors included Gloria Steinem, William F. Brown, Tom Lehrer and Calvin Trillin. The announcer was Jerry Damon. Also a guest was Woody Allen, performing stand-up comedy; the guest star on the final broadcast was Steve Allen. A running gag was a mock feud with Jack Paar, whose own programme followed TW3 on the NBC Friday schedule; Paar repeatedly referred to TW3 as \\"Henry Morgan's Amateur Hour.\\" The American version is largely a lost program, although the pilot survives and was donated to the Library of Congress by a collector. Amateur audio recordings of most episodes also survive. After the series' cancellation, Lehrer recorded a collection of his songs used on the show, That Was The Year That Was, released by Reprise Records in September 1965. In the American version, an episode showed a smiling U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson contemplating an easy 1964 campaign against the Republican nominee, U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. The satirists sang that Goldwater could not win because he \\"does not know the dance of the liberal Republicans\\", then a substantial component of the GOP, many of whose members had supported Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York for the Republican nomination. On April 21, 1985 in the United States, the ABC network aired That Was The Week That Was as a special, hosted by David Frost (also serving as an executive producer) and Anne Bancroft, and featuring future Saturday Night Live cast members Jan Hooks and A. Whitney Brown and puppetry from Spitting Image. Kristy Glass and Kevin Ruf starred in a remake of TW3 for ABC's Primetime Live in the fall of 2004. Soon after its premiere, Shelley Ross, the executive producer, was fired and TW3 ended with her dismissal.

The specific word choice in the short movie review leads to the assessment that their opinion of the film is unfavorable. The adjective 'contemptible' means deserving contempt, which is a strong way to communicate a dislike or disapproval. Contempt reflects a feeling that something is not worthy of respect or consideration. The disapproval seems to be directed toward the movie for its perceived shortcomings, and overall, the critic considers the film to be unremarkable or distasteful. In addition, the critic describes the movie as an 'imitator,' which implies that it is unoriginal and perhaps derivative of other films. When a movie is considered an imitator, it suggests that it unsuccessfully attempts to replicate the success of another film, often by copying or appropriating themes and stylistic elements. As a result, the movie loses its originality and may be perceived as a lesser version of something that came before it. Taking these insights together, one can deduce that the critic holds a negative view of the movie. They likely found the film to be repulsive and derivative, which is to say, it failed to deliver anything new, unique, or valuable for the viewer. In summary, this short movie review likely indicates a strong disapproval of the film, with the critic believing that it falls far short of being a quality cinematic experience."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: This August, we'll welcome guests from all over the world.

Now, let's think step by step:","response":"A: No, the 23rd Amendment did not give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for the president of the United States. Let's break down the reasoning behind this: 1. The 23rd Amendment: The 23rd Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified on March 29, 1961, extended the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens residing in the District of Columbia. It granted the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) a number of electors in the Electoral College equivalent to the number of electors for the least populous state. This gave citizens living in the District of Columbia the ability to vote for the president and vice president, which they could not do previously. 2. Puerto Rico's status: Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States, acquired in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. While residents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens, Puerto Rico itself is not a state. In accordance with the Insular Cases, a series of Supreme Court decisions in the early 20th century, territories like Puerto Rico do not have the same constitutional rights as states. As a result, Puerto Rico does not have voting representation in Congress and its residents cannot vote in presidential elections. 3. Political movements and attempts for change: Over the years, there have been several political movements and discussions on whether Puerto Rico should become a state or an independent country. The island has held several non-binding referendums on the issue of statehood, with the most recent one in 2020, where the majority voted in favor of statehood. However, Congress has not yet taken action to admit Puerto Rico as a state. In conclusion, the 23rd Amendment did not extend the right to vote for the president to residents of Puerto Rico, as it solely dealt with granting electoral votes to the District of Columbia. Puerto Rican residents still cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections due to their territory status, and this would require either statehood for Puerto Rico or a separate constitutional amendment to change."},{"question":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Pre-Ordering School Lunches Steer Kids To Healthier Meal Choices Along the lines of advice to avoid grocery shopping when you’re hungry, new research concludes that children who electronically pre-order their lunch are more likely to make healthier meal choices than students who pick and choose as they make their way through the cafeteria line. The four-week study looked at the choices made by 272 students in grades 1 to 5 in two schools in upstate New York. When the students pre-ordered their lunches, 29% were more likely to pick a healthier entrée compared to 15% when the option to pre-order was unavailable. When students chose their entrée in the lunch line, they were 48% less likely to make a healthy choice and 21% more likely to chose a less healthy entrée. (MORE: Stricter School Lunch Standards Lead To Lighter Kids) In the study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, researchers from Cornell University suggest that preordering lunch entrées could prevent distractions like sights and smells that could prompt kids to make hasty and potentially unhealthy choices when picking their meals. Anti-obesity advocates and public health experts continually look for ways to measurably change the food environments for children in schools. In January 2012 the U.S. Department of Agriculture revised school meal guidelines and required more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and stricter calorie limits. The stricter guidelines were met with mixed reviews, with some children complaining the calorie limits didn’t fill them up. In response, the USDA allowed the schools more flexibility in meat and grain servings. But there’s still debate about the restrictions. As school lunch nutritional standards continue evolving, research is showing that having healthier options in school cafeterias could effectively curb weight gain and cravings for unhealthy treats. (MORE: More Food for Hungry Students: USDA Tweaks School Meals) “I think that some of the great things that happened with updating the school meal standards was that there were more fruits and vegetables,” says Jessica Donze Black, project director for The Pew Charitable Trusts Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project. Black is unaffiliated with the study. “We all recognize that kids don’t get enough fruits and vegetables and certainly giving them more is a good thing. When we look at the schools that have been successful with that, where the kids are really eating more fruits and vegetables, there are some strategies that are really working.” Some schools have already seen success, and Black says some of the most successful and sustainable changes in lunchroom fare and eating habits have been among schools involving students in the menu decision-making process. ”Giving children an opportunity to taste-test allows them to provide feedback and an opportunity to show their preferences,” says Black. It helps also if schools are rolling the lunch room changes out over time; getting used to healthier options doesn’t happen overnight. “A lot of those schools who have done well with integrating the foods will say they started the process a couple of years ago,” says Black. (MORE: Cutting Out Soda Curbs Children’s Weight Gain, Studies Show) While pre-ordering meals may be a strategy for steering kids toward healthier choices, Black says that the overall food environment makes a greater difference in whether kids choose healthy food options. “It is not just what is in the meals, but what’s in the rest of the school food environment. What’s in the a la carte line, what’s in the vending machine, what’s in the school’s store. It’s important all those foods are also healthy so we are not making fruits and vegetables compete with cookies and cakes when it comes to students’ tastes,” she says. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project’s recent health impact assessment (HIA) showed that revising national nutrition standards for snacks and drinks sold in schools not only helps students maintain a good weight but also benefits school budgets by increasing revenue for school food services. Without unhealthy snacks, the research found students are more likely to buy school meals. “This is also better for school budgets because they get reimbursements from the federal governments for all those meals. It’s a win-win,” says Black. As researchers continue to pinpoint the most successful strategies for healthier students — and schools continue to implement them — there’s hope that that now and in the future children’s weight and energy will reach healthy levels.

Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is the author's profession?

To determine how many 60-minute periods there are within a day, we need to know how many minutes are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, and each hour consists of 60 minutes. To calculate the number of 60-minute periods in a day, we can simply multiply the number of hours in a day (24) by the number of minutes in an hour (60): 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes/day Now, to find the number of 60-minute periods, also known as \\"hourly slots\\" or simply \\"hours\\" within a day, we can then divide the total number of minutes in a day (1440) by the number of minutes in each period (60): 1440 minutes/day ÷ 60 minutes/period = 24 periods/day Thus, there are 24 60-minute periods each day during which mass transit in New York City is open and operational.

The word \\"witty\\" is suggestive of a positive opinion since it generally denotes cleverness and humor. However, it is essential to consider the entire context and other words in the review to conclusively determine its overall tone and opinion. \\"Witty\\" typically has a positive connotation, as it implies that the movie contains clever and humorous dialogues or situations. If the reviewer appreciates wit and finds it enjoyable, they likely have a positive opinion of the film. For instance, witty conversations between characters can keep the audience engaged and entertained, while also adding depth and richness to the storyline. On the other hand, it is essential to consider the context and the elements surrounding the movie. If the overall theme or genre of the movie is inappropriate to showcase wit, humor, or cleverness, the reviewer's use of \\"witty\\" might indicate sarcasm, thereby expressing a negative opinion. For example, in films that depict serious or tragic events, sarcasm may communicate that the humor felt forced or misplaced. Moreover, the reviewer's personal preferences and viewpoints also play a crucial role in determining the sentiment of the review. While some people may appreciate wit and humor, others might find it unimpressive or off-putting. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors while deducing the overall tone of the review. To summarize, based on the single word \\"witty,\\" the review suggests a positive opinion of the movie since it usually signifies cleverness and humor. However, considering the entire context and other factors would provide better clarity and make it possible to unambiguously determine if the review has a positive or negative opinion of the movie."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what is the capital city of south carolina?\\" Answer:","response":"Columbia"},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What does the paper say about the brain?\\" is in \\"The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J.

With the demand for medications continually increasing, the production and distribution of essential drugs have been insufficient to meet the needs of patients globally. In an unprecedented and critical move, former President Barack Obama is reported to have ordered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take necessary measures to address and alleviate the situation. The Scope and Impact of Drug Shortages The drug shortages have had wide-ranging effects across the nation, impacting numerous health care facilities, patients, medical professionals, and insurance providers. Evidence indicates that the problem affects drugs intended for various health issues, including cancer treatment, cardiac care, infectious diseases, neurological disorders, and anesthesia. This shortage has substantially restricted the availability of life-saving medications in hospitals and outpatient departments. Consequently, medical practitioners have been compelled to rely on alternative treatments that may not be as effective or face increased costs for acquiring the needed drugs from alternative sources. The Detrimental Effects on Patients and Providers The consequences of drug shortages have been particularly harmful for patients requiring immediate or specialized care. In certain cases, individuals have been forced to wait for long periods to receive vital medications or have their treatment plans altered due to the scarcity of necessary drugs. Furthermore, the increased pressure on healthcare providers to find alternative treatments and medication sources comes at a significant financial burden, which inevitably affects the institutions and individuals they serve. Obama's Call to FDA: Strategies to Address Drug Shortages Understanding the urgency of the situation, Obama ordered the FDA to implement crucial measures to stem the shortages and ensure appropriate medication availability across the nation. Among the key recommendations are: 1. Streamlining review processes: In an effort to enhance efficiency, the FDA will be asked to simplify and speed up its review and approval processes for new drug applications. This will facilitate the introduction of potential alternatives for medications in short supply, fostering competition amongst drug manufacturers and reducing the likelihood of unexpected shortages. 2. Strengthening pharmaceutical manufacturing: In response to the acknowledgment that manufacturing issues contribute to drug shortages, Obama's directive also calls for the FDA to support the improvement of production techniques and infrastructure within the pharmaceutical industry. This will serve not only to alleviate current shortages but also to prevent future issues from arising. 3. Enhancing communication and collaboration: To ensure better management of drug supply, the FDA will be required to work closely with the drug manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders. Fostering open communication channels will improve the industry's ability to anticipate and address potential shortages proactively. 4. Increasing transparency: Another key aspect of Obama's call to action involves the promotion of greater transparency among drug manufacturers. This includes mandatory notifications to the FDA by companies if they foresee shortages, allowing the FDA to act preemptively and source alternative medications for patients. 5. Encouraging drug stockpiling: Lastly, the FDA will investigate the feasibility of encouraging stockpiling of essential medications. This could mitigate the effects of unexpected manufacturing issues or increased demand, ensuring a more stable supply of necessary drugs. Conclusion President Obama's directive exemplifies his commitment to the health and well-being of citizens across the nation. By ordering the FDA to take proactive measures to address the drug shortage crisis, his administration took a decisive approach in ensuring the continuity and quality of care for every individual. Although long-term solutions to drug shortages may be challenging to establish, Obama's vital intervention demonstrates the importance of addressing this issue and serves as a crucial foundation for future improvements in the pharmaceutical industry."},{"question":"Given the below context: The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south. However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\").

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. and the situation: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Answer the following question: Does Brandon's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, one could argue that Brandon's soil likely contains fewer toxic compounds than Jeff's. When soil becomes hypoxic, as is the case with Jeff's soil, chemical reactions change due to the lack of oxygen. More specifically, anaerobic bacteria, which can thrive in such conditions, switch to using nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. This process can lead to the formation of toxic compounds within the soil. In contrast, Brandon's soil is not reported to be hypoxic indicating it has a sufficient level of oxygen. This means that typical aerobic processes are likely occurring, including normal nitrification, the process where ammonium is converted to nitrate by aerobic bacteria. Normal oxygen levels deter the growth and thus the metabolic pathways of anaerobic bacteria, reducing the chances for toxic compounds to be formed, and suggesting a healthier soil environment. While anaerobic conditions might lead to the reduction of certain environmental substances (like nitrate, sulfate, and manganese) to potentially harmful reduction forms, in aerated and well-drained soils, soil microorganisms tend to convert them back to benign substances. Overall, the presence or absence of toxic compounds can be significantly influenced by soil hypoxia, but there are other factors involved too, such as the initial concentration of these substances and the types of microorganisms present in each soil. Other aspects like pH, soil type, temperature, and the presence of certain plant types can also affect this. To have a definitive answer, both farmers would need to test their soils for these compounds. Theoretically, though, Jeff's hypoxic soil would be at a higher risk of containing toxic compounds compared to Brandon's non-hypoxic soil. In addition, it is important to note that not all effects of hypoxia are detrimental — certain crops and plants can adapt to or tolerate low oxygen conditions. These plants, such as the many found in wetlands, have evolved to survive in these circumstances via mechanisms such as aerenchyma, which aids in the transport of oxygen to the roots in a hypoxic environment."},{"question":"Solve -52*g - 60 = -40*g for g..

For roughly the billionth time, we learned this past week that politics and social media are often (always?) a toxic combo. The latest chapter in the “How not to use social media” book, which will have roughly an infinite number of entries before it’s all said and done, was written by Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.). Lauten, having watched Malia and Sasha Obama looking less than enthused at the White House’s annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning, took to Facebook, writing in part: “Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. . . . Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.” Knowingly or not, Lauten violated one of the few adhered-to commandments of political Washington: Thou shalt not talk about politicians’ children. After a predictable media backlash, she apologized — via Facebook, natch. “I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager,” she wrote. Too late. By Monday, Lauten had resigned. By Tuesday, conservatives had begun attacking the press for its allegedly over-the-top coverage of a junior staffer for a backbench member — evidence, they insisted, of the media’s liberal bias. The end result of this now-familiar outrage cycle was heightened disgust — if that’s even possible — with everyone and everything in Washington. Elizabeth Lauten, for bringing us all back to high school, you had the worst week in Washington. Congrats, or something. Each week, Chris Cillizza awards the worst week in Washington to an inhabitant of Planet Beltway who stands out for all the wrong reasons.

What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"An adult named Elizabeth Lauten made a mistake by writing mean things about two young girls, Malia and Sasha Obama, on the internet. People were upset because it's not nice to say mean things about other people's children, especially when they are just teenagers. Elizabeth then said she was sorry, but she had to quit her job because many people didn't like what she did. So, she had a really bad week."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA. UEFA consists of 55 national association members. - The UEFA Champions League is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champion (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of each UEFA national association. The final of the 201213 tournament was the most watched UEFA Champions League final to date, as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide in 2013, drawing 360 million television viewers. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The UEFA Champions League Anthem , officially titled simply as \`\` Champions League '' , is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League , written by English composer Tony Britten in 1992 . - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services. What is the relationship between 'uefa champions league anthem' and 'national anthem'? A:","response":"The relationship between the 'UEFA Champions League Anthem' and a 'national anthem' is that both are musical compositions associated with specific organizations or entities. The UEFA Champions League Anthem is the official anthem for the UEFA Champions League, a prestigious football club competition in Europe, while a national anthem is a patriotic musical composition representing a country and its people. Both serve as symbols and hold significant meaning for the respective groups they represent, though a national anthem typically carries more historical and cultural significance."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: beach, morning, stone","response":"On a beautiful morning, as the golden sun ascended above the horizon and painted the sky with warm hues, I strolled along the serene beach, my feet sinking into the soft, wet sand, feeling connected to the earth, when I stumbled upon an unusually shaped stone, speckled with flecks of color that shimmered in the sunlight, which, to me, seemed like an emblematic treasure offered up by the magnificent ocean, reminding me yet again how the simplest experiences can evoke the most profound emotions and memories."},{"question":"Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.

The grandmother arrives on the scene. When baby cries, she plants the little one firmly in its crib, turns down the light, pats and soothes the tiny restless hands that fight the air, watches, waits.

Classify each post into the following categories : AUTHOR (if the author of the post is wrong in the situation), OTHER (if any of the others mentioned in the paragraph is wrong), EVERYBODY (if everyone mentioned is wrong) and NOBODY (if no one is wrong in the situation). I have a close friend Bob. We've been friends for almost a decade. We live in the same city now. Since we've not always been together our friend circles have evolved separately. While we live separately we meet every day after work and have dinner together (a fact most of our common friends are aware of). He introduced me recently to a childhood friend of his (John Doe) whom I've met a couple times in social gatherings. John is about to have a baby and he with his wife were planning for a baby shower and looking for venues. On Bob's idea, John and his wife visited my apartment to checkout our Clubhouse as a potential venue and decided to book it for their event. This week I invited John to checkout the clubhouse so they can plan their event in more detail which they couldn't do the first time. John and his wife decided to come over to check it out on Tuesday. I invited them to dinner at my house which they gladly accepted. I mentioned about this invitation to Bob when I met him on Monday. Bob was non sure if he should join but I insisted he should. He did not protest my insistence. On Tuesday John decided to move the meeting to Wednesday. I mentioned this to Bob on Tuesday to which his response was not noteworthy/neutral. On Wed when I talked to Bob, he asked if John knew Bob would be at my house for the dinner. It never occurred to me to mention this to John since I assumed he wouldn't mind if Bob was around for dinner since he is close to Bob. I also assumed he would be more comfortable if Bob was around since this would be the first time me and John (with his wife) would meet in a close setting. Bob decided not to show up to the dinner because he was not comfortable with the fact that John wasn't aware that Bob would join for the dinner. We had an argument the next day about social norms in general and that if I am inviting someone for dinner they should be aware who else is around. Bob's point of view: * He is not comfortable joining for dinner if the other guests are not aware he is going to be around since it feels like he is crashing a party. * I should not assume what people are comfortable with and make an effort to be transparent. My point of view : * Bob and John are close and it was Bob's idea for John to checkout the clubhouse in my apartment to rent. * John has a general idea of Bob's routine and that we meet daily. * Bob had 2 days to let me know his feeling instead of throwing a tantrum on the day we were supposed to meet. * It's my house. I am the one inviting people for dinner. Do I really need to go into details of what social constraints people are comfortable with? * I think as long as I know two people are on talking terms (not even close friends) I don't really need to try and inform the details of the social setting they are getting into. * To top it all off, the first question John's wife asked me 10 mins after they arrived, Why's Bob not around and when would he come. &amp;#x200B; A:","response":"EVERYBODY In this situation, there is a degree of misunderstanding and miscommunication from all parties involved, making everybody somewhat in the wrong. Bob's insistence on not attending the dinner because John was not informed of his presence may come from a place of wanting to respect John's privacy, but he could have communicated this concern sooner and more effectively. He also could have directly informed John of his intention to attend the dinner if it was so important to him. The author made assumptions about the comfort levels of both John and Bob without explicitly confirming their feelings, potentially causing unnecessary conflict. While it is the author's house and they have the prerogative to invite whomever they want, ensuring that all invited guests are informed about who will be present can help to avoid awkward situations or misunderstandings. In general, it is best to be transparent about social settings, even if the people involved are friends or acquaintances. John and his wife assumed that Bob would be present without confirming it. Since they were not opposed to Bob's presence, they could have mentioned their expectation to the author, which might have prevented the misunderstanding."},{"question":"After a tough home loss to the Texans, the Raiders traveled east to take on the Patriots.

Choices: - Hydrogen bond - Ionic bond - Polar bond - covalent A: Answer:","response":"To determine which bond forms due to a more stable arrangement of electrons, let's evaluate each type of bond: 1. Hydrogen bond: Hydrogen bonds are weak intermolecular attractions between molecules with polar covalent bonds, involving hydrogen atoms. These bonds are important for the properties of water and certain biological molecules but do not involve a more stable electron arrangement within the atom itself. 2. Ionic bond: Ionic bonds are formed when an atom transfers its valence electrons to another atom, resulting in a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion). This transfer allows both atoms to achieve a more stable electron arrangement, often achieving a full valence electron shell, as in the case of noble gases. 3. Polar bond: A polar bond is a type of covalent bond in which electrons are not shared equally between the bonded atoms. These bonds do not involve a transfer of electrons, so they do not directly contribute to a more stable electron arrangement. 4. Covalent bond: Covalent bonds involve the sharing of pairs of electrons between atoms, allowing both to achieve a more stable electron arrangement by filling their valence shells. These bonds are responsible for the formation of molecules and molecular compounds, such as water, methane, and carbon dioxide. Answer: Ionic bond and covalent bond both give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons, but ionic bond is the most suitable answer in this case because it involves the transfer of electrons which directly results in more stable electron configuration."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - Grapes are grown - A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container What might be the last step of the process?

The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973. A review of the concert published in Melody Maker..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The full name of the person who reportedly said he was \\"Sick up to here with it,\\" according to a review in Melody Maker, is Raymond Douglas Davies. Better known as Ray Davies, he was the lead vocalist, guitarist, and chief songwriter for the band that eventually became the Kinks. This statement was made during an onstage announcement at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973, amidst Ray Davies' personal struggles with depression and a collapsing marriage."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

She is exploring the outer rims of the galaxy when she discovers two new planets that may be suitable. The atmospheric makeup of these planets is very similar to Pam's current home. After running a quick diagnostic, the only difference that Pam sees is that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A. and a hint : The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Please answer this question : Which planet has more less inside its atmosphere?","response":"Between the two planets discovered by Pam during her mission, planet A has less carbon dioxide in its atmosphere compared to planet B. This significant detail can play a crucial role in determining the suitability of these planets for human habitation. As mentioned in the hint, global warming and climate change are real and pressing concerns caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being the main culprit. Greenhouse gases, due to their molecular structure, are highly effective in trapping heat within the atmosphere. This leads to a rise in Earth's temperature and contributes to various adverse effects on the planet and human existence. Warming caused by greenhouse gases is responsible for the destruction or alteration of natural habitats and a decline in wildlife populations. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report suggesting a significant temperature increase between 1990 and 2100, it is crucial that human colonization considers the long-term consequences of adding carbon dioxide to a planet's atmosphere. With this in mind, planet A, with comparatively lower carbon dioxide levels in its atmosphere, would be a more promising option for human habitation. Given the urgency in mitigating the effects of global warming and preserving natural environments, selecting a planet with less atmospheric carbon dioxide would provide a better foundation for sustainable human settlement. However, Pam should also consider other factors before making a final decision, such as the availability of resources, geological stability, and potential habitability for humans and other life forms. Both planets should be thoroughly studied to ensure that the selected planet will meet the long-term needs of the settlers and minimize any negative impact on the environment."},{"question":"How is \\"The Metamorphosis Foundation expressed concern that the new form of \\"preventive eavesdropping\\" lacks defined mechanisms for preventing arbitrary abuse of the new powers.\\" said in Romanian?","response":"\\"Fundatia Metamorfoza a exprimat îngrijorări cu privire la faptul că noua formă de „interceptare preventivă” nu are mecanisme bine definite pentru a preveni abuzul arbitrar al noilor puteri.\\" În această traducere, am redat ideea de preocupare a Fundației Metamorfoza în legătură cu lipsa unor mecanisme clare de prevenire a abuzului arbitrar al noilor puteri introduse prin \\"interceptarea preventivă\\".

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Earthquakes are complex natural phenomena that involve the release of energy from the Earth's crust due to the movement of tectonic plates. Scientists have been studying earthquakes for many years, gathering data about their frequency, intensity, and the factors contributing to their occurrence. They use this data to understand patterns and develop models to assess seismic hazards in different regions. However, there is still no definitive method to predict the exact time and location of an earthquake. Several factors contribute to this uncertainty, including the complex interactions between tectonic plates, the variety of fault systems and their behaviors, and the limited data available for studying past earthquakes. Moreover, fault systems can behave differently over time, and minor variations in their interactions can lead to significantly different outcomes. Despite advancements in our understanding of earthquake processes, limitations in our knowledge, and the inherently chaotic nature of these events, make it impossible to accurately predict when and where an earthquake will occur. Consequently, the answer to whether it is possible to predict the exact time and place of an earthquake is: it is not possible to tell."},{"question":"Process: - EGG - ITS LAID ON A LEAF OR PLANT - THE EGG HATCHES - THE LARVA COMES OUT(CATERPILLAR) - IT BEGINS TO EAT ON THE LEAF THAT IS WAS BORN ON - CONTINUES TO EAT TO GROW QUICKLY - AFTER ITS GROWN TO FULL LENGHT IT FORMS INTO A PUPA - UNDERGOES METAMORPHOSIS TO BECOME BUTTERFLY - AFTER HE BUTTERFLY IS FOMED IT PUMPS BLOOD INTO ITS WINGS TO GAIN STRENGHT TO BE ABLE TO FLY - TH EBUTTERLFY IS FIANLLY ABLE TO FLY AWAY.

By Alex Greig PUBLISHED: 19:25 EST, 10 March 2014 | UPDATED: 22:49 EST, 10 March 2014 A Virginia family is campaigning to encourage a drug company to allow their sick little boy who is fighting for his life access to life-saving medicine. Josh Hardy, a seven-year-old cancer survivor, needs a drug called Brincidofovir, made by small North Carolina drug company Chimerex, to fight off a viral infection he developed after a recent bone marrow transplant. The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but it has been administered to hundreds of other patients under 'compassionate use' allowances.","response":"The Hardy family has been working tirelessly to petition the Chimerex pharmaceutical company and the FDA for their son's access to Brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral medication that doctors believe could save Josh Hardy's life. Despite their efforts, Chimerex initially denied the family's request, citing the need to focus on the drug's ongoing clinical trials and the potential risk of diverting resources away from the greater good. This decision led to a massive public outcry, as social media campaigns and petitions drew attention to the desperate situation facing Josh Hardy and his family. In response to the mounting public pressure, Chimerex reconsidered its position and ultimately agreed to allow Josh Hardy to participate in an expanded \\"compassionate use\\" program. This program would not only provide Josh with access to Brincidofovir, but it would also be expanded to include other critically ill patients who meet specific eligibility criteria. With this new agreement in place, Chimerex would be able to continue their clinical trials while also addressing the needs of those in immediate need of treatment. Josh Hardy began receiving the experimental treatment shortly afterward, facing a long and uncertain road to recovery. Under the watchful eyes of his medical team and the support of his family, friends, and an ever-growing community of supporters, Josh began to show signs of improvement. The viral infection that was attacking his body started to recede, and his doctors became increasingly optimistic about his prognosis. Over the subsequent months, Josh's recovery continued, and his story became a testament to the power of perseverance, public advocacy, and the potential benefits of compassionate use programs. The Chimerex pharmaceutical company, for its part, pledged to work closely with the FDA and other regulatory bodies to advance the clinical research and approval process for Brincidofovir, with a particular emphasis on ensuring broader access to the drug for patients in need. As Brincidofovir moves through the later stages of clinical trials and the FDA approval process, Josh Hardy's story serves as a powerful reminder that behind every experimental drug, there is a human face and a personal story. His fight for access to this life-saving medication highlights the critical importance of striking a balance between the urgency of individual patient needs and the careful, methodical process of drug development and approval. In doing so, the story sparked a broader public conversation and debate over the ethics and efficacy of the current compassionate use guidelines and the potential for reform in this crucial area of the healthcare system."},{"question":"In this task, you're given two sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, and the genre they belong to.

Article: Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or refresh them during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to drinking coffee. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy', which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong noise, taking in unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The tasteless caffeine spray is absorbed through the skin and spread through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that lasts longer than drinking a cup of coffee. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spray 'Sprayable Energy' contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: \\"The reason for this is our product isn't entirely metabolized by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.\\" Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as wrists, the neck or behind the ears, but warns users not to exceed 20 times a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel awake and focus without being over-excited, which is common with coffee and energy drinks.

Step 2: Analyze the second statement - \\"Two young girls with dyed hair ignored the two boys in black.\\" This statement suggests that the two young girls did not pay attention to or communicate with the two boys. Step 3: Compare the two statements to determine if they mean the same thing. In the first statement, the girls are talking to the boys, indicating an interaction. In the second statement, the girls are ignoring the boys, indicating a lack of interaction. These two statements are conflicting. Step 4: Determine the answer based on the comparison. Since the two statements are in conflict, one cannot mean the other. Therefore, the answer is: - no"},{"question":"Article:More than 150 locations feature on the online map, which presently covers only the nation's east coast. The total number of deaths following British settlement in 1788 has long been debated, but many historians estimate it numbered tens of thousands. Researchers hope the map will help with education and creating monuments. The project includes details about the number of people killed at each site, which weapons were used, and who was responsible. The information was compiled over four years and corroborated through sources including settler diaries, newspaper reports, court records and letters. \\"For many Australians, this kind of information will come as a shock,\\" project author Prof Lyndall Ryan told the BBC. \\"Our ancestors were out there engaging in some pretty violent forms of behaviour.\\" More than 150 massacres affecting almost every Aboriginal clan took place between 1788 and 1872, compared with six recorded massacres of colonists during the same period. A massacre was defined as the indiscriminate killing of six or more undefended people, the study said. Prof Ryan said several violent events claimed more than 60 lives, while about 150 people were killed in one incident in Victoria's Gippsland region. Prof Ryan, a historian at Australia's University of Newcastle, said the team will document the country's west over the next two years. She hopes it will help inspire memorials around Australia, similar to those acknowledging casualties in World War I. \\"We are going to need monuments to realise that this was an ongoing war,\\" she said. \\"I hope it will lead to a clearer understanding of why the situation with Aboriginal people is still so desperate today.\\" Discussion about better recognising Australia's first peoples has intensified this year, with a historic summit in May calling for a new formal body in parliament. Earlier this year, the Australian government rejected calls to change the date of Australia Day, which commemorates the arrival of Britain's First Fleet, despite many indigenous Australians referring to it as \\"invasion day\\". A summary of the above article is?","response":"This article talks about a new online map that shows many places where something very sad happened in Australia a long time ago, after people from Britain started living there in 1788. Many of these sad events, called massacres, hurt the native people called Aboriginals. The map helps us learn about what happened and can help build special places to remember those who suffered. An important person named Prof Lyndall Ryan says this can help us understand why Aboriginal people still face challenges today."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"People walking about a university campus with palm trees in the background.\\" is it true that \\"People walking across a bridge with palm trees in the background.\\"? A step-by-step solution is:","response":"Step 1: Analyze both sentences Sentence 1: \\"People walking about a university campus with palm trees in the background.\\" Sentence 2: \\"People walking across a bridge with palm trees in the background.\\" Step 2: Identify the similarities and differences Similarities: - Both sentences describe people walking. - Both sentences have palm trees in the background.

Conclusion: Based on the given sentence 1, it is not true that sentence 2 depicts the same scene, since they have different locations (university campus vs. bridge). However, both sentences share similar elements, such as people walking and palm trees in the background."},{"question":"Robin took a cooking class because people were complaining about her. Given the context: Why did Robin do this? Possible answers: find out people are mad, improve her cooking, sign up for the cooking class","response":"Robin took the cooking class primarily to improve her cooking skills, as people around her were complaining about her cooking abilities. It seems as though Robin was experiencing criticism and dissatisfaction from others concerning her culinary skills, which may have made her feel inadequate or motivated her to take action and make a change. By enrolling in a cooking class, she aimed to rectify the issue, ultimately leading to a more favorable outcome in her relationships and her sense of self-worth. First and foremost, Robin's intention was to gain knowledge and techniques to enhance her cooking abilities.

I doesn't back up automatically anymore. I lost all my messages\\" Answer:","response":"Assigning a rating to a review can be seen from two perspectives - the quality of the review itself in terms of its insightfulness, clarity, comprehensiveness, etc., and the experience of the user that the review is expressing. Looking at this review, it is quite evident that the user has had a disappointing experience with the product or service being reviewed. They have mentioned three major issues: the product has stopped working, it does not back up automatically, and as a result, they have lost all their messages. These three points suggest that the product's functionality or features failed to meet the user's expectations or requirements, leading to a negative experience. Thus, if we were to rate the user's experience based on the issues reflected in the review, we might give it a score of 1, reflecting a least favorable experience. On the other hand, if we are evaluating the quality of the review itself, a few factors might need to be considered. In terms of clarity, the review is straightforward and quickly gets to the point. However, it lacks some crucial details that could have made it more helpful to both the product developers as well as potential buyers. For instance, the user has not mentioned which product they are referring to, the context of their usage, nor did they provide any specific scenarios about when or how the problems occurred. The absence of these kinds of details makes it less actionable for the developers to improve the product and less effective as a guide for potential customers trying to make a purchasing decision. Consequently, in terms of its usefulness as a review, it might be rated 2, indicating room for significant improvement. Overall, while the rating largely depends on the aspects you prioritize, it probably would lie between 1 and 2 based on the parameters discussed above."},{"question":"Summarize this article: First impressions are usually formed within 30 seconds. The first thing an employer will notice is your physical appearance. Pick a wardrobe that communicates effort and professionalism. Research the company's dress code going into the interview. If you know anyone from the company, ask them what's appropriate. You can also call the company's Human Resource Department and ask what is recommended in terms of attire. If you're interviewing for a professional, managerial, or executive position you should always wear a suit. Have a few interview suits, preferably tailored to your body, on hand to choose from. If the attire is business casual, or if you're applying for a lower ranking position, a nice blouse with dress pants or a skirt is a good choice for women. Men can wear dress pants and a button down shirt and tie. If this is for a factory, construction, or other such job where you will get dirty, wear sensible attire to the interview, this includes steel-toed safety shoes and if it's a construction site, you'll need to wear a hard hat (not a bump hat) to get from the gate to the office. Do not forget footwear. Oftentimes, an outfit is great but shoes are tattered or worn. Invest in comfortable, work-appropriate shoes. Do not fret if you have to pay a little more. Remember, you will use these shoes often when you land a job. Avoid perfumes and other fragrances, which can appear tacky and put off interviewers. While accessories, like a nice belt or tasteful jewelry, can be a nice touch avoid anything overly flashy or distracting. If you wear make-up, stick to neutral shades of lipstick, eye-liner, and eye shadow. Your make-up should ideally enhance your existing facial features without overwhelming them. Never go into an interview without prior knowledge of the company. This conveys a lack of interest and respect on your part. Conduct thorough research in the days leading up to an interview. Know what skills the company values. Look at the career page on their website and pay close attention to the desired qualifications listed on their job postings. This gives you the opportunity to learn more about a given company and discover what aspects of your skill set and career history to emphasize. Read up on the latest news involving the company. Oftentimes, company websites have a section dedicated to press releases and news coverage. You can also search for the company's name in Google News. Research the company's mission and values. You'll want to make sure you come off as a good fit for the company's culture. There should be a section on the company's website with a mission statement. You can also follow the company on social media to get a sense of their ethos. Find out who your interviewer will be. Oftentimes, this is disclosed in the email asking you to come in for an interview. If not, you can politely request their name. Research the interviewer on LinkedIn and Twitter. This increases your chance of connecting and, in turn, landing the job. Concrete is better than abstract when it comes to wowing an interviewer. You should have a few solid anecdotes prepared that speak to your experience. People tend to remember stories easier than direct information. Therefore, telling a story rather than simply conveying your experience means you'll stand out in an interviewer's mind. Ask yourself, what are the skill sets this company is looking for? Write down a list of skills and, from there, try to come up with stories from past jobs, volunteer experiences, and internships that illustrate your proficiency with said skills. Have 2 to 3 anecdotes to choose from going in. Rehearse. Recite the stories to yourself to make sure you include all necessary information and don't slip up or stutter during the interview. You can always record yourself speaking and play back the recording to see where you need to improve. It's not uncommon for employers to scan the Twitter and Facebook accounts of potential employees. Make sure your social media presence is clean before going into an interview. Curse words do not reflect well on you as a potential employee. Make sure any obscenity is removed. A negative attitude can be a deterrent to employment and people often take to Twitter and Facebook to complain. Delete tweets or statues that air grievances about friends, family members, or businesses. If you want to err on the side of caution, you can temporarily deactivate your Facebook or Twitter profile the week before your interview. You can also change privacy settings so only certain posts are visible to the public.","response":"First impressions in an interview are critical and are usually formed within 30 seconds. To make a good impression, dress professionally and in line with the company's dress code. Be well-groomed and avoid strong fragrances, flashy accessories, or overwhelming makeup.

Prepare 2-3 anecdotes that demonstrate your relevant skills and practice telling these stories. Find out who your interviewer will be and research them on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter to increase your chances of connecting during the interview.

The French also had an early machine-gun type weapon, the mitrailleuse, which could fire its thirty-seven barrels at a range of around 1,200 yd (1,100 m). It was developed in such secrecy, that little training with the weapon had occurred, leaving French gunners with no experience; the gun was treated like artillery and in this role it was ineffective. Worse still, once the small number of soldiers who had been trained how to use the new weapon became casualties, there were no replacements who knew how to operate the mitrailleuse. What is the answer to this question: What aspect of the Chassepot was superior to the German needle gun?","response":"The Chassepot was a French rifle that was better than the German needle gun in this way: it could shoot much further. While the Chassepot could hit targets 1,500 yards (1,400 meters) away, the German needle gun could only shoot 600 yards (550 meters) far. This made the Chassepot a stronger weapon in a fight."},{"question":"Sentence: The Acta Palaeontologica Polonica (abbreviated Acta Palaeontol. Pol.), has the ISSN number \\"1732-2421\\". What data can be extracted from this sentence?","response":"Numerous pieces of data can be extracted from the given sentence, demonstrating how rich even a solitary sentence can be in terms of information density. The data extracted falls into several categories, including details about journal identity, content focus, bibliographic referencing, and publication identification. 1. Publication Identification: The primary piece of data mentioned is the designation of the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN 1732-2421). The ISSN functions as an identifier for serial publications, similar to the role ISBNs play for individual books. It is unique to a particular serial, allowing for efficient cataloguing and retrieval in libraries and databases throughout the world. This number indicates that the Acta Palaeontologica Polonica is recorded in the global ISSN database, facilitating rapid identification and management. 2. Journal Identity: The name of the journal, \\"Acta Palaeontologica Polonica\\", is a central piece of data in the sentence. This tells us the name of the publication, crucial information for any further reference or study. It suggests that the journal is likely linked with Poland given the \\"Polonica\\" inclusion, indicating the origin or linguistic focus of the journal. 3. Abbreviation: The sentence provides the abbreviated title of the journal (\\"Acta Palaeontol. Pol.\\"), which can be used in bibliographic references where space is limited or to ensure quick recognition by readers familiar with the abbreviation. 4. Content Focus: The name of the journal suggests that its content primarily revolves around the science of Paleontology. The term \\"palaeontologica\\" points to this scientific discipline, indicating an academic focus on the history of life on Earth through the study of plant and animal fossils. 5. Language: Although the sentence does not directly provide this piece of data, we can infer that the language of the journal might be English because of the nomenclature and format used. Abbreviating the journal's title is a common practice in English academic publishing, and there is no direct reference to another language in the sentence. However, the word \\"Polonica\\" may suggest a link to Polish language or content, but this assumption requires further verification. In sum, the sentence may appear simple at first glance but reveals considerable information about the publication identity, regional origin, subject focus, abbreviated titling, and potentially the language of a widely recognised paleontological journal."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Metrosideros is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines mostly found in the Pacific region in the Myrtaceae family. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek \\"metra\\" or \\"heartwood\\" and \\"sideron\\" or \\"iron\\". Perhaps the best-known species are the phutukawa (\\"M. excelsa\\"), northern rt (\\"M. robusta\\"), and southern rt (\\"M. umbellata\\") of New Zealand, and \\"hia lehua\\", (\\"M. polymorpha\\"), from the Hawaiian Islands. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Myrtaceae is the myrtle family, a family of dicotyledonous plants placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, pohutukawa, the bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus all are members of this group. All species are woody, with essential oils, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One notable character of the family is that the phloem is located on both sides of the xylem, not just outside as in most other plants. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually with an entire (not toothed) margin. The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Buenos Aires is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \\"Buenos aires\\" can be translated as \\"fair winds\\" or \\"good airs\\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \\"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Corazón de Sudamérica\\" (\\"Heart of South America\\"). Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Paraguay is the smallest landlocked country in the Americas. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Metrosideros stipularis is a species of the myrtle family commonly known as tepú , trepú , or tepual . It is an evergreen tree or shrub that can attain a height of about seven metres . The plant is native to southern South America in the southern portions of Chile and Argentina and is a typical resident of very wet areas , especially peat bogs . Tepú has white flowers that emerge during the austral summer from January through March . The tree 's wood is used within its range as a firewood due to it high energy content . This species has often been placed in its own genus Tepualia , but recent works include it in Metrosideros \`\` WCSP '' .

This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. and the situation: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B. Answer the following question: When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B? Answer:","response":"The person likely had a lower core temperature during experiment B. When the scientist consumed hard liquor, it caused his blood vessels to dilate. This would have moved warm blood closer to the surface of the skin, causing a sensation of warmth. However, in -30 degree weather, this would also have allowed for easier heat exchange with the cold external environment, causing the core body temperature to decrease. Therefore, during experiment B, when the scientist consumed the alcoholic beverage, his core temperature would have dropped lower than during experiment A, where no alcohol was consumed."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What key details about david siradze can be extracted from the following bio?

Article: Most parents love the Internet and want their kids to use it. But a new survey in America finds almost as many also fear the online world--especially social networking sites such as My Space--and worry their kids will get in trouble with people they meet. \\"The parents see the web's incredible potential , and they know their kids have to be there.\\" says James Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, which released results from a survey that looked into parental attitudes toward the Internet. \\" is also what they are scared of most.\\" The study was conducted online May 5-10 by Insight Research Group. It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers. To young people, the benefits of giving out some personal information to reach out to friends outweigh the risks. And the study shows they are so comfortable with the medium that 78% have a personal website or blog. Parents also recognize the importance of the Internet. The survey shows 91% think the Net helps their children explore their passions, and 77% think the Internet is one of the most valuable education tools teens have. But 88% think it's important to know what their kids are doing online. Findings suggest both parents and teens need more education about using online media, Steyer says. Internet safety has become an increasing concern for parents in America. Organizations like the Non-profit Common Sense have been trying to reach and help parents pay attention to the problem. Question: Why do young people give out their personal information? Options: A: They think it has more advantages than disadvantages. B: They want to make themselves famous by doing that.

He was happy to be working because he had suffered from something during his illness. What did he suffer from? Options: - angst - sobering - boredom - painless - malaise reasoning:","response":"James suffered from boredom during his illness. Reasoning: - Angst refers to a feeling of deep anxiety or dread, and it's not directly related to illness or recovery. Although one might experience angst during sickness, it is not clearly stated in the given context. - Sobering refers to making or becoming more serious, sensible, or solemn. This term doesn't imply any suffering during illness. - Boredom is a likely option here, as it is common for people to feel bored during an extended period of sickness, especially if they are unable to engage in their regular activities. - Painless doesn't make sense in the context of suffering during an illness, as it implies a lack of pain or discomfort. - Malaise is a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or unease that could be related to sickness, but it doesn't specifically indicate what James suffered from during his illness. Moreover, malaise wouldn't necessarily make him happy to return to work. Considering these points, boredom is the most reasonable answer, since James was happy to return to work after his period of sickness, implying that he was likely unfulfilled or unstimulated during his time away from work."},{"question":"Write an email with the subject line \\"Bakersfield Environmental Action Items\\".","response":"Subject: Bakersfield Environmental Action Items Hello [Recipient's Name], I'm writing this email to tell you about some important things we can do to help our environment in Bakersfield.

What is the ingredient usually used to turn rice or curry yellow","response":"The ingredient typically used to turn rice or curry yellow is turmeric (Curcuma longa). Turmeric is a spice obtained from the rhizomes or roots of the turmeric plant, which is a member of the ginger family. It is native to Southeast Asia and has been widely used in various cuisines for centuries, particularly in Indian, Thai, and Middle Eastern dishes. Turmeric is well-known for its vibrant yellow color, which in fact comes from a naturally occurring chemical compound called curcumin. Curcumin is a pigment that imparts the characteristic yellow hue to dishes, including rice and curry, when it is used in small quantities. Its color also makes it a popular choice for natural food coloring. When used in rice dishes, turmeric adds not only a beautiful shade of yellow but also a subtle earthy and slightly bitter flavor. Many famous rice dishes, such as Indian Biryani or Spanish paella, use turmeric for color and taste. Turmeric can also be found in various curry recipes, either as a whole root or in ground form, typically combined with other spices like cumin, coriander, and chili powder. The spice blend gives curries their rich depth of flavor and color. To use turmeric in rice or curry, the following steps are usually followed: 1. Preparing the spice: If using whole turmeric root, wash it thoroughly and peel its outer skin. Use a grater or mortar and pestle to grate or crush it into a smooth paste. If using ground turmeric, measure out the required amount according to your recipe. 2. Preparing the dish: In a pan or pot over medium heat, sauté chopped onions, garlic, and any other aromatics you may be using. Then, add the turmeric and other spices, stirring well to combine. This process, known as \\"blooming,\\" helps release the aroma and flavor of the turmeric and spices. 3. Adding the main ingredients: If making rice, add the washed rice to the pan, stirring it to ensure that every grain is coated in the turmeric-infused oil. If making curry, add your choice of protein (such as chicken, beef, or tofu) or vegetables, cooking until they are well-coated in the spice mix. 4. Creating the sauce or cooking the rice: Add liquids depending on the dish. For curry, this may include crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, or stock. For rice, use an appropriate amount of water or stock depending on the type of rice you are using. Cook the dish according to the recipe instructions until the ingredients are well-cooked and the liquids are absorbed or thickened. Turmeric not only gives rice and curry dishes their signature yellow color, but it also offers various health benefits. Curcumin is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Moreover, it has been studied for its potential role in managing health conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. In conclusion, turmeric is the key ingredient used to give rice and curry dishes their appealing, distinctive yellow hue. Its unique color and flavor, along with its health benefits, have made it an essential spice in numerous cuisines worldwide."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: From now on, the work of the Council will consist of identifying, on this basis, the factors around which the European Council must formulate general directions.","response":"Step 1: Read the sentence and understand its meaning.

He found an interesting table that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two different times, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's climatic condition in the previous century. And, time B showed earth's climatic condition in the present century. Keith was amazed to see how the world has changed in just a century. and a hint : Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. Please answer this question : Which period would be more harmful for habitat of species, time A or time B? Answer:","response":"Time B would be more harmful for the habitat of species due to the increase in global temperature, global warming, and the extensive use of fossil fuels. These factors lead to the destruction of habitats, making it harder for species to adapt and survive."},{"question":"Does \\"Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"In what decade did film and literature help revive football in Britain?\\"","response":"Yes, the statement \\"Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s\\" provides the correct answer to the question, \\"In what decade did film and literature help revive football in Britain?.\\" The decade referred to in the statement is the 1990s. To elaborate, during the 1990s, football experienced a revival in Britain, which was significantly aided by the influence of film and literature. This period was marked by a change in the perception of the sport, transitioning from a primarily working-class pastime with a somewhat negative reputation due to hooliganism and violence in the 1980s, to a more socially inclusive and economically prosperous activity. Literature, including the publication mentioned in the statement, played an essential role in reflecting and influencing this transformation in British society. One example is the best-selling book \\"Fever Pitch\\" by Nick Hornby, published in 1992. This autobiographical work explored the life of a football fan, capturing the emotions and passion that the sport can generate in its supporters. Its success and popularity contributed to a shift in public attitudes towards the sport and its social value. Additionally, the world of film played an influential role in reviving football in Britain. Movies such as \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" (2002) and \\"The Damned United\\" (2009) portrayed various aspects of the sport and culture which help break down gender and class barriers. They showcased the tremendous impact football can have both on individual lives and larger communities, emphasizing its significance in British society. Moreover, the inauguration of the English Premier League in 1992 marked a turning point in the commercialization and globalization of football in Britain. The new league structure, lucrative broadcast deals, and influx of foreign talent contributed to the sport's growing popularity and appeal across various demographics. In conclusion, the statement does contain the correct answer to the question. Film and literature played a significant role in reviving football in Britain during the 1990s. The period was marked by changes in public perceptions and the sport's socio-economic status, attributable in part to the impact of these cultural mediums."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Prince George's County Public Schools system (PGCPS) is a large school district administered by the government of Prince George's County, Maryland, United States and is overseen by the Maryland State Department of Education.

As British Foreign Secretary, from 1812 he was central to the management of the coalition that defeated Napoleon and was the principal British diplomat at the Congress of Vienna. Castlereagh was also leader of the British House of Commons in the Liverpool government from 1812 until his suicide in August 1822. Early in his career, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, he was involved in putting down the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and was instrumental in securing the passage of the Irish Act of Union of 1800. Stewart had recurring health problems throughout his childhood, and his family elected to send him to The Royal School, Armagh, rather than to England for his secondary education. At the encouragement of Charles Pratt, first Earl of Camden, who took a great interest in him and treated him as a grandson by blood, he later attended St. John's College, Cambridge (1786-87), where he applied himself with greater diligence than expected from an aristocrat and obtained first class in his last examinations. He left Cambridge due to an extended illness, and after returning to Ireland did not pursue further formal education. In 1790, Stewart was elected as a Member of the Irish Parliament for Down in one of the most expensive elections in Irish history. Though for a time he was associated with the Northern Whig Club, he entered the Irish House of Commons as an Independent. He ran on a platform supporting Whig principles of electoral reform and opposing the Irish policies of the British Government. But even from the outset of his career, he was a personal supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. Stewart was a lifelong advocate of Catholic concessions, though his position on the specific issue of Catholic Emancipation varied depending on his assessment of the potential repercussions on other policy priorities. When war with France forced British Government attention on Ireland as a possible place of French invasion, the Irish Volunteers, seen as a potential source of disaffection, were disbanded by Dublin Castle, and a reorganised Militia was created in 1793. Stewart enrolled as an officer, a matter of course for a young Protestant aristocrat, and served as Lieutenant Colonel under the command of his wife's uncle, Thomas Conolly. Between Stewart's attendance to his militia duties, his pursuit of cultural, family and political interests in London, two trips to the Continent (in 1791, when he visited revolutionary Paris, and 1792), and the courtship of his wife whom he married in 1794, his life during this period was not centred on the activities of the Irish House of Commons, where he was listened to with respect but where he was not yet an important player. He was also beginning to disappoint some of his more radical original supporters in his constituency. As the French Revolution grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain. He became further inclined to support not only Pitt personally but the British Government, even when he did not approve of a specific line taken in Irish policy. In 1794, partly as a result of the promotion of Stewart's interests by his Camden connections, he was offered the Government-controlled seat of Tregony in Cornwall, where he was elected to the British House of Commons on a similar platform of reform principles and support for Pitt, on whose side he sat in Westminster. In 1796, he transferred to a seat for the Suffolk constituency of Orford, which was in the interest of his mother's family, the Seymour-Conways (Marquess of Hertford). What did he do after returning to Ireland?","response":"After returning to Ireland, Lord Castlereagh did not pursue further formal education.

The encyclical is subtitled \\"On the Unity of Human Society.\\" It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting \\"a tone\\" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as ideologies of racism, cultural superiority and the totalitarian state. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as \\"Mystici corporis Christi\\" (1943). The encyclical laments the destruction of Poland, denounces the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and calls for a restoration of independent Poland. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pope Saint Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, (2 June 1835 20 August 1914) was Pope from August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was canonized in 1954. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. He was born in the town of Riese, which would later append \\"Pio X\\" (Pius X's name in Italian) to the town's name. - The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII) Eugenio Pacelli on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date right up until the current day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they're required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 \\"Mit brennender Sorge\\" encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - The Secretary of State of His Holiness The Pope, commonly known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Holy See Secretariat of State, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City. - Luigi Maglione ( 2 March 1877 -- 23 August 1944 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death . Pius XII never replaced Maglione , opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself , with the assistance of two undersecretaries . - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945.

Even though the state is smaller than the country, it is better because the Available choices: -state has zero debt... -country has zero debt...","response":"Even though the state is smaller than the country, it is better because the state has zero debt. Zero debt indicates that the state has effectively managed its resources and maintained a stable, secure financial system. This is crucial as it presents numerous advantages over a country with debt, which can lead to negative consequences for its citizens. Firstly, having zero debt means the state can continue to invest in essential public services without being hindered by interest payments. This subsequently improves the quality of life for the residents within the state. Better infrastructure, such as roads, schools, hospitals, and public transport, can be built, maintained, and upgraded. This leads to a more prosperous region, which in turn fosters a thriving economy where businesses can flourish. Moreover, having zero debt allows the state more maneuverability within its budget. With no debt to service, the state can allocate funds towards pressing social issues, such as education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation, thereby ensuring a healthier, more educated population. This results in a more productive workforce, which is vital for economic growth. Furthermore, the state, being smaller in size compared to the country, has the advantage of being easier to manage and govern. This allows for more efficient decision-making and implementation of policies. The state's smaller size also gives it the ability to react to economic changes and challenges more promptly than the country, providing a more stable and secure financial landscape. In comparison, a country with debt can face numerous problems. High debt levels can lead to increased interest rates, which then places additional strain on public finances. This results in reduced government spending on crucial public services, negatively impacting the citizens' quality of life. Additionally, countries with large debts are often subject to external pressures and influences from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. These institutions may impose austerity measures that can further cut public spending, leading to sociopolitical instability and unrest as citizens struggle with fewer resources and less support. Also, countries with a massive debt burden are more likely to experience economic slowdowns as their debt consumes a significant portion of government expenditure. This leaves less room for investments that boost economic growth or respond to sudden crises. High debt levels can damage the country's credit rating, making it difficult and expensive to borrow funds in the future, which adds further strain to the nation's finances. In conclusion, the state's zero debt demonstrates its effective management of resources and financial stability, paving the way for a thriving economy, improved public services, and an enhanced overall quality of life. This is preferable to a country with debt, which faces numerous challenges and negative consequences for its citizens. The state's smaller size and zero debt further underscore its ability to be more agile and responsive to economic challenges and opportunities, making it a better choice for a prosperous future."},{"question":"Write an email with the subject line \\"European Reorganization\\".","response":"Subject: European Reorganization Hello friend!

Choose the sentence that goes against common sense. Options: - Sentence A: \\"He flew an airplane underground\\" - Sentence B: \\"He flew an airplane over the city\\"","response":"To answer this question, I will analyze each sentence and compare them against what we know about the nature of airplanes and their typical operation. Sentence A: \\"He flew an airplane underground\\" Airplanes are designed to fly in the air and rely on aerodynamics and lift to stay aloft. In addition, underground spaces are enclosed and typically not large enough for airplanes to operate. Flying an airplane underground goes against the basic principles of aviation, making it an implausible situation. Sentence B: \\"He flew an airplane over the city\\" Airplanes commonly transport passengers or goods over cities, as they are designed for aerial navigation and can cover vast distances. This scenario is consistent with the normal operation of airplanes and falls within the realm of common sense. Based on this analysis, it is clear that Sentence A (\\"He flew an airplane underground\\") goes against common sense."},{"question":"Use reasoning to lead to the answer of the following question: The person gave a good hands on what to show how to do the work?

Demonstration: A practical exhibition and explanation of how something works or how to perform an activity. This may include a hands-on approach, where someone shows how to do something in practice. 2. Garage: A shelter for a vehicle, usually a car. Garages could be a place for mechanics to work, but the word itself doesn't refer to the act of teaching or showing how to do something. 3. Building: A structure with walls and a roof, built for occupation or other purposes; a building doesn't necessarily show how to do something. 4. Barn: A large farm building used for storing grain, hay, or straw, or for housing livestock. Like a garage, a barn might be a setting for hands-on learning, but the word itself doesn't indicate the act of teaching or demonstrating. 5. Synagogue: A building where Jewish assembly or congregation meets for religious worship and instruction. Though synagogues provide instructional or educational activities, they are religious in context, making it an unlikely answer choice for this question. Considering the context of the question and the definitions of these words, the best option is: - Demonstration: This word refers to a practical exhibition and explanation of how something works or how to perform an activity – fitting the description provided perfectly.

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank.

We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort. Although I’m one of the few people in the developed world who does not watch Game of Thrones, my co-workers tell me this was one of the locations used for a scene in the show.

(E.g., Runners’ feet are trained to function as spring-like mechanism) B) The body should be injected with a substance that makes the bones unbreakable, and there will be no more injuries. Okay, little buddy, let's think about these two options and decide which one sounds better for keeping people safe while exercising or running. A) This option focuses on training the body to move in a way that helps protect itself from getting hurt. Like making the runner's feet act like springs to absorb the impact. This could be a good way to prevent injuries by teaching people how to move more safely. B) This option is about putting a special substance into the body that makes the bones super strong and unbreakable. While this might sound cool, it doesn't really help with learning how to move safely or preventing other non-bone related injuries. In terms of naive physics reasoning, option A is more sound because it focuses on helping people learn to move safely and prevent injuries from happening in the first place. Option B might protect bones, but it doesn't help with overall safe movement and injury prevention."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Sometimes, the best course of action is to hold an intervention. This way, your teen will be surrounded by loved ones sharing the untold consequences of your teen's actions. You can invite a former user to come and share their experience and discuss the dangers and risks of steroid use. The goal of an intervention is to get your teen to participate in treatment and realize the impact of their use. It's important to see if your teen has experienced any damage to their health. Some side-effects are reversible, so it's important to see what damage has been caused. Set up an appointment for a physical with your family doctor. Medications that target symptoms of withdrawal and antidepressants are commonly prescribed to kids who have been abusing steroids. Talk to your doctor about medications and whether or not they are a good choice for your child. There are many different types of therapy available to help kids with abuse problems. These can be individual meetings with a therapist, or you can schedule family therapy sessions. There are also in-home counselors available through substance abuse programs. A therapist can help your teen talk about their performance, anxieties, perfectionism, and coping strategies. Find a therapist by contacting your insurance provider or local mental health clinic. You can also get a recommendation from a physician or friend. Since people sometimes have another disorder along with drug addiction, try to find a therapist who specializes in co-occurring disorders. Some issues your teen may be facing could include self-esteem issues, depression, or anxiety. Your teen may be using steroids to help them cope with these issues. A therapist trained to work with co-occurring disorders will help your teen through all of their issues at once. Some teens will need to enter a program to handle their abuse. Find a substance abuse treatment program that admits teens who struggle with steroid use. Often, substance abuse programs are residential, although there may be some day treatment or weekly options available, based on your teen's needs. Within the USA, go to http://www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov to learn about treatment options. Summary:","response":"An intervention can help a teen using steroids by having loved ones and a former user discuss the dangers, encouraging them to get treatment, seeing a doctor for health check and medications, finding a therapist, and possibly joining a substance abuse program."},{"question":"Can I get pregnant on the first day of my period? Can I be pregnant even after having a period? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: A). no. B). yes.","response":"To answer these questions, we'll break down each one into its separate components. Question 1: Can I get pregnant on the first day of my period? Pregnancy occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg. During a menstrual period, the chances of becoming pregnant are low, but not impossible. The probability of pregnancy depends on various factors, such as the length of your menstrual cycle, the timing of ovulation, and the presence of sperm. Although it is unlikely, it is still possible to get pregnant on the first day of your period if ovulation occurs early in the cycle and viable sperm is present. Question 2: Can I be pregnant even after having a period? In some cases, women may experience light bleeding during early pregnancy, which can be mistaken for a period. In other situations, women continue to have regular periods during their pregnancy, although this is less common. So technically, you can be pregnant even after having what seems like a period. To confirm a pregnancy, it's always recommended to take a pregnancy test and consult a healthcare professional. Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Now let's compare the two questions. The first question asks about the likelihood of getting pregnant on the first day of the period, while the second question asks about the possibility of being pregnant even after having a period. Considering the different phrasings and focus of each question, the answer to the multiple-choice problem would be: A). no."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Is this product review positive?

Answer:","response":"The last step of the process after the pancreas produces the hormones insulin and glucagon is the regulation of blood sugar levels. Insulin and glucagon work together to maintain a balance in the glucose levels in the bloodstream. Insulin helps to lower blood sugar levels when elevated, mainly by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells throughout the body, especially muscle cells and liver cells. Glucose is then either utilized as an immediate source of energy or stored as glycogen for future use. On the other hand, glucagon raises blood sugar levels when they are too low, by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This ensures that the body has a constant supply of energy and prevents hypoglycemia. In summary, the last step of the process is the maintenance of balanced blood sugar levels through the actions of insulin and glucagon, ensuring that the body has a stable and appropriate supply of energy based on its needs."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person whose analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment? In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea, and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.The collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology professor from the University of Missouri, completed an analysis of sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi) from the Chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site, while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as \\"rather hyper-inflated\\" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits. The answer is:","response":"Ken MacLeod. To extract the answer, I followed these steps: 1.

In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone . He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition : \`\` ( It ) strikes the eye from afar . The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life . '' - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Answer:","response":"He has spent a lot of time doing research."},{"question":"Information: - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Andinichthyidae is a prehistoric family of catfishes from the Cretaceous of South America . - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).

The camera slowly pans down where stargazers and amateur astronomers are gathered with telescopes. Among these are students and faculty of the Lee High School Astronomy Club. Two students at this club are Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend, Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski). As they look through their telescopes at the stars, Leo innocently asks Sarah about another male student who invited her to a student party.Leo and Sarah's teacher, Mr. Perry (Mike O'Malley) comes up and quizzes them about some of the brighter stars. Leo correctly identifies the stars Mizar and Alcor, but cannot name a somewhat smaller, dimmer star a bit south of the other two, although he is sure that it is not the star Megrez, as Sarah claims. Mr. Perry, thinking it might be a satellite, suggests they take a photograph and send it to Dr. Wolf, a professional astronomer who sponsors the Lee High School Astronomy club. As Perry walks away, Leo and Sarah get into a brief, teasing argument about whether the unidentified star is Megrez.Dr. Marcus Wolf (Charles Martin Smith, uncredited) arrives for work at the Adrian Peak observatory in Tuscon, Arizona. Seating himself at his work station, he finds the packet sent him by Leo, containing a photograph of the unknown star near Mizar and Alcor, and a cover letter asking him to identify it. Punching the stellar coordinates into his computer, he sees it is an uncharted object. His observatory's telescopes zooming in on it, he sees it is in fact a comet. Curious about it, he directs his computer to analyze the comet's position and calculate its trajectory. As the numbers begin to scroll through the screen, Dr. Wolf's curious expression fades into a look of severe worry and concern.

Rosberg claims that his Mercedes team-mate has been 'making some mistakes' recently. 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points. 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points. Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. The Brit must finish first or second at Yas Marina, where the final grand prix carries double points, to be certain of taking the title.

What impact would this have had on his health, asks Harry Low. The western lowland silverback left his den through an unlocked door and entered the zookeepers' enclosure, where he seized his chance to drink something sweet - lots of it. He would have been more familiar with the diluted version of the drink, which forms part of the gorillas' daily diet, according to a spokeswoman for the zoo, along with cold fruit tea and leafy greens such as cabbage and kale. They are also fed other fresh vegetables including broccoli, carrots and cucumber. Gorillas have quite large stomachs so this epic helping of concentrated squash could have caused severe stomach pains and diarrhoea, according to Prof Phyllis Lee, a primatologist at the University of Stirling. \\"Five litres is quite a lot for a gorilla to consume in one go but given a gorilla's manual dexterity, I would assume that some would have been spilled,\\" she says. \\"He must have found it and taken his opportunity, similar to how a four-year-old child would.\\" Lee added that she would expect the squash to affect the consistency of Kumbuka's poo rather than its colour - even in the case of blackcurrant - though she added that she had not studied the matter closely. Image copyright PA Image caption Kumbuka succeeded in opening the bottle but may have spilled some of its contents But what about the effect of the sugar? Might this have caused a surge of physical activity once the effect of the tranquilliser had worn off? Apparently not in this case. \\"Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about,\\" according to Prof David Field, who carried out a report into last week's incident. Had a human drunk five litres of undiluted squash, the results would have been similar, but possibly more extreme. It would be almost impossible for a human to take that much squash on, according to dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker. \\"I would imagine it would lead to a very upset tummy and disrupt the digestive tract,\\" she says. Diarrhoea and sickness would be the main symptoms, she suggests, though they would not last too long. \\"It wouldn't cause lasting damage - maybe you'd feel the effects for a day.\\" According to Phyllis Lee, Kumbuka's size - he weighs 29 stone (184kg) - would have helped him cope with his squash-drinking binge. There would have been no danger of overdosing on vitamin C, she says, and no damage to the teeth from just one episode of this kind. \\"That would only be caused by continually consuming sugary drinks.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Professor David Field, the zoological director at Londonzoo explained to BBC Radio 4's PM programme what Kumbuka did with his freedom.

As the first part of our investigation concludes, I’m keen to use this opportunity to clarify some things. The results of this initial investigation have established that the gorilla dens are sound and fit for purpose. For a Zoological Director running a zoo responsible for thousands of animals and hundreds of staff, this kind of reassurance matters. I can certainly tell you that there were no broken locks, Kumbuka did not smash any windows, he was never ‘on the loose’, and his normal gorilla posturing reported by visitors earlier in the day was unrelated to the incident. What I will tell you is what happened, according to those who were actually there. Kumbuka was called into his private night quarters for his dinner at around 5.10pm on Thursday 13th October. As a big silverback male with a matching appetite, he eats separately from the females - otherwise they wouldn’t get a look in. Unfortunately the door to his den had not been properly secured and a secondary security door had not yet been locked. We’ve since established that Kumbuka made an opportunistic escape from his unlocked den into the staff-only service corridor where a zookeeper was working. Thanks to the incredibly close bond and relationship shared by the zookeeper and Kumbuka, the zookeeper was able to continually reassure Kumbuka, talking to him calmly and in the same light-hearted tone he would always use, as he removed himself from the area. Staff raised the alarm that triggered our standard escape response, while Kumbuka briefly explored the zookeeper area next door to his den, where he opened and drank five litres of undiluted blackcurrant squash. Kumbuka was immediately contained in the non-public area by quick-thinking zookeepers responding to the alarm, where he was tranquilised and moved back into his den. Video of Gorillas enjoy foraging for Autumn treats Any breach of our security protocols is incredibly serious, but the incident itself was less dramatic than some would have you believe. Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about. The professional responses of our zookeepers, our security teams and the emergency services was exemplary and thanks to the zookeepers’ strong relationship with Kumbuka they were able to reassure him during the incident. Now that the initial facts have been established, it’s our job to understand any contributing factors that allowed an experienced and highly trained zookeeper to make a mistake with the doors. I myself started life as a volunteer zookeeper in 1980, caring for gorillas and chimpanzees. Those of us who have had the privilege of caring for great apes become quickly aware of their individual characters and tailor our care to account for each of their personality traits. Kumbuka is the alpha male in our gorilla troop at ZSL London Zoo, an impressive male in both stature and character. Kumbuka has fathered two infants and is a patient and protective father, who displays typical silverback behaviour, such as beating his chest and posturing. Gorilla Kingdom is his home and territory and as his family grows, so will Kumbuka’s naturally protective instincts. I have the utmost respect for Kumbuka and the gorilla troop – a respect that I know is shared by all of my zookeeper colleagues, who also recognise the important responsibility they have in caring for them. The magnitude of personal responsibility that zookeepers feel for the animals in their care, the colleagues they work with every day and the thousands of visitors to their zoo is indescribable. It is this sense of responsibility that provides some of our strongest security measures. We know that humans sometimes make mistakes, but these are rare. We also know that automating every security system poses a greater risk of mechanical failure, and could lead to an over-reliance on technology that will create the kind of complacency that has no place here. We will continue to work with our keeping teams to identify any adjustments or modifications that can help avoid any repeat mistake in future, but ultimately our trust in our people is not shaken. Today, Kumbuka and his family are happily playing, eating and sleeping in Gorilla Kingdom. Gorillas invoke the most remarkable feelings of wonder from anyone who sees them and our visitors can continue to be assured that these animals are safe, secure and in the care of a team of dedicated zookeepers. ||||| Fruit-flavoured squash before and after being mixed with water Squash (also known as cordial), in British English, is a non-alcoholic concentrated syrup used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and sugar or a sugar substitute. Modern squashes may also contain food colouring and additional flavouring. Some traditional squashes contain herbal extracts, most notably elderflower and ginger. Drinks [ edit ] Squash is mixed with a certain amount of water or carbonated water before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a drink mixer, it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a cocktail. Citrus fruits (particularly orange, lime and lemon) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.[1] Traditional squashes are usually flavoured with ginger, chokeberries (often with spices added), elderflower, and sometimes orange or lemon.[citation needed] Preparation [ edit ] Squash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water (carbonated or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are made with two parts concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water. Storage [ edit ] Most cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators. Ingredients [ edit ] Ingredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings. Flavourings [ edit ] Traditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry. Modern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon. Terminology [ edit ] \\"Cordial\\", \\"diluted juice\\", and \\"squash\\" are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended.[citation needed] In British English, \\"cordial\\" refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup).[2] \\"High juice\\" is not a brand of squash but rather a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%. Squash is often colloquially known as \\"juice\\". However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called \\"fruit drink\\", especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., Fruit Shoot). Some small areas in the North East refer to squash as \\"dilutey juice\\". Fruit juice content [ edit ] Squashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as \\"high juice\\", and squashes are quite often called \\"juice\\" when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5-10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state \\"with real fruit juice\\" on the label. Low-sugar squashes [ edit ] Squashes labelled \\"no added sugar\\" are artificially sweetened, usually with aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharin or sucralose, which is much cheaper for the manufacturers than both HFCS and natural sugar. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They tend to be very low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, ethyl methylphenylglycidate for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, allyl hexanoate for pineapple etc.) to make up for the lack of fruit juice taste. World markets [ edit ] Assorted bottles of squash at a grocery store in Argentina Britvic (under the Robinsons, MiWadi and Teisseire brands), Hamdard (under the Rooh Afza brand in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), Nichols (under the Vimto brand), Suntory (under the Ribena brand) and Coca-Cola (under the Kia-Ora brand). Australian brands include Cottee's, Bickford's, P&N Beverages and Golden Circle cordials. Indian brands include Kissan and Rasna. In Israel, fruit squashes are produced by such companies as Prigat. Animal consumption [ edit ] The gorillas at London Zoo are given both squash and cold fruit tea to drink.

However, for the sake of accommodating your request, here is a brief sentence: \\"The sun rises in the east.\\" Now, let me elaborate on the statement to provide a more detailed and long answer: The sun, a massive entity at the center of our solar system, is responsible for providing the planet Earth with light, heat, and energy necessary for sustaining life. Due to the Earth's axial tilt of 23.5 degrees and constant rotation along an imaginary line called the axis, we experience the natural phenomena of day and night, as well as the changing seasons. The sun appears to rise in the east because of the direction of Earth's rotation, which is from west to east. As Earth rotates, different parts of its surface face the sun, leading to the perception of sunrise and sunset. The rotation of Earth on its axis takes approximately 24 hours, causing the sun to appear in different positions throughout the day, reaching its highest point in the sky around noon and gradually descending, ultimately disappearing below the western horizon at sunset. In the morning, the sun's rays pass through Earth's atmosphere at a more oblique angle than at midday, which is why sunrises often exhibit vibrant colors. As the sun's light travels a longer distance through the atmosphere to reach our eyes, the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet light) get scattered more, leaving the longer wavelengths (red and orange light) to dominate the skies. This phenomenon, known as Rayleigh Scattering, results in the beautiful, warm colors we associate with sunrises and sunsets. While the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west for most locations on Earth, it's worth noting that its perceived path is slightly different depending on where one is situated during varying times of the year. For instance, at the equator, the sun rises almost directly from the east and sets in the west. However, as one moves further north or south, the sun appears to rise and set more towards the southeast and northwest or southwest and northeast, following a curved path. This variation is particularly noticeable during the solstices and equinoxes, when the sun's position is at specific points relative to Earth's orbit around it. In conclusion, the statement \\"The sun rises in the east\\" broadly describes the natural event of sunrise as observed from most locations on our planet. This intricate dance between Earth's rotation and the position of the sun in the sky are integral to the daily rhythms of life and have been deeply etched into human culture, symbolism, and navigational techniques for millennia."},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: Numerous men from Detroit volunteered to fight for the Union during the American Civil War, including the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary Iron Brigade), which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.

The World Heritage designation is awarded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to places that have cultural, historical, or natural significance and are considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. The Champagne region is highly valued for its unique and rich history, as well as its cultural and economic significance. The region is known for its vineyards, which produce the world-famous Champagne wine. This sparkling wine is distinguished by the unique method used to make it, known as the méthode champenoise, which involves a secondary fermentation process that takes place within the bottle. This technique is responsible for the wine's effervescence and is a key reason why Champagne has become an iconic and sought-after luxury item. One of the main factors that make the region worthy of the World Heritage designation is the long and fascinating history behind the production of Champagne wine. The origins of winemaking in the region date back to the Roman era, and the production of sparkling wine began to take shape in the 17th century. It was during this time that the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon played a crucial role in perfecting many of the techniques that are still utilized today in the production of Champagne. His work led to the development of a clear, sparkling wine that became highly demanded by the French nobility and other elites throughout Europe. Another factor contributing to the significance of the Champagne region is its cultural importance, which has grown over the centuries. Champagne has become synonymous with celebrations, important events, and the enjoyment of life. It is a symbol of elegance, refinement, and prosperity and has played a central role as a status symbol in numerous artistic and cultural expressions, including movies, literature, and high-society events. In addition to its historical and cultural value, the Champagne region boasts stunning landscapes and architectural heritage. The gently rolling hills covered with vineyards, the unique, chalky soils, and the intricate network of cellars and tunnels located beneath the region's towns and cities are all part of what makes the Champagne region so exceptional. These tunnels, some of which date back to the Roman period, serve as safe and stable storage for millions of bottles of Champagne, ensuring that they age properly and maintain their quality over time. Given these factors, the decision to designate the Champagne region as a World Heritage site is understandable, as it recognizes and preserves the unique history, culture, and beauty of the region. This designation not only promotes the distinctive character of the area and its wines but also encourages sustainable tourism and responsible development in the region. In conclusion, the Champagne region's World Heritage status is a testament to the valuable contribution that this area has made, and continues to make, to the world's cultural and gastronomic heritage."},{"question":"I got a question for you: Following the revelation that Ava had in fact murdered Connie Falconeri (Kelly Sullivan), head writer Ron Carlivati opened up to Michael Logan of TV Guide about the revelation, and whether or not he felt he had turned Ava into a cold-blooded killer.

But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. But I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. What is an answer for this question: Where people are less at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland?","response":"Based on the background information provided, people in coastal areas are less at risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency. This is because they naturally get more iodide from food items found in those regions, such as seaweed and saltwater fish, as well as higher iodine levels in the soil. These natural sources of iodine contribute to their dietary intake, helping to maintain proper thyroid gland function and prevent developmental difficulties associated with iodine deficiency, including mental retardation. In contrast, people living in inland areas are at a higher risk of iodine deficiency-related issues such as mental retardation, since the soil in these regions lacks the necessary iodine. This means that it is less likely to be naturally present in the diet of those living far from the coast. To mitigate this risk, iodized salt was developed and introduced to provide a simple means for increasing iodide intake, thus helping to prevent iodine deficiency-related health problems in populations residing far from coastal regions."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane.

Consumers are asked to provide a credit card to pay shipping and handling charges, but begin almost immediately receiving 80 to 90 monthly charges. Thousands of consumers have had trouble stopping those charges once they canceled the free trial offer. Acai (pronounced a-sigh-EE) comes in a number of forms including juice, pulp, powder and capsule. The berry has been touted as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and an antibacterial. The fruit is said to contain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential to human health. Claims of weight loss are unfounded, said the CSPI. \\"There's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that acai pills will help shed pounds, flatten tummies, cleanse colon, enhance sexual desire, or perform any of the other commonly advertised functions,\\" according to the organization's press release. Acai's popularity has surged on bogus marketing claims, said Jonny Bowden, a certified nutrition specialist and author of several health books. \\"Virtually every berry -- blueberry, strawberry, goji, acai -- are anti-inflammatory and high in antioxidants,\\" Bowden said. \\"This particular one is exotic. It's found in Brazil. It's been marketed to have more of a magic ingredient. It's been over-hyped and marketed to death. There are claims to curing cancer, curing baldness that is all over the place.\\" Like most berries, acai has good nutritional qualities, but \\"there is not a drop of research\\" that supports marketing claims that it prevents weight gain and facial wrinkles, Bowden said. Acai juices sell for as much as 40 per bottle. \\"The expensive acai berry is triumph of marketing over science, that's the bottom line,\\" Bowden said. \\"It's not useless, but it's not anything that people are claiming it is.\\" Companies including FWM Laboratories of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Hollywood, Florida, Advanced Wellness Research of Miami Beach, Florida, and other acai companies are accused of using fake diet blogs to steer consumers to sites plugging the free trials. After a doctor listed acai as a healthy food on the Oprah Winfrey show last year, and a guest on Rachael Ray's cooking show mentioned the fruit, ads popped up directing consumers to sites selling acai weight loss products as if endorsed by the celebrities. Winfrey and Ray have publicly disassociated themselves from those sites. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigating numerous complaints and said a lawsuit against FWM Laboratories is very likely. According to the Better Business Bureau, FWM Laboratories received an F rating, the BBB's worst. Other acai companies with the BBB''s F rating include Advanced Wellness Research, AcaiBurn, FX Supplements and SFL Nutrition. \\"There are no magical berries from the Brazilian rain forest that cure obesity, only painfully real credit card charges and empty weight loss promises,\\" Blumenthal said. \\"Aggressive acai berry pitches on the Internet entice countless consumers into free trials promising weight loss, energy and detoxification. These claims are based on folklore, traditional remedies and outright fabrications unproved by real scientific evidence.\\" Keri Gans, dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, recommends that customers turn to fruits and vegetables at their local produce markets. \\"If you're going on the Internet to find them and paying shipping fees, you should go to a market and buy local vegetables and fruits,\\" she said. \\"It'd be a lot less expensive.\\" Acai berries could be part of a well-balanced diet of different fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Gans said consumers should be skeptical whenever any one food seems too good to be true and should not rely on one \\"miracle food\\" to boost health. \\"If [people] hope to find answers in one food for longevity, I would say they're mistaken,\\" she said.

Acai fruit is said to contain good nutrients like Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, but there is no science or research that proves it can help people lose weight or cure health problems. It is a good idea for people to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains as part of a healthy diet, but they should remember that there is no one \\"miracle food\\" that can do everything to make them healthy."},{"question":"Add punctuation: The plane leaves without letting me have","response":"The plane leaves, without letting me have."},{"question":"Question: Voisin 1907 biplane - The 1907 Voisin biplane (designated the Voisin II by Jane's All the World's Aircraft) was the first successful powered aircraft designed by aeronautical engineer and manufacturer Gabriel Voisin.

In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra's right to call itself \\"Royal\\" could be withdrawn. Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors, including Rudolf Kempe, Antal Dorati, Andre Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy, and most recently Charles Dutoit. From the RPO's earliest days to the end of Beecham's life, they made numerous recordings for His Master's Voice, CBS and RCA. Among the works they recorded EMI chose several to be reissued at the end of the twentieth century in its \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\" series. They included a Delius programme; a Grieg programme; French ballet music; short works by Bizet, Chabrier, Faure and Saint-Saens; Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 4 and Nutcracker Suite; Mozart's Jupiter Symphony, Clarinet Concerto (Brymer) and Bassoon Concerto (Brooke); and Schubert's 3rd, 5th and 6th Symphonies. After Beecham's death the orchestra made many recordings for Decca, sometimes under pseudonyms such as the \\"Beecham Symphony Orchestra\\", the \\"London Festival Orchestra\\" and the \\"Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra\\". Among the conductors with whom the RPO recorded in the 1960s were Sir John Barbirolli, Fritz Reiner, Charles Munch, Georges Pretre, Kempe, Previn and Stokowski. Soloists included Earl Wild, Shura Cherkassky, Alan Civil and Luciano Pavarotti. Igor Stravinsky recorded his opera The Rake's Progress with the RPO in 1964. Colin Davis made some of his earliest recordings with the orchestra, including Mozart and Rossini overtures, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, and Stravinsky's Oedipus rex. From 1964 to 1979 the RPO was engaged by Decca to record Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The orchestra has also recorded for Deutsche Grammophon, Lyrita, Philips, Pye and Unicorn-Kanchana. In 1986, the orchestra launched RPO Records, claimed to be \\"the world's first record label to be owned by a symphony orchestra\\". Recordings available on the RPO label in 2013 ranged from core symphonic repertoire and Tchaikovsky ballet scores to film music by various composers, light music by Burt Bacharach and Richard Rodgers, and an album called \\"Symphonic Rock\\", described as \\"Over 3 hours of classic rock anthems and pop tracks with an orchestral twist\\".

So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors -- or doesn't it? While such vigilant tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it's important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing. In many cases, screening can lead to additional biopsies and surgeries to remove cancer, which can cause side effects, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not pose serious health problems in patients' remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so ingrained that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a riotous reaction among doctors, patients and advocacy groups. It's hard to uproot deeply held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or prior personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the remainder, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy . A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening- especially considering the explosion of the elderly that will soon swell our population. It's not an easy calculation to make, but one that make sense for the whole patient. Dr. Otis Brawley said, \\"Many doctors are ordering these tests purely to cover themselves.

However, in recent years, there have been debates on whether to routinely screen all women, especially those under 50 and over 74. The answer is not a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" as it ultimately depends on factors like age, risk assessment, and personal medical history. While screening is beneficial for many adult women, guidelines and recommendations have become increasingly nuanced to balance the risks and benefits of routine testing."},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1988 in Huntington Beach, California and currently recording for Rude Records/Bird Attack Records. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP. In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file. Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in.

He often worked the night shift. One day, he saw a raccoon in the mall. He stared at it for hours until it left. What happened next?","response":"After the raccoon had finally left the mall, Ryan couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to the raccoon than met the eye. Its presence in the mall was unusual, and it seemed quite intelligent. For the next few days, Ryan couldn't stop himself from thinking about the raccoon. He started to keep an extra lookout for the creature during his nightly patrols. In the meantime, Ryan decided to do some research to learn more about raccoons and see if he could find any reason behind the animal's appearance in the mall. His investigation led him to various facts about raccoons, their habits, and their behavior. He learned that raccoons are nocturnal creatures, that they are resourceful, and they have highly capable hands that can manipulate objects almost as well as humans. He also discovered that raccoons are known to travel several miles away from their dens in search of food. His newfound knowledge made Ryan all the more curious about the raccoon that he had seen in the mall that night. One evening, while on his break, Ryan decided to speak to his coworker and friend, Samantha. He shared his experience with her and the research he had done. Samantha, an animal enthusiast, was fascinated by the story and couldn't help but suggest that there might be more to this raccoon than Ryan had initially realized. Intrigued by the possibility of unraveling an interesting story, Ryan and Samantha agreed to spend some of their free nights on stake-outs around the closed mall, watching for the mysterious raccoon to make a return appearance. While this was definitely outside their normal range of duties, they were convinced that this raccoon was something special. After several nights of stake-outs, they finally spotted the raccoon once again entering the mall through a malfunctioning door that didn't close properly. They followed it from a distance, being extra cautious so as not to scare it off. The raccoon seemed to have developed a routine and had learned to navigate the corridors and security cameras with ease. To Ryan and Samantha's surprise, they noticed the raccoon stealthily making its way to the food court, where it skillfully opened and inspected the waste bins for any leftovers. It appeared that this raccoon had discovered the mall as a source of food, and was taking advantage of the plethora of discarded snacks and treats. Upon witnessing this, Ryan and Samantha couldn't help but feel sympathy for the creature. They realized that the raccoon was likely struggling to find food in its natural habitat due to urbanization, and it had somehow stumbled upon the mall as a substitute source. Feeling a responsibility to help, they decided to approach their supervisor with this information and a plan of action. With some convincing, Ryan and Samantha managed to get their supervisor on board to contact the local animal welfare organization and request help in capturing and relocating the raccoon to a more suitable environment. The supervisor also committed to address the malfunctioning door to prevent future incidents. The animal welfare organization, moved by their dedication, managed to successfully capture and relocate the raccoon to a wildlife sanctuary, where it could live safely and find ample food without having to venture into human territory. Ryan and Samantha received recognition from their team and the animal welfare organization for their commitment to not only their job but also their kindness towards this innocent creature.

The preceding sentence describes the dog beginning to mess with a person and a woman placing her dog on the ground, all in an effort to pass time. It presents a scene of these characters currently engaged in idle or recreational activities. Considering this, the correct choice should maintain and progress this theme. (a). , the men walk in and out of frame. - This doesn't seem to relate directly to the previous activities, and it shifts the attention to men who have not been discussed in the preceding sections of the story. (b). , the man grabs a newspaper to read as the woman begins drinking out of a bottle while two people come to get them. - This choice appears to shift the narrative from the activities involving the dogs to what the man and woman are doing, potentially breaking the flow of the story. (d). the lady grabs the dog's foot and use it to dig her deeper in the sand. - This choice is contextually inappropriate as it seems to introduce a less benign or potentially harmful activity for the dog. (c). , the dog does small tricks with the older guy's hands. - This maintains the focus on the dogs' actions and introduces an entertaining element which is consistent with the concept of \\"passing time.\\" So, after reflecting, I would choose (c) as the best option to add as the next sentence in the paragraph. It not only maintains the engagement with the dog but also introduces a new, fitting detail that aligns with the current context of the paragraph.

Midway, the girl lets loose with a series of piercing screams, panicking the audience and some nearby adults who rush up and open the box. The girl is just pretending to be hurt and smiles up at the adult man professing \\"I'm going to be an actress\\" before he slaps her.The movie cuts to a generic Hollywood beautiful person party where we see Harry (Robert Downey Jr.), fully but shabbily clothed, intentionally teetering at the edge of a pool full of bikini clad women. At this point the narrator (Harry) introduces himself and apologizes, somewhat defensively, for not being very good. \\"Do you see any other narrators?\\" he asks. (The movie repeatedly revisits the idea that the narrator isn't a trustworthy source. The symbolism is that the pool represents the Hollywood lifestyle and he's trying to decide whether to jump in or not). He (as the narrator) asks us if we want to know how he got here.We now cut to a small toy store late at night. Two thieves are rummaging around. One of them, Harry, is on the phone with his niece as she describes the action figure (\\"CyberCop\\") she wants for Christmas. Harry pretends that the store is open and he's on a regular shopping expedition, but his niece isn't buying it (it's too late at night). A large UPS truck drives by, jostling the wiring on the jury rigged alarm and setting it off. The two run out the back door and into an alley, where they are fired upon by a woman on a fire escape.

Options: (a). be prepared to eat; (b). eat until he vomits food; (c). not make too much noise chewing;","response":"To determine what Cameron will want to do next, let's analyze each option step-by-step: Option (a). be prepared to eat: - Since Cameron brought his lunch to a picnic in a park, it's reasonable to assume that he went there to enjoy the meal. Being prepared to eat fits with the context of having a picnic, and it aligns with Cameron's actions. Option (b). eat until he vomits food: - It is unlikely that Cameron would want to eat to the point of vomiting, as this would be uncomfortable and unpleasant. Generally, people eat meals with the intention of satisfying their hunger and enjoying the food, not overeating to the point of sickness. Option (c). not make too much noise chewing: - This option can be a goal while eating, as some people may want to be conscious of the noise they make while chewing their food. However, it is not necessarily the primary goal or the next step Cameron would take after bringing his lunch to the park. Based on analysis, it's reasonable to say that Cameron will likely choose option (a) - to be prepared to eat. This is because it fits with the context of having a picnic and aligns with his primary goal: to eat his lunch while enjoying the park."},{"question":"What common mineral is formed by the fossilization of vegetation? What is the answer?","response":"The common mineral formed by the fossilization of vegetation is coal. Coal is an organic sedimentary rock primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, as well as small amounts of sulfur and other elements. It is created through a complex process called coalification, which involves the transformation of plant material into the solid, black and combustible substance known as coal. Coal formation begins when large amounts of plant material, such as trees, ferns, and other vegetation, accumulate in swampy, low-oxygen environments known as peatlands or mires. In these damp conditions, the plant material does not fully decompose and instead accumulates as peat. Over time, the accumulated peat is buried by sediment, such as sand or clay, which helps to protect it from complete destruction by microbes and atmospheric oxygen. As more layers of sediment are deposited on top of the peat, it is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature. These conditions cause the peat to undergo a series of chemical and physical changes, which drive off volatile substances like water and methane and leave behind a carbon-rich substance. Gradually, the peat turns into lignite, also known as brown coal, which is a low-quality coal with a high moisture and ash content. With continued pressure and increased temperature over millions of years, the lignite undergoes further transformation, becoming sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and finally anthracite coal. Each stage of transformation results in a coal type with higher carbon content, energy density, and overall quality. However, it is important to note that not all peat deposits progress through each stage of coalification, as the process is heavily dependent on specific environmental conditions, such as the type of plant material, temperature, and pressure. Coal has played a significant role in human history, as it was one of the first fossil fuels utilized for energy production. It fueled the industrial revolution and continues to be an important energy source globally, particularly for electricity generation. The combustion of coal releases energy in the form of heat, which can then be used to turn water into steam and drive turbines in power plants. However, the use of coal as an energy source has also had significant negative effects, as burning coal releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These emissions contribute to climate change, acid rain, and air pollution, which have negative impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the environment. As a result, there has been a growing push for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, to minimize the detrimental effects of fossil fuel consumption. In summary, the common mineral formed by the fossilization of vegetation is coal. This organic sedimentary rock is created through the accumulation and transformation of plant material under specific environmental conditions. Coal has been crucial for human civilization as an energy source, but its use has also led to various negative environmental and health impacts, prompting a quest for cleaner and more sustainable energy alternatives."},{"question":"Question: What can larger mutations be caused by?

Evers was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, the third of the five children (including older brother Charles Evers) of Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm and James also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, eventually earning his high school diploma. Medgar Evers lived with the constant threat of death. A large Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist population were present in Jackson and its suburbs. The risk was so high that before his death, Evers and his wife Myrlie had trained their children on what to do in case of a shooting, bombing or other kind of attack on their lives. Evers, who was regularly followed home by at least two FBI cars and one police car, arrived at his home on the morning of his death without an escort. None of his usual protection was present, for reasons unspecified by the FBI or local police. Many believe that many members of the police force at the time were members of the Klan. In the early morning of June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's nationally televised Civil Rights Address, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. Evers's family had worried for his safety the day of his assassination and Evers himself had warned his wife that he felt himself in a greater danger than usual. When he arrived home, Evers's family was waiting for him and his children exclaimed to his wife, Myrlie, that he had arrived. Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read \\"Jim Crow Must Go\\", Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet ripped through his heart. Initially thrown to the ground by the impact of the shot, Evers rose and staggered 30 feet (10 meters) before collapsing. His wife Myrlie was the first to find him outside of their front door. He was taken to the local hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was initially refused entry because of his race. His family explained who he was and he was admitted; he died in the hospital 50 minutes later. Evers was the first African American to be admitted to an all-white hospital in Mississippi, a questionable achievement for the dying activist. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000. After Evers was assassinated, an estimated 5,000 people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Allen Johnson, Reverend Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders led the procession. The Mississippi police came prepared with riot gear and rifles in case the protests turned violent. While tensions were initially high in the stand off between police and marchers, both in Jackson and in many similar marches around the state, leaders of the movement maintained nonviolence among their followers.","response":"This text is about Medgar Evers, who was an African American civil rights activist from Mississippi.

A. send email B. talk with people C. ring up the president of bermuda D. think E. speak to The best answer is Answer:","response":"The best answer is D. think. Effective communication within a team is crucial for achieving success and reaching set goals. When team members are able to communicate effectively, they develop a deep understanding of each other's thought processes, strengths, and weaknesses. This mutual understanding allows the team to anticipate and predict what their teammates are likely to think or do in a given situation. To elaborate, let's take a look at the given options: A. Send an email: Although email is a popular communication tool, it does not necessarily represent effective communication. Being able to send an email does not mean that the team members understand each other's thoughts. B. Talk with people: Talking with people certainly is a part of communication, but being adept at conversation does not guarantee effective communication within a team. True teamwork involves more than just engaging in conversation; it requires the ability to connect and collaborate. C. Ring up the president of Bermuda: This option is irrelevant to the question and does not represent any aspect of effective communication within a team. D. Think: (The best answer) Effective communication allows team members to understand each other's thought processes. When a team communicates well, they are able to anticipate what their teammates are likely to think and respond accordingly. This leads to better decision-making, problem-solving, and overall productivity within the team. E. Speak to: This option, like option B, is related to communication but does not necessarily translate to effective communication. Team members can speak to each other without truly understanding or anticipating each other's thoughts. In conclusion, the best answer is D. Think, as it represents the ability of team members to anticipate and understand each other's thought processes - a key aspect of effective communication within a team."},{"question":"The 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup was the twentieth edition of the U-20 World Cup since its inception in 1977 as the FIFA World Youth Championship.

After the waste is removed from the blood by nephrons, it gets combined with water and other substances to create urine. The urine is then collected in the renal pelvis and travels down through the ureters to the urinary bladder, where it is stored until it is finally expelled from the body through the urethra during urination."},{"question":"Please add spaces between words: Itisastoragetechnologywhichisusedtocombinemultipledisksintoasinglelogicalunit.","response":"It is a storage technology which is used to combine multiple disks into a single logical unit. In the modern era of technology, organizations and individuals deal with an enormous amount of data. Efficient data storage and management are critical for smooth operations and data recovery in case of failures. One solution to manage this task is by using a storage technology that combines multiple disks into a single logical unit. This technology is called RAID, which stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID is a powerful data storage technology that combines the storage capacity and processing power of multiple physical hard drives into a single unit. By distributing the data across these drives, RAID offers various benefits, including improved reliability, performance, and redundancy. There are several RAID levels, each designed to provide different degrees of data protection, capacity, and performance. Some common RAID levels are RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 6. Each RAID level uses a different method for combining and distributing data among multiple hard drives: 1. RAID 0 (Striping): This RAID level offers improved performance by splitting data into smaller blocks and distributing these blocks across all the hard drives in the array. It does not provide any redundancy or fault tolerance, making it less suitable for sensitive data storage, as the failure of one disk can result in complete data loss. 2. RAID 1 (Mirroring): RAID 1 provides data redundancy by duplicating data across two or more disks. In this configuration, the same data is stored on each disk, offering complete redundancy. If one disk fails, the other disk(s) can still provide access to the data without any data loss. RAID 1 is commonly used for providing fault tolerance but is less efficient in terms of storage capacity since it requires double the amount of storage. 3. RAID 5 (Distributed Parity): In RAID 5, data blocks are distributed among multiple disks, with each disk holding a portion of the data and an associated parity block. Parity blocks are used to reconstruct the missing data if a disk fails. RAID 5 requires a minimum of three disks and provides a balance between storage efficiency, performance, and fault tolerance. It can continue to function with the loss of one disk, but if a second disk fails before the first one is replaced, data will be lost. 4. RAID 6 (Dual Distributed Parity): RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but uses two parity blocks per disk instead of one, providing even higher redundancy and fault tolerance. It can handle the failure of two disks simultaneously without data loss. RAID 6 requires a minimum of four disks and is especially suited for large storage systems where reliability and data protection are critical. In conclusion, combining multiple disks into a single logical unit using RAID technology is an efficient means of managing and safeguarding data, especially in large-scale operations. By selecting an appropriate RAID level, organizations and individuals can achieve the desired balance between storage capacity, data protection, and performance to suit their specific needs."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, cares nothing about the dowry, but to Mary Kate the dowry represents her independence, identity, and pride. She feels passionately and intensely that the dowry is hers and is needed to validate her marriage to Sean.

The Natives are led by William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), an American Protestant nativist, with an open hatred of recent immigrants. The leader of the immigrant Irish, the \\"Dead Rabbits\\", is Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), who has a young son, Amsterdam (played as a child by Cian McCormack). Cutting and Vallon meet with their respective gangs in a horrific and bloody battle, concluding when Bill kills Priest Vallon, which Amsterdam witnesses. Cutting declares the Dead Rabbits outlawed and orders Vallon's body be buried with honor. Amsterdam seizes the knife that kills his father, races off and buries it. He is found and taken to the orphanage at Hellgate. Sixteen years later, Amsterdam returns to New York as a grown man (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the second year of the Civil War. It is September 1862, days after the Battle of Antietam and the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. Arriving in Five Points, he reunites with an old friend, Johnny Sirocco (Henry Thomas).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a city nearby happens, how will it affect \\"the rain doesnt turn into aluminum\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"If there is a city nearby, it is possible that the increased pollution from human activities, such as industrial production and vehicle emissions, will contribute to the formation of acid rain. This may, in turn, exacerbate the process of aluminum leaching from clay particles in the soil. In this scenario, the perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. With higher levels of pollutants originating from the city, acid rain may become more frequent and intense. This increased acidity could lead to greater aluminum release from clay particles, further affecting the pH of the soil and water and potentially damaging plants and animals in the local ecosystem. To summarize, the presence of a nearby city may indirectly impact the process of acid rain leaching aluminum from clay particles in the soil, as well as the related ecological consequences, by increasing the concentration of pollutants that contribute to the formation of acid rain."},{"question":"Complete the passage.

'Keane's insistence on maintaining high standards and his refusal to accept anything less was instrumental in the success of Manchester United during that period.' Ferdinand described how, during his first training session, he was playing a practice match and received the ball from a teammate. Rather than making a forward pass or trying to drive the ball through the opposing team's midfield, he chose to play it safe and passed it sideways to a fellow defender. 'Before I knew it, Roy was in my face, screaming at me about how this wasn't how things were done here,' Ferdinand recalled. 'He told me that a Manchester United player never takes the easy option, and that I had to be brave and positive on the pitch.' Keane's confrontation sent a clear message to the new signing. With his guidance, Ferdinand quickly understood and adapted to the winning mentality that had made Manchester United one of the most successful clubs in Europe. The central defender soon began to take more risks on the ball and build up play from the back, using his passing and ball control to create goal-scoring opportunities for the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Paul Scholes, and Ryan Giggs. During the three seasons Ferdinand and Keane played together at Manchester United, the club enjoyed great success both domestically and internationally. They won the Premier League twice, in 2002-2003 and 2006-2007, the FA Cup in 2003-2004, and reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2001-2002 and the quarter-finals in 2002-2003. Reflecting on the impact Keane had on his own career, Ferdinand said: 'Every time I stepped onto the pitch, whether it was a training session or a match, Roy's words rang in my ear. I always asked myself, \\"Am I being positive? Am I taking risks? Am I giving everything?\\"' Ferdinand concluded by expressing gratitude for Keane's tough love approach and acknowledged that it was an essential part of his development as a player. 'Playing with Roy made me a better footballer and a winner,' he said. 'His passion, determination, and leadership inspired everyone around him, and I feel fortunate to have had the chance to play alongside and learn from such a great player.' In those years, Roy Keane not only shaped an already talented player in Rio Ferdinand but also managed to inspire other team members to constantly raise the bar and maintain the level of excellence that has come to be synonymous with Manchester United. Now retired, both players are remembered as key figures in the club's history and continue to pass on their knowledge and experience to the next generation of footballers."},{"question":"Does the following sentence make sense? \\"The United States can thank the French Navy for helping them to win the Revolutionary War.\\" Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"1.

The food was mostly disappointing, with the exception of the feta fries, which the author really enjoyed. They noted that the wait time for the food was long, and their friend's dish was not satisfactory. The author's overall impression of the restaurant's service and food quality was negative, and they would only consider returning for the feta fries."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Which documentary, Point of Order! or In the Basement is about the Senate Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954? Answer:","response":"Point of Order! is the documentary that focuses on the Senate Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954. Directed by Emile de Antonio, this documentary provides a detailed examination of the historical event that took place during the early years of the Cold War. The Army-McCarthy hearings were significant because they marked the climax of Senator Joseph McCarthy's controversial anti-communist campaign, where he accused numerous individuals and institutions within the United States of being infiltrated by communists. By utilizing actual footage from the televised hearings, the documentary Point of Order! provides an insightful perspective on the tense political climate of the time, showcasing the dramatic confrontations between McCarthy, his chief counsel Roy Cohn, and the U.S. Army's lead counsel, Joseph Welch. This documentary gives viewers a clear understanding of the tactics and strategies employed by McCarthy in his efforts to expose supposed communist threats. In contrast, In the Basement is a dark and intriguing 2014 documentary by renowned Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl. This film explores the intimate and peculiar world of what people do in their basements, such as engaging in hobbies, building collections, or creating spaces for their own personal entertainment or pleasure. The underlying theme of this documentary is the exploration of human behavior and desires, with a focus on the private, secretive, and sometimes disturbing aspects of our lives hidden behind closed doors. In conclusion, it is the documentary Point of Order! that revolves around the Senate Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954, capturing the intense political environment and the ultimate downfall of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusade. Conversely, In the Basement delves into the hidden world of personal obsessions and human behavior unrelated to the McCarthy hearings."},{"question":"Sentence: Alan Shepard got the Distinguished Service Medal of United States Navy, which has a higher rank than the Department of Commerce Gold Medal.

What do you think SME should expect from cloud service providers in near future? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"Question 1: What all government jobs can I get that do not require minimum %? There are several government jobs that do not have a minimum percentage requirement. These positions focus more on the skills and knowledge of the applicant, rather than their academic performance in terms of percentages. Here are some examples of such government jobs: 1. Lower Division Clerk (LDC)/Upper Division Clerk (UDC) - These positions usually involve administrative tasks, such as data entry and document management. The main requirement for these jobs can range from qualifying in entrance exams conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) or any other state-level recruitment board. 2. Multitasking Staff (MTS) - The primary role of MTS personnel is to provide support services in various government departments. The selection is done on the basis of a competitive examination conducted by the Staff Selection Commission or state-level recruitment boards. 3. Constable - A constable is an entry-level police officer. To become one, you need to qualify for the Police Constable Recruitment Exam, which is organized by several state police departments. There is no minimum percentage required, although there may be a requirement for minimum educational qualifications such as 10th or 12th standard pass. 4. Railway jobs - Indian Railways is one of the largest employers in India, and they offer jobs for various positions ranging from technical to non-technical roles. Some positions, like Trackman, Helper, or Porter, might not require a minimum percentage, but will need the candidate to pass a written and physical examination. 5. Drivers - Government departments require drivers to operate their official vehicles. With a valid driving license and some experience, you can apply for driver positions in various departments. There is no minimum percentage requirement for such positions. It is essential to note that, although these jobs do not have a minimum percentage requirement, they may still require the applicants to possess specific educational qualifications and skills, and to pass different recruitment-based examinations. Question 2: What do you think SMEs should expect from cloud service providers in the near future? Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly started to adopt cloud services to simplify and streamline their business operations. In the near future, SMEs can expect the following from cloud service providers: 1. Enhanced Security: With growing cyber threats and data breaches, cloud service providers need to continuously improve their security measures. SMEs can expect advanced and strong security protocols, ensuring the safety of their sensitive data. 2. Scalability and Flexibility: Cloud providers should offer agile and easily scalable solutions to accommodate the growing needs of SMEs. Services should be designed to allow companies to scale up or down as needed without incurring excessive costs. 3. Cost-effective Solutions: As SMEs usually have limited budgets, cloud service providers should offer cost-effective and customized solutions that cater to the specific needs of small and medium businesses. 4. Simplified Integration: SMEs can expect better integration and interoperability between different cloud services, applications, and platforms, streamlining their processes and making it easier to manage complex business requirements. 5. Consulting and Managed Services: To help SMEs make better decisions and optimize their IT infrastructure, cloud providers should offer consulting and managed services that offer expert guidance in leveraging cloud technologies for their specific business needs. 6. Improved Data Privacy and Compliance: Cloud providers should ensure that their services adhere to strict data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, and support SMEs in staying compliant with their industry standards and legal requirements. 7. Enhanced Customer Support: Timely and efficient customer support is crucial for SMEs using cloud services. They can expect improved and more responsive support options, including 24/7 availability, quicker response times, and expert assistance for resolving issues. To conclude, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about government jobs that do not require a minimum percentage, while the second question is about the expectations of SMEs from cloud service providers in the near future. They are distinct questions that focus on different topics."},{"question":"În orice caz, trebuie să se promoveze şi să se apere libertatea presei, precum şi egalitatea de şanse dintre femei şi bărbaţi şi, mai general, drepturile fundamentale ale omului.

The collision happened in Bridgehouses at Kelham Island and is causing traffic to be backed up along Penistone Road. Transport operator Stagecoach Yorkshire said at 1.30pm there are delays to services which are being diverted along Hoyle Street, Meadow Street and Scotland Street between Shalesmoor and West Bar. Can we infer the following? Traffic will be backed up for 8 hours","response":"To infer if traffic will be backed up for 8 hours, we need to examine the information given and analyze the factors that may affect the duration of the traffic backup. Step 1: Identify relevant information - Road traffic collision occurred near Sheffield city centre - Collision happened in Bridgehouses at Kelham Island - Traffic is backed up along Penistone Road - Delays reported at 1.30 pm - Services are being diverted along Hoyle Street, Meadow Street, and Scotland Street Step 2: Analyze factors that may affect the duration of the traffic backup - Severity of the collision: The more severe the collision, the longer it may take to clear the scene. - Number of vehicles involved: More vehicles involved increases the time it takes to address the situation. - Emergency services' response: The quicker the emergency services respond and resolve the incident, the shorter the traffic backup may last. - Effectiveness of the detour: If the detour routes successfully redirect traffic, the backup may be resolved more quickly. Step 3: Determine if we can infer the 8-hour duration Based on the information given, we can't directly infer that the traffic will be backed up for 8 hours. We don't have enough details about the severity of the collision, the number of vehicles involved, the response time of emergency services, or the efficiency of the detour.

Step 1: Consider the options given In this situation, there are four options presented for what the subject might do with the video tapes. Each option is analyzed below: - \\"He might get them put on his video camera\\": Not a viable option, as the tapes were already taken using the video camera. - \\"He might get them converted to a VHS format\\": VHS is an older, less convenient format, which would not provide any significant benefit in this case. - \\"None of the above choices\\": This option is only considered if none of the other choices seem appropriate. - \\"He might get them converted to a digital format\\": This is likely the most practical option, as it allows for easier sharing, storage, and preservation of the video footage. Step 2: Compare the options Based on the analysis above, converting the video tapes to a digital format stands out as the most practical choice, as it provides multiple benefits including ease of sharing, storage, and preservation. Step 3: Choose the best option In conclusion, the subject might choose to get the video tapes converted to a digital format.

Since The Washington Post published a story online Thursday afternoon in which four women accused Moore of making romantic or sexual advances on them when they were teenagers, four polls — all conducted using less expensive methodologies — have showed the candidates roughly neck-and-neck. The most recently released survey, an automated poll from the Republican-leaning firm JMC Analytics and Polling, shows the Democrat leading by 4 percentage points. Story Continued Below Jones leads Moore in the JMC Analytics poll, 48 percent to 44 percent, with 8 percent undecided or favoring another candidate in Alabama's Dec. 12 special Senate election. The poll was conducted last Thursday through Saturday. The previous JMC Analytics survey, conducted in late September and early October, showed Moore ahead by 8 points. JMC conducts landline-only polls administered by an automated interviewer. Moore has a 4-point lead in a Change Research poll, conducted online Thursday through Saturday, 44 percent to 40 percent — with a larger share of undecided voters, 16 percent. The two other surveys were each conducted in a single day — a practice that increases the prospect of error, according to polling experts, because it tends to include the easiest voters to reach. A Gravis Marketing survey, conducted Friday for the blog Big League Politics via automated calls to landlines and online interviews with cellphone-only voters, had Moore at 48 percent and Jones at 46 percent, with 6 percent undecided.

You can unsubscribe at any time. The other one-day poll was conducted Thursday night — immediately after the Post story about Moore. That survey, conducted by Opinion Savvy for Decision Desk HQ and interviewing voters via automated calls to landlines and mobile respondents via ads or push notifications from their applications, found the two candidates knotted at 46 percent. Each of the new polls has potential shortcomings. Nearly half of Alabama adults, 46 percent, lived in a household without a landline, according to 2015 data; the percentage is almost certainly larger today. One of the four polls didn’t interview respondents without a landline at all, while two of the others blended landline interviews with cellphone voters reached online or via smartphone apps. The Change Research poll was conducted entirely online but required respondents to self-identify as Alabama voters likely to cast ballots in a low-turnout race. (Breitbart News, which is backing Moore and has cast doubt on the molestation allegations against him, reported that an in-state consulting firm that has worked for Moore in the past found the Republican ahead by 10 points in a Saturday-evening survey, though that poll wasn't released publicly.) Previously, polls of likely voters in the special election had showed Moore with a more consistent lead. But these new, instant polls are often misleading barometers of how sudden, negative news coverage can impact a campaign. Donald Trump cratered in the polls in the immediate wake of the “Access Hollywood” video — in which Trump joked about sexually assaulting women — roughly a month before last year’s presidential election. But Trump recovered in subsequent weeks, winning the Electoral College and finishing about 2 percentage points behind Hillary Clinton in the popular vote. The Moore story has some parallels in recent Senate races. Five years ago, after then-Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) made his infamous “legitimate rape” comment in an interview with a St. Louis TV station, four immediate polls showed results ranging from a 1-point Akin lead to a 10-point advantage for Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). Before that, Akin had led every public poll of the race conducted that year. McCaskill would build on her lead over the final weeks of the campaign, eventually trouncing Akin by 16 points. In that case, Republicans first tried to push Akin out of the race, then abandoned him en masse — including Mitt Romney, the party’s presidential nominee. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), then-chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in the weeks following Akin’s comment that the committee wouldn’t spend money to help Akin defeat McCaskill. It was later revealed in campaign finance reports filed after the election that the NRSC made a late cash transfer to the Missouri Republican Party. “We needed to do what we needed to do to help win Senate seats,” Cornyn told POLITICO in December 2012. Also in 2012, Republican Richard Mourdock similarly found himself in hot water over comments about rape and pregnancy in an Indiana Senate race. Indiana prohibits automated-phone polling, so there was little public data available to track how large a factor Mourdock’s statement was in his eventual loss to then-Rep. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.). Mourdock’s publicly released internal polls showed him and Donnelly neck-and-neck, while a Donnelly internal poll showed the Democrat leading by a larger margin. Donnelly won by 6 points on Election Day. Most rigorous campaign polling is done over three days to ensure pollsters aren’t capturing only the most easily reached voters, so both parties will likely be poring over new polling data over the next few days. Don’t expect to see this polling in the public domain: Democrats are wary of nationalizing the race in a state Trump carried by nearly 30 points last fall, and Republicans are unlikely to make a public display of support for a candidate accused of sexually abusing a minor — or to release data that show the GOP nominee struggling. But the decisions made by both parties over the coming week will likely be informed by what that data suggest about how Alabama voters are reacting to the scandal. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

They seem to do a big business from the hospitals at lunch and their food comes out ultra quickly which is good if you're on the go. They seem to do a good job with training their employees. I just wasn't crazy about the breading/seasoning on the chicken- it tasted a little bland/sour and when you say crispy, I guess I expected more crispy batter ala KFC on the outside and the batter was quite thin. The accompanying sauces named after various South Carolina places were boring (buffalo, jerk, bourbon, honey mustard, etc.) The best was the Old Edisto sweet honey BBQ sauce. The salad was bland without the dressing but the dressing itself didn't complement the salad at all. The saving grace of the meal was the delicious cornbread which was sweet and moist, and the frozen banana pudding pop in a dixie cup with caramel and chocolate, which incidentally is not a good thing to eat while driving. Consider yourself warned. It is, of course, absolutely delicious but despite being small (in a Dixie cup) it is quite dense and filling and I couldn't finish one.

Two days after the events of the first film, a traumatized and blood-covered Sarah escapes the cave with no memory of the events. She is taken to a hospital, where it is found that some of the blood on her belongs to Juno Kaplan. Sheriff Vaines takes his deputy Elen Rios, Sarah, and three spelunking specialists – Dan, Greg, and Cath – to the cave to find the missing women. The team members are sent down via an old mine shaft operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald. The group discovers Rebecca's mutilated body, causing Sarah to have flashbacks of the crawlers and causing Vaines to believe Sarah may be responsible for the girls' disappearance. While crawling through a tunnel, she attacks Vaines and the others, causing the others to split up. Vaines runs to search for Sarah, and in the process is surprised by a crawler, and fires his gun in a panic, causing a minor collapse in the cavern which traps Cath, separating her from Rios, Dan, and Greg. The three decide to find an alternate way around in order to try to free Cath and arrive in a room full of bones, where they find Holly's video camera. They watch it and realize the women were attacked by the crawlers. The three are then themselves attacked by crawlers and separated. Rios starts calling for help, alerting the crawlers to her location, but is rescued by Sarah. The two then watch as a crawler kills Dan and drags his body away, prompting Sarah to inform Rios that the crawlers are blind and hunt via sound. After escaping from and killing a crawler, Cath finds Greg before the two escape from another crawler and find Sam's body. They decide to try to use her to swing across a chasm, but are attacked again. Greg sacrifices himself to buy time for Cath, but she ultimately does not survive.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Usage: k = 2, i = 5, A = ['U', '829', '4653', 'E', 'M', '1427', 'l', 'P', 'k', '7197', '7665']. In this example, k and i are integers (2 and 5), and A is a list of mixed elements. Part #2: Find every ith element starting from the kth element. Usage: Starting from the 2nd element in A, which is '829', find every 5th element.

Little did the eager spectators know that the next excruciating 120 minutes would unfold into a testament to just how deep into the abyss of mediocrity a film can plummet. \\"Twilight Falls\\" is a bizarre hybrid of gothic romance, teen angst, and an exercise in unsuccessful boundary-pushing, served up on a silver platter of dazzling special effects. Sadly, the film's high production value does little to save it from collapsing under the weight of its numerous shortcomings. Let's start with the plot, or, rather, the lack thereof. The story follows the desperate attempts of a brooding vampire (Alexander Grayson) seeking redemption whilst being torn between his insatiable bloodlust and an inexplicable instant love for the high school ingénue, Lily Barnes. As the film progresses, the romance fails to stir any genuine emotion, and the intensity of their love remains as shallow as the characters themselves. It is apparent that the scriptwriting team opted for an allegorical reappropriation of the classic Shakespearean tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. Unfortunately, the lack of insight behind the characters' motivations and the cliché-ridden dialogue amount to a missed opportunity for a nuanced interpretation of this time-honored tale. The writer has inexplicably sewn together fragments of familiar cinematic tropes in a chaotic tapestry, resulting in a scattered narrative that neither builds suspense nor manages to intrigue. While the cinematography is undeniably impressive, it stands as a lone ember in the cold, dark ashes of this catastrophic celluloid creation. The overused slow-motion shots and swooping camera movements serve to undermine the storyline rather than enhance it, leaving viewers wondering if the director sought to compensate for the drably written screenplay. This visual extravaganza is a reminder that the creative team behind \\"Twilight Falls\\" had the resources to deliver a true masterpiece, making its failure all the more poignant. Next to bear the brunt of criticism are the performances. The ensemble cast struggles to breathe life into wooden, one-dimensional characters, under the yoke of an inept director's vision. Alexander Grayson is contrived and unconvincing as the heartthrob vampire, his sultry smolders acting as a poor substitute for genuine emotion. As for his female counterpart, Lily Barnes delivers a confused portrayal of a girl in love. Her inability to capture the passion needed for this role ultimately unravels the film's love story at its foundational level. Perhaps the greatest offense in \\"Twilight Falls'\\" litany of errors is its dull predictability. Throughout the movie, viewers are treated to an array of predictable plot twists and turns, executed without a modicum of subtlety. This utter lack of surprise serves to erode what little anticipatory excitement remains among audience members, leaving them to endure the film's incessant meanderings. In summary, \\"Twilight Falls\\" is an aspiring epic that tragically misses the mark. It stumbles in the darkness of its own ambition, dragging viewers along the cold, rocky path of clichés, overused motifs, and squandered potential. It is a dire reminder of what can happen when a film forsakes engaging storytelling for superficial dazzle - a warning to be heeded by future filmmakers who aspire to breathe new life into the burgeoning realm of vampire romantic cinema."},{"question":"How is \\"With impossibly high shrieks, they dived straight at the party on shore.\\" said in Czech?","response":"In Czech, the phrase \\"With impossibly high shrieks, they dived straight at the party on shore.\\" can be translated as: \\"S nemožně vysokými výkřiky se vrhli přímo na večírek na břehu.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"With impossibly high shrieks\\" = \\"S nemožně vysokými výkřiky\\" - \\"S\\" in Czech is a preposition that can mean \\"with\\" - \\"nemožně\\" is an adverb that translates to \\"impossibly\\" - \\"vysokými\\" is an adjective in the instrumental plural form, meaning \\"high\\" - \\"výkřiky\\" is a noun in the instrumental plural form, meaning \\"shrieks\\" - \\"they dived straight\\" = \\"se vrhli přímo\\" - \\"se\\" in this context is a reflexive pronoun - \\"vrhli\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"vrhnout\\", which means \\"to dive\\" or \\"to throw oneself\\" - \\"přímo\\" is an adverb that translates to \\"straight\\" - \\"at the party\\" = \\"na večírek\\" - \\"na\\" is a preposition that can mean \\"at\\" or \\"on\\" - \\"večírek\\" is a noun, meaning \\"party\\" - \\"on shore\\" = \\"na břehu\\" - \\"na\\" is a preposition that can mean \\"at\\" or \\"on\\" - \\"břehu\\" is a noun in the locative singular form, meaning \\"shore\\" or \\"bank\\" So, the complete translation in Czech is: \\"S nemožně vysokými výkřiky se vrhli přímo na večírek na břehu.\\" This translation captures the meaning and tone of the original English phrase while adhering to Czech grammar and structure."},{"question":"Add punctuation: Mr Gorbatchev President of the Soviet Union resigns","response":"Mr. Gorbatchev, President of the Soviet Union, resigns."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: When was the brewery founded by the family who resided in the Lemp Mansion founded?

David Robertson (right) was sent off in his first game playing for Rangers against Celtic Rangers boss Kenny McDowall poses with the Scottish League Cup ahead of the Old Firm clash with Celtic.' As the players prepare for this high-stakes game, they should keep their focus on demonstrating their skills and commitment to their respective teams rather than getting caught up in the emotions and intensity surrounding the derby. By taking a leaf from David Robertson's playbook, these derby debutants can aim to perform at their best and leave a lasting impression on their fans and the wider football community. It's worth noting that even experienced players like David Robertson can make mistakes, as was the case when he was sent off in his first game playing for Rangers against Celtic. However, these challenges often serve as valuable learning experiences, allowing players to refine their approach and bolster their resilience for future games. As such, derby newcomers should strive to maintain their composure throughout the match, recognizing that setbacks can pave the way for growth, both on and off the pitch. In the lead-up to Sunday's eagerly anticipated Old Firm clash, Rangers boss Kenny McDowall will no doubt prepare his squad for the contest by emphasizing the importance of staying focused on the game itself rather than succumbing to the pressure of the occasion. With the Scottish League Cup at stake, both teams will have their sights set on achieving victory, and it is through discipline, determination, and skill that the winning team will ultimately prevail. Ultimately, the outcome of this Old Firm clash will hinge on the ability of the players, especially the derby debutants, to play the game and not the occasion. By following the example of seasoned veterans like David Robertson and keeping their emotions in check, these newcomers can make a positive impact on their respective teams, contribute to a memorable game, and potentially help secure the coveted Scottish League Cup for their side.

Events in Colombia over recent months have Â once again thrust the the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) into the spotlight. The group has spent decades battling the Colombian government, proclaiming its struggle to be a fight for the country's poor against their wealthy oppressors. However the Colombian government and other detractors say the group is responsible for a string of rights abuses, including bomb attacks, kidnappings, assassinations and extortion of local businesses. Human rights organisations have condemned the Farc's used of child fighters and its indiscriminate targeting of civilians. They are also accused of hypocrisy for funding much of their activities through the trafficking of cocaine, with around 65 of the group's 110 operational units involved in the trade, according to a 2005 International Crisis Group report. The group's roots lie in what is known in Colombia as \\"La Violencia\\", a bloody period in the 1940s and 1950s sparked when Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, a popular left-wing politician, was assassinated, leading to a wave of violence between right-wing and left-wing armed groups. Manuel 'Sureshot' Marulanda is theleader of the Farc [GALLO/GETTY]TheÂ fighting leftÂ up toÂ 300,000 people dead and spawned several groups, including the Farc, the ELN and M-19 movements. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the country's Communist Party (although 1966 has also been mooted as the date), the group spent the 1960s and 1970s acting as a \\"guerilla\\" force carrying out operations against the military in its heartland of the south and east of Colombia. However, during the 1980s, the movement developed a formal army structure, organising into squads and fronts. The group is governed by a seven-member secretariat, led by Manuel Marulanda, nicknamed \\"Tirofijo\\" or \\"Sureshot\\" because of his reported shooting skills. The group was believed to have had about 16,000 fighters in 2001, although that figure now is down to between 6,000 and 8,000, according to the government. The Farc has been involved in on-off peace negotiations since 1984, when it set up a political party, the Patriotic Union, to achieve its ends. But the party was undermined by a series of assassinations by right-wing paramilitaries and in 1985, the group returned to its armed campaign. In 1998 the then-president of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, allocated a 42,000 square kilometre safe haven for the Farc, which had previously been a pre-condition of the group for peace talks. However by 2002 negotiations stalled after attacks continued and Pastrana ordered the army to retake the territory. Protesters have demanded IngridÂ Betancourt's release [AFP]In an attempt to force the government to accede to itsÂ demands and to release captured fighters, the Farc has taken hundreds of hostages. These include Ingrid Betancourt, a former presidential candidate, and three US military contractors. The hostages are held in poor conditions, sometimes in cages deep in jungle areas controlled by the Farc. One hostage released by the Farc said he and others had suffered \\"subhuman conditions\\" during their captivity. The group has recently released some captives on what it has said are ethical grounds in a deal brokered byÂ Hugo Chavez, theÂ Venezuelan president,Â but it rejected a government deal over Betancourt, saying its fighters must be released from Colombian jails first. In 2002 Alvaro Uribe was elected president of Colombia. A more \\"hardline\\" politician than his predecessor, his own father, a wealthy landowner, was assassinated by the Farc during a failed kidnapping attempt. Uribe has intensified the Colombian military assault on the Farc andÂ the Colombian army'sÂ better-equipped forces, trained and advised by the US, have scored a number of significant victories. A number of senior commanders have been killed, including Raul Reyes, who died in a controversial a cross-border raid on Farc camp in Ecuador by the Colombian military, which sparked a still lingering diplomatic crisis in the region. The group has also suffered a number of desertions as fighters became disillusioned with the group's involvement in the drug trade. But while the group has suffered a number of setbacks, it is far from defeated. Chavez has offered Farc vocal support and earlier this year called forÂ the groupÂ and the smaller ELN organisation to be removed from government lists of terror groups. And the Colombian government may now be more wary of carrying out cross-border military operations against the Farc, after Latin American governments reacted angrily to its raid into Ecuador.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What was the nickname of Casey's twin brother? Title: The Unborn Movie plot: Casey Beldon has nightmarish hallucinations of strange-looking dogs in the neighbourhood and an evil child with bright blue eyes following her around. While babysitting Matty, her neighbor's son, she finds him showing his infant sibling its reflection in a mirror. Matty attacks Casey, smashing the mirror on her head, and tells her: \\"Jumby wants to be born now\\". She puts him to bed and leaves in shock. Casey's friend Romy tells her of a superstition that newborns should not see their reflections in the mirror for at least a year because otherwise they will die soon. Casey's eyes begin to change color; a doctor asks if she is a twin, and explains the change as tetragametic chimerism and heterochromia, and that is completely normal. Her neighbor's infant dies, supporting the superstition. Casey's father admits that she had a twin brother years ago who died while he was in the womb when her umbilical cord strangled him, and whom he and Casey's mother had nicknamed \\"Jumby\\". She begins to suspect that the spirit is haunting her and that is the soul of her dead twin wanting to be born so it can enter the world of the living as evil. Casey meets Sofi Kozmaâwhom she later learns is her grandmotherâwho explains that as a child she had a twin brother who died during Nazi experiments in Auschwitz during World War II. A dybbuk brought the brother back to life to use as a portal into the world of the living. Kozma killed her twin to stop the spirit, and now it haunts her family for revenge, which is why Casey's mother became insane and committed suicide. Kozma gives Casey a hamsa amulet for protection; instructs her to destroy all mirrors and burn the shards; and refers her to Rabbi Joseph Sendak, who can perform a Jewish exorcism to remove the dybbuk out of her soul. Sendak does not believe Casey's story until he sees a dog with its head twisted upside down in his synagogue. The dybbuk kills Kozma and, soon after, Romy. Casey and her boyfriend Markâwho both see the spirit after it kills Romyârealize that it is... Answer:","response":"Jumby"},{"question":"Foldthebottompartofhisown.

The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. and the situation: Two friends had a discussion about the Earth and what this reality might be. Tim believed in the Gaia hypothesis, while Olly believed in the Panspermia theory. Answer the following question: Which friend believed that the Earth tends to achieve a stable state? A:","response":"Tim is the friend who believed that the Earth tends to achieve a stable state. His belief is rooted in the Gaia hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that the Earth, or more specifically the biosphere, is its own living organism. It suggests that Earth is self-regulating and continuously strives to achieve a state of balance and stability, a concept also known as homeostasis. This balance is not only about the physical aspects of the Earth like geology and climate, but also the biological life that inhabits it. According to the Gaia hypothesis, life on Earth interacts with the physical environment on a level that maintains this equilibrium. One such example would be the regulation of carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere. If the levels increase, plants step in to remedy the situation by growing faster and thus absorbing more carbon dioxide, helping maintain that balance. This idea of Earth as a holistic, self-maintaining organism focuses largely on how the interdependence of both living organisms and their physical environment work concurrently to preserve a favorable state for life to flourish. Ultimately, the Gaia hypothesis perceives the Earth as an integrated whole, rather than a random collection of isolated parts. So, it is Tim who advocates this view, identifying the Earth as an entity that is capable of self-regulation and a drive towards sustainment of a stable state. On the other hand, Olly, who believes in the Panspermia theory, would hold a different perspective about life's origin and sustaining forces on Earth."},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Polish.

The data is organized by various factors such as the year, industry (using the DB07 classification system), sector, type of work, socioeconomic status, and the sex of the workers. It is important to note that this particular dataset has been discontinued, implying that it is no longer being updated or maintained. The National Accounts Industrial Classification system is a framework used to categorize economic activities based on their similarity and structure. This system enables better organization and comparison of data across industries, sectors, and countries for analytical purposes. The DB07 classification system is a specific industry classification system used in identifying various industries according to their economic activities. This system is tailored for the analysis of complex industrial data in various sectors and countries. It allows for the clear differentiation of industries based on the nature of their economic activities. The data on the Working Time Account on National Accounts Industrial Classification is divided across multiple factors, such as the sector, which refers to different areas of economic activity such as agriculture, manufacturing, or services. These sectors contain various industries with related economic activities falling under a specific category. The type of work is another factor that influences the dataset, reflecting the various ways work may be performed. This can include full-time, part-time, temporary, or permanent work, as well as whether the work is paid or unpaid. The socioeconomic status is an essential aspect to understanding the context of the working time accounts. It encompasses indicators such as income, education, and occupation, which helps provide a more comprehensive view of the workforce and the different types of employees that contribute to the economy. Lastly, the dataset is differentiated by sex, allowing for the analysis of working time accounts through a gender perspective. This is crucial for understanding the structure and distribution of work across both male and female workers and how it may impact various aspects of the economy, like wage gaps and career progression. Overall, the Atr32 dataset on Working Time Account on National Accounts Industrial Classification gives a detailed breakdown of the working time accounts in various sectors and industries, providing valuable insights into the labor market and the economy as a whole.

ZooBank Life Science Identifier (LSID) for the oogenus: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:C5B99229-C8C5-4322-B7B7-9E827DBF8F3B As combined characters: ellipsoid eggs, size approximately 42 x 26 mm; ornamented outer surface with very small bumps; average shell thickness of 160 μm; trapezoidal shell units tightly packed together and wider than taller, with almost no interstices at the bases of the shell units. The shell thickness is 160 μm (n = 80, sd = 17 μm). Microscopically, in radial section, the wedges of the shell units are clearly visible, interlocked and closely packed together with little space between them, with a wider top and gradually narrowing until the darker basal knobs ( Fig 5C ). A very thin, discontinuous diagenetic layer covers the outer surface. No growth lines are visible. The basal plate groups are present ( Fig 5C ), although not observable through the whole radial section. There is a very thin, darker line at two thirds of the eggshell thickness. The shell units are sometimes domed in the upper part, resulting in the bumpy outer surface ornamentation, and a blocky extinction pattern is present when observed under cross-polarized light ( Fig 5C ). In Fig 5D , with transmitted light, on a tangential section, darker areas, corresponding to the basal plate groups, are clearly visible and show a distribution identical to what is observed in extant crocodyloid eggs [ 9 ]. The eggs are ellipsoid in shape, with blunt ends, measuring approximately 42 mm long and 26 mm wide, with an elongation index (EI) of 1.62. The external surface is lightly sculptured by slightly uneven, tiny bumps ( Fig 5A ). No evidence of extrinsic degradation can be appreciated. The internal surface shows a tight packing of the basal knobs ( Fig 5B ). No pore openings have been observed. Macroscopically, the holotype FCT-UNL706 is a clutch with 13 eggs ( Fig 4 ), seven of which are well preserved and mostly intact. The remaining are incomplete, composed of aggregates of eggshell fragments in situ. Some of the eggs are truncated, either by erosion or excavation of the clutch or by hatching, although the undisturbed aspect of the clutch allows us to consider the first scenario as the most likely. It was found in a fallen block of fine sandstone, and no sedimentological features of the block allow polarity orientation, other than the truncation of eggs, where the truncation of upper halves of the egg is more probable. Considering this orientation, most of the eggs are shown in the bottom part of the specimen, with three of the eggs only visible on the upper of the clutch. Except for two eggs, which are oriented vertically, all the others are oriented horizontally. The eggs are dark brown, standing out from the very fine, light gray sandstone matrix, and show a fractured and cracked surface. Nonetheless, the clutch is well preserved and, even though there is truncation in some of the eggs which is a form of fossil diagenetic alteration, the eggs do not show any signs of any other severe post-burial disarrangement. Furthermore, there is no evidence of recrystallization or replacement of the original composition of the eggs. Diagnosis sensu [ 46 ] and amended to include the thinner eggshells described in this study (as combined characters): eggshell with outer surface smooth to undulating; straight pore canals ending between shell units in deep interstices; ellipsoidal eggs with two blunt ends; egg size 68–50 mm and 44–30 mm, shell thickness 170–760 μm. Description. ML760. Macroscopically, ML760 is a crushed egg (Fig 6) found in association with a theropod nest [58]. The egg is encased in a small block of reddish mudstone with some caliche nodules. Even though crushed, the egg retains a characteristic ellipsoid shape with blunt ends. It measures 70 mm in length and 40 mm in width, with an EI of 1.75. The external surface is smooth and the dark gray shell is very fractured. No pores were identified in a macroscopic observation. Eggshell thickness is 248 μm (n = 80, sd = 14 μm). Microscopically, in radial section, (Fig 7B), the basal knobs and nucleation centers are evident, but the trapezoidal shell units are faint and in most cases, hard to define due to a strong sub-horizontal fracturing that prevents a clear observation of the tabular growth structure which is barely visible (Fig 7B). The basal plate groups make up approximately 20% of the eggshell thickness. A diagenetic layer, with a thickness of 71 μm, of diagenetic secondary deposits of calcite and recrystallization, covers the external surface. The eggshell has an extremely low porosity (less than one pore per cm2). In cross-polarized light (Fig 7B2), the irregular triangular extinction pattern is clearly visible. ML195. ML195 are small, dark gray, eggshell fragments, less than 25 mm2 each, also found in association with a theropod nest. The outer and inner surfaces are smooth, with no discernible internal bumps of the basal knobs or pore openings on direct observation. The eggshell thickness is 250 μm (n = 80, sd = 8 μm), with a 14 μm diagenetic layer overlaying the outer surface. Under the microscope, the radial section (Fig 7A) shows the darker basal knobs align along the inner surface of the eggshell, about 30 μm thick (approximately 14% of the total shell thickness). The trapezoidal shell units are very faint and barely distinguishable, but still present. The horizontal lamination or tabular structure is unevenly distributed, with a lighter colored portion and fainter growth lines just above the basal knobs (Fig 7A) making up about 160 μm of the total shell thickness (approximately 62%). Just above it, there is a thin darker band of more compacted horizontal growth lines (Fig 7A), approximately 60 μm thick (about 24% of the shell thickness). In cross-polarized light, the blocky extinction is present (Fig 7A2), although less conspicuous than in ML760, ML1795 and ML1194. ML1194. Macroscopically, ML1194 are small fragments, also found in association with theropod eggs [64], very similar to ML195, both in dimensions and morphology. The inner and outer surfaces are smooth. In macroscopic observation, pores were not observed. Eggshell thickness is 220 μm (n = 80, sd = 7 μm). Microscopically, in radial section, the shell units (Fig 7D) are very faint and hard to distinguish. The basal knobs and nucleation centers make up approximately 16% of total shell thickness, with 35 μm, and are characterized by a darker coloration (Fig 7D). About 140 μm thick (approximately 63% of shell thickness), there is a portion of the eggshell characterized by a horizontal tabular lamination that shows an increase inits density from the bottom to the top (Fig 7D). A darker zone is visible (Fig 7D) just above the previous, with the tabular growth more evident, more tightly packed together, about 50 mm thick (approximately 21% of total shell thickness). The diagenetic layer is very thin and sparse, not observable throughout the whole section, and at most 20 μm thick. With cross-polarized light (Fig 7D2), the extinction triangles are visible. Pores are very few (less than a pore per cm2), and have a subcircular opening, with a diameter of 110 μm, and straight long canals (Fig 9). ML1795. ML 1795 includes four crushed, very fragmented eggs (Fig 8A), and eggshell fragments, found slightly south and above of ML760, and associated with a theropod nest [58]. Because the specimen is so fragile, it is still partially encased in its plaster jacket. Some of the dark brown mudstone matrix is present (Fig 8A). As with ML760, ML195, and ML1194, pores are undistinguishable macroscopically. Eggshell thickness is 250 μm (n = 80, sd = 15 μm). In microscopic observation, the shell unit wedges are clearly observable, with basal knobs and nucleation centers visible (Fig 7C), and measuring about 60 μm (approximately 25% of shell thickness). The horizontal tabular lamination is present in the middle portion of the eggshell (Fig 7C), about 100 μm thick (approximately 40% of shell thickness). A darker area, just above the latter layer, showing a more compact lamination (Fig 7C), can be differentiated (approximately 90 μm thick, about 35% of shell thickness). A diagenetic layer (Fig 7C), about 140 μm, covers the external surface of the eggshell. Pores are very scarce (less than one per mm2) and hard to observe. Still, in Fig 8C, an obstructed pore opening can be seen. The pore diameter is 42 μm. The internal openings are not visible in the samples. With cross-polarized light, the irregular triangular extinction is observable (Fig 7C2). Under the stereomicroscope and using transmitted light, the darker areas corresponding to the basal knobs and tips of the shell units are evident in the tangential section (Fig 8B). Under the SEM, the nucleation centers are noticeable (Fig 8D). ||||| The world's oldest crocodilian eggs laid 152 million years ago have been discovered in cliffs in Portugal. The eggs were laid by close relatives of \\"true\\" crocodiles, a group called crocodylomorphs. Palaeontologists say the creatures would have been two metres long. João Russo of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal, told the BBC: \\"The fact that they are from the Late Jurassic makes these eggs the oldest crocodilian eggs known so far. \\"This new discovery from Portugal extends the knowledge of this type of egg by approximately 40 million years. \\"The fossil record tells us that crocodiles and their relatives (forming the larger group of crocodylomorphs) were much more diverse in the past, with different feeding habits, ecological niche distribution or morphology.\\" The eggs have been found during excavations of the cliffs near the village of Lourinhã, north of Lisbon. They were found in several clutches and appear to be of two different types. The research is published in the journal, Plos One. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"The world's oldest crocodilian eggs, laid by crocodylomorphs about 152 million years ago, have been discovered in cliffs in Portugal.

Where is a likely place to view an old copy machine? Options: - industrial area - museum - barn - school - office Answer. museum What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Step 1: Consider the nature of each location. - Industrial area: related to manufacturing and production, not focused on displaying historical items. - Museum: an institution that conserves, preserves, and exhibits objects of historical, cultural, or scientific importance. - Barn: typically a space for storing agricultural equipment or housing animals, not focused on technology or historical items. - School: educational institution, may have some older equipment but typically not focused on exhibiting items. - Office: a workspace for conducting business or administrative tasks, may contain modern copy machines, but not historical displays. Step 2: Analyze the purpose of each location in relation to old copy machines. - Industrial area: Unlikely, since industrial areas are more related to manufacturing and production, and not to historical exhibitions. - Museum: Likely, since museums often display historical items, including technological advancements such as old copy machines. - Barn: Unlikely, since barns are typically focused on agricultural storage and housing animals, not historical exhibitions. - School: Unlikely, as a school’s primary focus is education and not the exhibition of historical objects or technology. - Office: Unlikely, since offices typically have current office equipment rather than older models or historical displays. Step 3: Compare the likelihood of each location exhibiting an old copy machine. Based on the analysis, the museum is the most likely place to view an old copy machine due to its focus on conserving, preserving, and exhibiting objects of historical importance, whereas the other locations do not have this focus or purpose."},{"question":"Write a text based on this summary: russian court finds yukos shareholder guilty of tax evasion Text:","response":"In a recent significant legal ruling, a Russian court has found a shareholder of Yukos, once Russia's largest oil company, guilty of tax evasion. This verdict further compounds the trials that Yukos has endured over the years, demonstrating the ongoing issues that stakeholders and members of the corporation face. The court's verdict arrives after an in-depth investigation into accusations of tax evasion, indicating a stringent judicial process and a monumental loss for the defendant. Exact details of the verdict however, have been kept under wraps for legal reasons. The shareholder, whose identity has not been disclosed, now faces prospects of heavy penalties that could range from considerable fines all the way to possible jail time. This judgment holds significant implications not only for the defendant and other Yukos shareholders, but also for the broader business environment and other companies in Russia. It sends a clear signal that Russian authorities are committed to clamping down on tax evasion, reinforcing the state's commitment towards maintaining a fair and transparent financial system. This is not the first time Yukos has been in legal hot water. Once seen as a landmark of Russia's capitalist evolution, the company has in recent years been embroiled in a series of controversies involving its executives and shareholders.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... Answer:","response":"The last name of the person who joined the Party and had articles published in Pravda under his name is Shostakovich. Dmitri Shostakovich, a renowned Soviet composer and pianist, experienced significant struggles with the Communist Party throughout his career. Despite his reluctance and emotional turmoil surrounding the decision, he joined the Communist Party in 1960, largely due to political pressure and the government's desire for him to hold the position of General Secretary of the Composers' Union."},{"question":"Question: how old do i have to be to get a tattoo in texas?? Answer:","response":"In the state of Texas, the minimum age requirement to get a tattoo is 18 years old. As outlined by Texas Administrative Code §229.406 & §229.411, individuals must be at least 18 years of age to legally receive a tattoo with or without parental consent. This rule is applicable to all tattoo parlors and artists operating within Texas. It is important to note that reputable tattoo artists and tattoo establishments in Texas will adhere to the age restriction laid down by the law, so you must provide a valid government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license, passport, or state-issued ID card) to verify your age before getting a tattoo. Fake IDs are not only illegal but also could lead to fines or even legal actions against both the individual and the tattoo artist or business should the fraudulent act be discovered. In addition to the age restriction, Texas tattoo artists are required to comply with sanitation, licensure, and safety requirements to ensure a safe and hygienic tattooing experience for their clients. These requirements include the use of single-use needles and ink caps, proper sterilization of equipment, appropriate disposal of waste, and maintaining a clean and sanitary work environment. Moreover, tattoo artists and establishments must have proper licenses from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) and renew their licenses annually. Furthermore, it is highly recommended that you thoroughly research and choose a reputable tattoo artist or studio before getting inked. Make sure to check their portfolio, read reviews, and inquire about their experience and knowledge regarding the proper aftercare of your tattoo. This will help you to find a skilled and trustworthy professional, ensuring that your tattoo experience is safe and satisfactory. In summary, you must be at least 18 years old to get a tattoo in Texas legally, and tattoo artists and establishments are required to follow strict regulations to ensure the safety and best experience possible for their clients."},{"question":"Sentence 1: The debate was presented by anchors Jessica Soho and Mike Enriquez of GMA News and John Nery , editor-in-chief of \`\` Inquirer.net '' .

The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has been converted into a hotspot in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large tooltip displaying a thumbnail of the Start screen. Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps.

If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What isn't the purpose of charms?","response":"The purpose of the Charms in Windows 8 is to provide quick access to system and app-related functions such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and the Start button. Therefore, the things that are not the purpose of the Charms include: 1. Serving as a file management system: The Charms do not have direct functionality in managing, organizing, or accessing files on the device. This is the responsibility of File Explorer or other file management apps. 2. Providing access to all applications: While the Charms do provide access to the Start button, they do not directly display or launch all available applications installed on the system. The Start screen or app list is primarily responsible for managing and launching apps. 3. Customizing the appearance/theme of the operating system: The Charms do not provide any customization features for the user interface, such as changing wallpapers, adjusting colors, or modifying the overall appearance of the operating system. These settings can be found elsewhere in the system settings. 4. Acting as a primary desktop interface: The Charms serve as an auxiliary component to the desktop environment rather than replacing it. They are designed to provide supplementary functionality alongside the traditional desktop interface. 5.

Which language is this?","response":"The language in the given text \\"Samoin työllisyydestä ja sairausvakuutuksista\\" is Finnish. Finnish is a Uralic language belonging to the Finnic branch and is the official language of Finland. It is also one of the two official languages of Sweden, along with Swedish. The text, when translated to English, approximately means \\"Similarly, about employment and health insurance.\\" This sentence may be a part of a larger discussion about social issues or policies in Finland. Finnish has some grammatical and phonetic qualities that make it distinct from other languages. It has fifteen cases for nouns, and it employs vowel harmony, which is a type of phonological constraint that limits which vowels can be grouped together in a word. Additionally, Finnish words often undergo a process called consonant gradation, resulting in changes to the consonant sounds within words when inflected. Finnish is not an Indo-European language, so it has a completely different structure and vocabulary compared to languages such as English, German, and French. Instead, Finnish is part of the Finno-Ugric family of languages, which also includes Hungarian and Estonian. These languages share a common ancestor, Proto-Uralic, which dates back thousands of years. Learning Finnish can be challenging for speakers of Indo-European languages due to its unique grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. However, many people find the language fascinating and rewarding."},{"question":"Consider the question. A person with an allergy might be doing what if they awake suddenly? Options: - have fun - enjoy with friends - stretch - yawn - sneezing If the answer is 'sneezing'; explain the reasoning:","response":"The answer is \\"sneezing.\\" Reasoning: An allergy is a condition in which a person's immune system responds abnormally to a foreign substance, known as an allergen. Common allergens include dust, pollen, pet dander, and certain foods. When a person with an allergy comes into contact with an allergen, their immune system reacts and releases chemicals like histamine, which can cause various symptoms such as itching, watery eyes, runny nose, and sneezing. If a person with an allergy awakes suddenly, it is possible that they were exposed to an allergen while asleep, triggering the immune response and resulting in sneezing. Sneezing is a reflex response that aims to remove irritants or foreign particles from the nasal passages.

The process begins with nominations submitted by various individuals and organizations, including government representatives, members of international courts, university professors, previous laureates, and others. The deadline for nominations is typically January 31st. The Committee then reviews the nominations and compiles a shortlist of potential candidates. Over the following months, the Committee members evaluate the nominees, aided by advisors and experts. Through a series of voting rounds, they eventually narrow down the list to one winner, or occasionally multiple joint winners. The recipient is announced in October, and the Peace Prize is awarded at a ceremony that takes place in Oslo City Hall on December 10th. This tradition has been in place since 1990.
