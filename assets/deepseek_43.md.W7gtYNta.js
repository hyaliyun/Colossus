The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Herbert A. \`\` Herb '' Magidson ( January 7 , 1906 -- January 2 , 1986 ) was an American popular lyricist . His work was used in over 23 films and four Broadway reviews . He won the first Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1934 . - Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a \\"libretto\\" and their writer, as a \\"librettist\\". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. Question: Why does the author try Naked shampoos? Options: A. Natural shampoos do not irritate his/her scalp B. not enough information C. Shampoos that have chemicals are bad D. They're aimed at damaged hair === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"A.

Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"The change in the appointment of cardinals has had a significant impact on the church in various ways. Specifically, the revision of the Code of Canon Law in 1917, which required cardinals to be ordained as priests or bishops, and later the stipulation by Pope John XXIII that a priest who is appointed a cardinal must also be consecrated a bishop, has contributed to the transformation of the role and expectations of cardinals within the Catholic Church. We can analyze the impact on the church in terms of structure, leadership, and the perception of the role of cardinals. 1. Structural impact: The shift to only appointing cardinals who are already priests or bishops has contributed to a more homogeneous group of cardinals that possess a greater level of conformity of theological training and clerical experience. This change means that cardinals now share more common ground in terms of their spiritual and pastoral responsibilities, which consequently leads to a more structured and cohesive College of Cardinals. This is particularly important given the role the College of Cardinals has in electing the Pope and advising him on church matters. 2. Impact on leadership: As a result of the new requirements, cardinals are now more experienced religious figures who can take on significant leadership roles within the church. This assures the laity and the clergy that those appointed to the highest positions within the church have the required theological background and spiritual maturity. Moreover, it leads to a more effective and knowledgeable group of leaders, better able to handle the complex and challenging issues the church faces in a rapidly changing world. 3. Impact on the role of cardinals: The end of 'lay cardinals,' who in the past were inaccurately referred to as such, signifies that all cardinals are now seen as true spiritual leaders in the church, rather than simply influential individuals with connections to the papacy. This shift has led to a greater respect for the office of the cardinal, as well as an increased sense of responsibility among those who hold the title. 4. Impact on the Church's image and credibility: By taking steps to ensure that only those who have been ordained as priests or bishops can be appointed as cardinals, the Church has addressed historical controversies surrounding the allocation of key leadership roles to individuals who might not have had the appropriate religious qualifications. This reinforces the Church's commitment to uphold the spiritual integrity of its leadership and has likely improved its credibility and trustworthiness. In conclusion, the changes in the appointment of cardinals have had a profound impact on the Catholic Church. These changes in requirements affected the structure, leadership, perception of the role, and credibility of the Church. By emphasizing the need for cardinals to have the necessary religious qualifications and experience, the Church has solidified the spiritual foundation of its highest-ranking officials and created a more cohesive and effective College of Cardinals."},{"question":"In this task you will be given a list of numbers.

Calculate the total number of smoking students from the class who have not been hospitalized from smoking-related complications. Answer. 36 What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Step 1: Determine the number of smoking students in the class. Since the number of smoking students is 40% of the total students, you can calculate this by multiplying the number of students (300) by the percentage of smokers (40%). 300 students * 40% = 300 * 0.4 = 120 smoking students. Step 2: Calculate the number of hospitalized smoking students. 70% of the smoking students are hospitalized from smoking-related complications, so you can calculate the number of hospitalized smokers by multiplying the number of smoking students (120) by the percentage of hospitalized smokers (70%). 120 smoking students * 70% = 120 * 0.7 = 84 hospitalized smoking students. Step 3: Calculate the number of smoking students not hospitalized. To find the number of smoking students who have not been hospitalized, subtract the number of hospitalized smoking students (84) from the total number of smoking students (120). 120 smoking students - 84 hospitalized smoking students = 36 smoking students.

Steve Coogan is a renowned British actor, comedian, and writer known for his quick wit and variety of characters throughout his career, both in television and film. Born on October 14, 1965, in Middleton, England, Coogan began his career in stand-up comedy and quickly made a name for himself in the British entertainment industry. He gained significant popularity for creating and portraying the character Alan Partridge, a fictional and somewhat socially awkward radio and TV presenter. The character appeared in various television and radio series and eventually made his way to the big screen. In the film adaptation of Jules Verne's classic novel 'Around The World In Eighty Days,' Coogan plays the role of Phileas Fogg, an ambitious and eccentric inventor who accepts a bet to travel around the globe within 80 days. The film, directed by Frank Coraci, is a family-friendly action-adventure-comedy that combines elements of humor, drama, and stunning visual effects. Coogan stars alongside an ensemble cast, including Jackie Chan as 'Passepartout', Fogg's loyal assistant, and Cécile de France as 'Monique La Roche', a talented French artist they meet during their journey. While the 2004 adaptation of 'Around The World In Eighty Days' did not receive the same critical acclaim or financial success as earlier film or television versions of the story, Coogan's portrayal of Phileas Fogg was widely praised for its unique blend of dry wit and charming eccentricity.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","response":"The supposed perturbation from producing more clean energy while more coal is burned would be: indirectly impacting a step of the process. To further elaborate on this, let's break down the scenario and its effects on the process of acid rain formation due to burning coal. When more clean energy is produced, it can lead to a decrease in the dependence on coal as a primary energy source. Clean energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power, do not produce sulfur emissions or other pollutants that contribute to the formation of acid rain. Over time, as the use of clean energy sources increases, there will be a gradual shift from relying on coal-based power plants to relying more on these cleaner energy sources. This change will indirectly impact the first step of the process: burning coal. As the demand for coal-based power generation decreases due to an increase in clean energy production, it will result in less coal being burned, which will ultimately lead to a decrease in sulfur emissions. This, in turn, affects the subsequent steps in the process as well, as lesser sulfur compounds will be released into the atmosphere, thus reducing the formation of sulfuric acid and eventually making the rain less acidic. However, it is important to note that this perturbation does not directly impact any individual step in the process of acid rain formation due to coal burning. Instead, the indirect impact arises from a broader shift in the energy landscape, causing a change in the emissions produced. By increasing clean energy production and reducing our dependence on coal, we can help mitigate the environmental damage caused by acid rain."},{"question":"Q: Given a sentence and an entity, the task is to select the authors sentiment towards the enity.

On the other hand, you may want your child to believe in something whimsical and magical, like Santa. How to deal with the Santa Claus story is a personal decision that can only be made by your family. Remember, though, that even if you do not share the Santa story in your own family, your child might still come to you with tricky questions about Santa. Perhaps they heard something at school or they have thought about the Santa story and it doesn't completely make sense. Acknowledge the question and praise them for their critical thinking. This is actually a positive developmental step. Determining their reason for asking will help you figure out the best way to proceed. You might give this question some thought before it ever comes up, so that you are not caught completely off guard. This will help you respond more thoughtfully and slowly, rather than be reactionary. Ask your child very plainly, \\"Why do you ask?\\" or \\"Where is this question coming from?\\". Just because the child is asking questions doesn't necessarily mean that they are emotionally ready to believe the truth. They may just be curiously probing. Asking what your child believes will give you an idea of where they are emotionally and cognitively. If your child indicates that they still believe in Santa, despite any outside doubts, it's likely not time to tell them the truth yet. Respond to your child's question with a simple, \\"Well, what do you believe?\\" This allows them to reflect on what they think and whether or not they believe in Santa Claus. When your child answers your question about what they believe, they will tell you that they don't think Santa is real, or that they do but that they have questions. This answer should guide how you proceed and you can either tell them the truth about Santa or let them continue to believe. They may also say that they do believe the story of Santa Claus, but are confused about something specific in the Santa story, such as how he gets around the world in one night, or fits all of the presents in one bag. Just reiterate whatever you've already told them and answer questions as best as you can. Summary:","response":"Dealing with the Santa Claus story is a personal decision for each family. If your child approaches you with questions about Santa, it's important to acknowledge the question and praise their critical thinking. Determine the reason for their question by asking them why they ask or where it's coming from. Then, ask your child what they believe about Santa to gauge their emotional and cognitive state. Based on their response, you can decide whether to tell them the truth or let them continue to believe. If they have specific questions about the Santa story, answer them as best as you can while reinforcing what you've already told them. Prepare yourself for this conversation in advance, so you can respond thoughtfully and deliberately."},{"question":"Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, free will either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the grandfather paradox because it is a historical fact that your grandfather was not killed before his child (your parent) was conceived. This view doesn't simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveler would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveler moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the Novikov self-consistency principle. What principle elaborates more on the view described?","response":"The Novikov Self-Consistency Principle elaborates more on the view described. This principle, formulated by Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov, asserts that any event in a time travel scenario must be self-consistent. Thus, any action taken by a time traveler in the past must have already been a part of history and cannot cause any paradoxes or change the established events in their timeline. Essentially, the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle maintains that the timeline is a fixed, unchangeable structure where all events, including the actions of time travelers, are already integrated and predetermined in a consistent way. This principle prevents the possibility of causality-based temporal paradoxes, such as the grandfather paradox, since it ensures that the past cannot be altered in a way that would contradict already established events. In this perspective, time travelers cannot create a new timeline or change the present by altering the past. Instead, their actions in the past have always been a part of the timeline and are coherently woven into the fabric of time. This principle not only preserves the consistency of historical events but also implies that the concept of free will might be limited or even non-existent for time travelers trying to change the past. By adhering to the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle, the potential problems and logical inconsistencies presented by time travel can be mitigated, leading to a more coherent and stable understanding of the effects of time travel within the context of a predetermined and self-consistent timeline."},{"question":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"The Asser Levy Public Baths are located in Manhattan, New York City, United States.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","response":"Concept 1: (Subject, Predicate, Object) (Asser Levy Public Baths, are located in, Manhattan) Justification: The main subject of the sentence is 'Asser Levy Public Baths' and the information provided about it is that they are 'located in' the region called 'Manhattan'.

David Dehoyos/NASA President Donald Trump and his administration are angling to create a Space Force, a sixth branch of the military that sounds straight out of a sci-fi movie. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence set a deadline for its creation: \\"Our administration will soon take action to implement these recommendations with the objective of establishing the United States Department of the Space Force by the year 2020,\\" Pence announced. Neither the White House nor the Pentagon can create a Space Force without the approval of Congress, though Trump has pushed for the plan many times since becoming president. At a meeting of the National Space Council on June 16, Trump said, \\"we are going to have the Air Force, and we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal.\\" The idea is part of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law in December and defines the force as \\"a separate military department responsible for the national security space activities.\\" It asks the Defense Department to submit a final plan for its structure and functions by December 31. But retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly — a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, four-time space-flyer, and the identical twin brother of the former astronaut Scott Kelly — doesn't support the plan, and some members of Congress have also voiced their distaste for the idea. \\"This is a dumb idea. The Air Force does this already. That is their job,\\" Mark Kelly tweeted in June, following Trump's remarks. \\"What's next, we move submarines to the 7th branch and call it the 'under-the-sea force?'\\" Kelly reiterated that point yesterday. \\"There is a threat out there but it's being handled by the US Air Force today,\\" he said during an MSNBC interview, according to Reuters. \\"[It] doesn't make sense to build a whole other level of bureaucracy in an incredibly bureaucratic DoD.\\" Why the US already has a Space Force An augmented-reality demonstration by the Air Force Space Command. USAF Kelly was referring to the Air Force Space Command, though the group has had different names over the years. Space Command is headquartered in Colorado, and its responsibilities include supporting military use of satellites, rocket launches, and cyberwarfare operations. The group also helps track the countless pieces of space junk and debris around Earth that pose a persistent threat to anything in orbit. Space Command is managed by US Strategic Command, one of 10 groups that direct major pieces of the Defense Department. Its responsibilities include oversight of the country's nuclear-weapons capabilities, which involves space because long-range, nuclear-tipped missiles fly through space. In July 2016, Space Command even announced the creation of a Space Mission Force, which military leadership said was akin to an expeditionary force. Red dots are known pieces of China's destroyed FY-1C satellite. Green dots are low-Earth orbit satellites. Celestrak/Analytical Graphics, Inc. This force was created in part to quickly respond to outer-space attacks from adversaries. The main countries of concern are Russia, which continues to publicize new weaponry, and China, which destroyed one of its own satellites in a 2007 test with a \\"kill vehicle\\" — essentially a giant bullet launched by missile. \\"Despite world interest in avoiding militarization of space, potential adversaries have identified the use of space as an advantage for US military forces, and are actively fielding systems to deny our use of space in a conflict,\\" Gen. John E. Hyten, the commander of US Strategic Command, wrote in a white paper about the decision in 2016, when he led Space Command. The Trump administration wants to peel these space-related capabilities from the Air Force, however, and form a new division entirely. For and against a Space Force Sen. Bill Nelson. Aaron Bernstein/Reuters Some members of Congress, especially those in the House of Representatives, appear warm to the idea. \\"As we get all these briefings about what adversaries are doing, our dependence on space, it's clear that we have to do better,\\" Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters in early June, according to Space News. \\"Organizational changes don't fix all the problems. But on the other hand, they can sometimes help make sure space gets the kind of priority it should have, like cyber, as a domain of warfare.\\" But others in Congress — and apparently some high-ranking military officials — have, like Kelly, questioned and pushed back on the idea of a Space Force. \\"The president told a US general to create a new Space Force as 6th branch of military today, which generals tell me they don't want,\\" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida tweeted on June 18. \\"Thankfully the president can't do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many important missions at stake.\\" Stationing or testing any weapons of mass destruction in space, including nuclear weapons, is banned by the United Nations' Outer Space Treaty of 1967. While peaceful use and exploration is permitted, smaller-scale weapons are not explicitly barred, and experts fear that militarizing space with them could stoke a costly new arms race. A war in space might also lead to something called a Kessler event. In this scenario, uncontrolled space debris could collide and create even more uncontrolled space debris, ultimately shutting off human access to space for decades, if not centuries.

The idea could require the U.S. to withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which prohibits the deployment of weapons of mass destruction but not conventional arms in space. Russia has pledged severe repercussions if President Donald Trump’s order to set up a new, space-oriented military branch violates a treaty banning nuclear weapons in the cosmos.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

The situation on the Korean Peninsula has been volatile and unpredictable for decades, and while recent developments, such as the historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, may signal a new era of cooperation, there are still significant obstacles to overcome. Factors that contribute to the complexity of this issue include: 1. Historical tensions: The Korean Peninsula has been divided since the end of World War II and the Korean War. Trust between the North and the South, as well as between North Korea and the United States, has been exceedingly low due to the long-standing animosity. 2. Political and ideological differences: North Korea is a totalitarian regime, while South Korea and the United States are democracies with different political systems and ideologies. This creates potential obstacles in aligning interests and finding mutually agreeable resolutions. 3. Military concerns: North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons and missiles, which has increased tensions and raised concerns about regional security. Additionally, the joint US-South Korea military exercises have been a point of contention for North Korea. 4. Economic sanctions: International sanctions against North Korea have been in place for years, making it difficult for the country to develop economically. A resolution would likely require some form of sanctions relief, which may be controversial and difficult to negotiate. 5. Unpredictable leadership: Both North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump are known for their unpredictable behavior, which makes it difficult to forecast the outcome of diplomatic efforts. Given these challenges and unpredictable factors, it is not possible to determine an exact timeline for reaching a resolution between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States.

With its lack of a big-name cast, and the Strause brothers' proven willingness to embrace bleakness, ...Skyline holds out - and then fulfils - its promise of anything goes, from the mesmerising intro to the bitter, bananas end. 10.

What is the consensus?","response":"The consensus is that Skyline is not a good movie.

A well-known Serbian gangster, killed in the internecine political squabbles of the post-Communist era, is buried just across the way. Around the corner is the last resting place of Ivan Stambolic, a former president of Serbia murdered by thugs allied to his protégé and later rival Slobodan Milosevic. Like the politician and the gangster, Ana met a violent death, testimony to a dark decade in Serbian politics. On March 23, 1994, at the height of the Bosnia war, she killed herself with a ceremonial pistol that had been presented to her father when he graduated from his military academy. Her suicide was a major event in Mladic’s life that is key to understanding his dark and complicated personality. By all accounts, the Bosnian Serb commander never quite recovered from Ana’s death. According to his lawyer and family friend, Milos Saljic, Mladic \\"worshipped his daughter, and she worshipped him.\\" He made several secret visits to Ana’s grave during the years that he was on the run, after being indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal for genocide and mass murder. After his arrest last May, the Serbian authorities permitted Mladic to make one final visit to the grave site before his extradition to The Hague. The precise circumstances of Ana’s death have always been mysterious. The general himself has always insisted that she was murdered by his political enemies, but that version makes little sense, and is discounted by all but a handful of Mladic loyalists. What is known for sure is that she had just returned from a visit to Moscow with her graduating class from the Belgrade University medical school. According to Saljic, while Ana was in Moscow, she talked with Bosnian Muslim students for the first time, and was shocked to learn that they considered her father a war criminal. \\"When she came back from Russia, she was a different person,\\" Saljic told me. This version — or something close to it — seems plausible to me. I am very skeptical of a claim by the German news magazine Der Spiegel last September that Ana killed herself following an argument with a former boyfriend, identified only as \\"Goran M.\\" According to Der Spiegel‘s account, Goran was a human rights activist in Belgrade who worked as a doctor in a local hospital. Other Belgrade human rights activists (a tight-knit circle) say they never heard of such a person, and doubt that he exists. Saljic confirms that Ana had a boyfriend, but says he was close to the Mladic family, had nothing to do with her death, and was neither a doctor nor a human rights activist. The conspiracy theory preferred by Mladic — that his daughter was murdered — is undermined by the pathologist who carried out the official autopsy. Now Serbia’s minister of health, Zoran Stankovic told me that he was eager to do a full investigation into the circumstances of Ana’s death, but Mladic refused permission. Had Mladic suspected foul play at the time, it seems most unlikely that he would have declined Stankovic’s request to carry out an investigation. Whatever Ana’s real motivation for killing herself, her death had a shattering effect on Mladic. Video taken at the time shows him struggling to control his emotions in public, only to weep inconsolably over his daughter’s coffin (at 1:35 in the YouTube video below). According to Saljic, Mladic suffered a serious stroke several weeks after his daughter’s death, and was unable to work for at least two months. His aides managed to conceal the general’s illness, and his disappearance from public view. It was reported at the time that Mladic had fallen out with the Bosnian Serb political leadership. When he reappeared in August 1994, journalists noted that he looked pale and tired. As Mladic’s defense lawyer, Saljic has an obvious interest in painting a picture of his client’s reduced mental capacity at the time of the Srebrenica massacre a year later, in July 1995. His claims will have to be tested in court. The larger mystery is why a man who had known such tragedy in his own life was so cavalier in condemning thousands of others — fathers, husbands, sons, wives — to their deaths. ||||| He ordered many thousands of deaths and spent 14 years as a fugitive, then portrayed himself in court as a victim of conspiracies Ratko Mladić had vowed never to succumb to the humiliation he suffered on Wednesday morning, of being judged by a foreign court. He told his officers he would not be taken alive and carried a duffel bag of guns through all his years on the run to ensure he would be as good as his word. When the critical moment came however, the man who ordered many thousands of deaths could not bring himself to take his own. On 26 May 2011, when plainclothes officers from the Serbian interior ministry turned up at his final hiding place – a room in his cousin’s house in a remote northern village – the old general, enfeebled by two strokes and a heart attack, left his Heckler & Koch machine gun where he had stashed it, among his socks at the bottom of a cupboard. “I suppose people will ask why I didn’t kill myself,” he grumbled to one of his supporters weeks later in jail. “But I was not psychologically able to, and I didn’t want them to say we are family of suicides.” Play Video 1:55 Ratko Mladić, the 'butcher of Bosnia' – video profile Some 17 years earlier, in February 1994, when the Bosnian conflict was mired in a bloody stalemate, Mladić’s daughter, Ana, used his favourite pistol to shoot herself. She was in love with a doctor, who was appalled at the slaughter in Bosnia being committed in the name of the Serb nation. He would only marry her if she renounced her father. She resolved the dilemma by removing herself. Mladić never accepted that his own actions had anything to do with Ana’s death. Instead, he invented conspiracy theories which projected the blame outwards, on the historical enemies of the Serbs. His thirst for revenge redoubled. In a lifetime surrounded by death, Ana’s was one of the very few that mattered to him. 14 years a fugitive: the hunt for Ratko Mladic, the Butcher of Bosnia | Julian Borger Read more Mladić was born into conflict. His name can be translated as “warlike youth”. His father, a partisan, was killed in battle in 1945, when he was two. His mother, Stana, raised three children on her own. As a teenager, Ratko had a go at being a tinsmith’s apprentice before giving it up and dedicating his life to the Yugoslav national army. At the end of it all, after fighting in Croatia to keep a Serb-run Yugoslavia together and losing, and then fighting for a Serb-dominated Bosnia, and losing again after the death of 100,000 people, Mladić spent 14 years as a fugitive before finally losing that battle too. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters hold posters, including one of Radovan Karadžić, the Bosnian Serb former politician and convicted war criminal, as they wait for the verdict against Ratko Mladić. Photograph: Michel Porro/Getty Images “You have found who you’re looking for,” he told the officers from the war crimes unit who had come to find him. Mladić sat in a rumpled black peaked cap in the back of the car on the drive south back to Belgrade. Once there, he had two requests for the judge. He wanted to go to his mother’s grave in Bosnia, and to Ana’s grave in Belgrade. The judge granted the second request. While government officials stood waiting to fly him to The Hague, he stood before her gravestone mumbling words to his daughter. In his six years in detention in the seafront Hague suburb of Scheveningen, and through his more than 500 days in court at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Mladić has portrayed himself as a victim of foreign conspiracies to do down the Serb people. It is this cult of victimhood that powered his brand of aggressive nationalism. It proved a rocket fuel for sadism. He repeatedly portrayed his “ethnic cleansing” campaign in Bosnia, targeted overwhelmingly against Muslim Bosniaks, as revenge for the Ottoman empire. In July 1995, when he strode with his military aides into Srebrenica, which had supposedly been a “safe haven” under UN protection which failed to materialise, he declared his “victory” as vengeance for an ancient massacre of Serbs at the hands of “the Turks”. He was filmed patting eight-year-old Izudin Alić on the head, handing the hungry Bosniak boy a chocolate bar and assuring the people of Srebrenica they would be safe. Within a few days, the boy’s father would be tracked down and killed by Mladić’s troops, along with more than 7,000 Bosniak men and teenage boys. Srebrenica genocide: worst massacre in Europe since the Nazis Read more For more than seven years, long after the bones of the dead had been dug out of mass graves, and the crimes of Mladić’s army had been laid out for the world to witness, Serbia’s army looked after him in the name of ethnic solidarity in the face of a hostile world. The fragile fiction in Bosnia, as in eastern Ukraine today, was that Bosnian Serb forces were freedom fighters thirsting for their independence. In fact, they operated with the guidance and support of a stronger neighbour, Slobodan Milošević’s regime in Belgrade. Mladić and other Bosnian Serb officers were paid by the 30th Personnel Centre of the Yugoslav army, run from Belgrade. And when Nato peacekeepers and western intelligence agencies operating in Bosnia began to get serious about tracking down war crimes suspects in 1997, Mladić was sheltered and catered for in army recreation compounds across Serbia. “The Serbian government and army were clearly protecting Mladić,” said John Sipher, a former CIA officer who took part in the hunt for war crimes suspects when he was stationed in the Balkans. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ratko Mladić in the court of the UN tribunal in 2014. Photograph: ICTY / HANDOUT/EPA “I remember Montenegrins telling us about trips he made down there to see old friends in the military. He was clearly being protected and felt comfortable living in Serbia.” The CIA was aware Mladić spent some of his time as one of Europe’s most wanted men in his own house in a wealthy Belgrade suburb where some US embassy employees lived. There was nothing the agency could do. After Milošević fell in 2000, the country’s new prime minister, Zoran Đinđić, offered the US and the UK the option of going to grab Mladić with their own troops. But Đinđić did not control the army, and the allies declined the offer rather than risk a gunfight on the strength of an uncertain tip-off from a precariously positioned politician. Đinđić himself was assassinated in 2003. Timeline Ratko Mladić: the long road to justice Show Hide The breakup of the former Yugoslavia The breakup of the former Yugoslavia formally begins when Slovenia and Croatia declare independence. The Serb-led Yugoslav army withdraws from Slovenia after a 10-day conflict, but the war in Croatia that followed would last until 1995. War breaks out in Bosnia Bosnian Serbs swiftly take control of more than two-thirds of Bosnia and launch the siege of Sarajevo, headed by Ratko Mladić, who becomes the Bosnian Serb army commander a month later. The siege lasts 1,460 days, during which more than 11,500 people die. Srebrenica massacre Mladić's troops capture Srebrenica, where more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed. Nato bombs Bosnian Serb positions following reports of the slaughter. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicts Mladić and Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan Karadžić on charges including genocide. Dayton agreement signed The Dayton agreement is signed, ending the war and creating two mini-states in Bosnia: a Bosnian-Serb one and a Muslim-Croat one. Mladić goes into hiding Nato peacekeepers and western intelligence agencies operating in Bosnia step up attempts to track down war crimes suspects, but Mladić is sheltered by loyalists in Serbia. He is seen attending football games and eating at Belgrade restaurants. Mladić arrested Following intense pressure from the international community on Serbia, Mladić is arrested in Serbia. He appears in court at the UN tribunal for the first time in June but refuses to enter pleas to the charges against him. At a second hearing in July, judges enter not guilty pleas on his behalf. Trial hears closing statements The trial in The Hague is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. Over 530 days, the UN tribunal hears from 591 witnesses and examines nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. During closing statements, prosecutors urge judges to convict Mladić on all counts and sentence him to life in prison. Defence attorneys call for acquittal. Mladić convicted More than 20 years after the Srebrenica massacre, the now 74-year-old Mladić is sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Delivering the verdicts, the judge said Mladić’s crimes “rank among the most heinous known to humankind and include genocide and extermination”. Eventually, even the army had to bow to control from elected civilian governments, and Mladić was forced to rely on an ever dwindling circle of loyalists. He took refuge in anonymous apartments and rural family plots. Even then however, he stayed beyond his enemies’ reach. “If you got a report that Mladić was at some place near the border where it might even be possible to go in, we had no sources that we had tested over a long time, so it would have been a complete gamble,” Sipher recalled. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Bosnian woman prays near a grave of her relative at the memorial centre of Potocari near Srebrenica. Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images In the end, Mladić was handed over by his fellow Serbs, weary of sanctions and isolation. But even with the culmination of his five-year trial and his conviction, the triumph of international justice over impunity is far from complete. Nationalism is very much back in the saddle in Serbia and the Bosnian Serb republic, along with blanket denial of war crimes. The Serbian government announced last month that a convicted war criminal, Vladimir Lazarević, released from jail in 2005 after serving two-thirds of his sentence, would be lecturing at the country’s military academy. One of the investigators in The Hague tribunal’s tracking team, which played a coordinating role in the hunt for Balkan war criminals, said he took a nostalgic motorcycle tour through Bosnia this summer and decided to make a detour to Mladić’s birthplace in the Serb-run municipality of Kalinovik. As he got off his bike, he was greeted by a two-word message spray-painted on a wall: “Mladić – Hero.” Julian Borger is the Guardian’s world affairs editor.

Lancôme's recent actions have been widely criticized and have been interpreted as the company siding with the Chinese government's oppressive policies, rather than protecting the freedom of expression and democracy of its consumers in Hong Kong. This article will examine the roots of this backlash, the community's reaction, and the potential long-term consequences for the brand. Backdrop: This current conflict traces back to 2016 when Lancôme canceled a promotional concert featuring outspoken pro-democracy singer, Denise Ho. At the time, it was reported that the brand received online backlash from Chinese social media users due to Ho's political views. In response, Lancôme quickly ended their partnership with the singer, citing \\"safety concerns\\" as their primary reason. Public Outrage: The decision to cut ties with Denise Ho was met with strong criticism from Hong Kong citizens, who accused Lancôme of bowing to pressure from mainland China and prioritizing profits over democratic values. This public backlash led to calls for boycotts of Lancôme products, with various consumer groups and activists urging the public to stand up against \\"cultural censorship\\" and choose other beauty brands that celebrate freedom of speech. Supporters of Denise Ho and democracy activists accused Lancôme of aiding in the \\"white terror\\" experienced by Hong Kong residents working in the media and entertainment industries. They argue that the beauty brand's decision might embolden other companies to suppress free speech to maintain good relations with China. Brand's Response and Consequences: To date, Lancôme has issued an apology for their actions and reaffirmed their commitment to freedom of expression, but many in the Hong Kong community remain skeptical. The controversy has had lasting consequences for the brand's image and damaged their reputation among their target demographic. Consequently, Lancôme may have lost a significant portion of its Hong Kong consumer base and empowered its competitors, as people shifted loyalty to rival beauty brands that prioritize cultural and ethical values over economic gain. Conclusion: The Lancôme controversy highlights the increasing tension between democratic values and the influences of the Chinese government. With multinational companies navigating the delicate balance between profitability and maintaining ethical standards, the relationship between democracy and capitalism is called into question. It remains to be seen how businesses, especially luxury brands, can successfully operate in Hong Kong without contributing to the suppression of freedom and democratic autonomy."},{"question":"Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the four-year coeducational federal service academy located in Orange County and which was attended by Robert Emlen Boyers, a United States Army officer and American football player and coach who served as head coach there?

The hypothesis explicitly states \\"early autumn,\\" while the \\"scattered fallen leaves\\" in the premise imply a similar time frame as leaves typically fall in the early months of autumn. However, there are a few elements that are not explicitly mentioned in either the premise or the hypothesis which makes it difficult to make a definitive conclusion. 1. Child's focus: The hypothesis states that the child is \\"looking at the sky,\\" whereas the premise does not mention the child's focus or gaze. It's possible that the child may be looking at the sky or could be focusing on something else, like the leaves or some other object in their surroundings. 2. The child's attire: The premise mentions that the child is wearing a hat, while the hypothesis does not specifically mention this detail. While this discrepancy does not directly conflict with the hypothesis, it does highlight a difference in the provided information. In conclusion, while there are several overlapping aspects between the premise and the hypothesis, the absence of crucial information in the premise, specifically regarding the child's gaze, makes it impossible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is accurate. It is plausible that the child could be looking at the sky, but without a clear indication of the child's focus, a concrete conclusion cannot be determined."},{"question":"Title: BoxWave DuoSuit (Bold Orange) Product review: The product fits nicely over my husband's cell phone and arrived in a timely manner after ordering.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term \\"protected area\\" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas. - Interstate 390 (I-390) is a northsouth auxiliary Interstate Highway located entirely within New York in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is at the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and New York State Route 17 or NY 17) in the town of Avoca. Its northern terminus is at I-490 (the Western Expressway) in Rochester. North of I-490, the expressway continues as NY 390 to the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece. I-390 connects to its parent, I-90 (the New York State Thruway), in Henrietta, a southern suburb of Rochester. The route is known as the Genesee Expressway from Avoca to I-590 in Brighton, where it becomes part of the Rochester Outer Loop. - Central New York is a term used to broadly describe the central region of New York State, roughly including the following counties and cities: Under this definition, the region has a population of about 1,177,073, and includes the Syracuse metropolitan area. The total area of the above counties is , which is slightly smaller than New Hampshire. - A provincial park (or territorial park) is a park administered by one of the provinces of a country, as opposed to a national park. They are similar to state parks in other countries. They are typically open to the public for recreation. Their environment may be more or less strictly protected. Argentina, Belgium, Canada and South Africa are among the countries that have provincial parks. - A park is an area of natural, semi-natural, or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Conesus Lake is the westernmost of New York's eleven Finger Lakes. It is located off Interstate 390 about south of Interstate 90. - The Finger Lakes is a group of 11 long, narrow, roughly north-south lakes in a region called the Finger Lakes region in Central New York, in the United States. This region is defined as a bioregion and is a popular tourist destination. - Conesus Lake Boat Launch is a three - acre ( 1.2 ha ) state park on the east shore of Conesus Lake , one of the minor Finger Lakes , near the village of Livonia in Livingston County . The park is open from late - April to mid-October and offers a boat launch , fishing access , and picnic tables . - State or provincial parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use \\"state\\" or \\"province\\" as a political subdivision. State parks are typically established by a state to preserve a location on account of its natural beauty, historic interest, or recreational potential. There are state parks under the administration of the government of each U.S. state, and of some the Mexican states. The term is also used in the Australian state of Victoria. The Canadian equivalent term is provincial park. Similar systems of local government maintained parks exist in other countries, but the terminology varies. - Interstate 90 (I-90) is a transcontinental freeway, and the longest Interstate Highway in the United States at . Its western terminus is in Seattle, at Edgar Martinez Drive S. near Safeco Field and CenturyLink Field, and its eastern terminus is in Boston, Massachusetts, at Route 1A near Logan International Airport. I-90 crosses the Continental Divide over Homestake Pass just east of Butte, Montana. East of the Wisconsin-Illinois border, much of I-90 follows several toll roads, many of which predate the Interstate Highway system.

He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts.

The science teacher favored Neil over Samuel because Available choices: I. Neil cleaned all of the equipment after experiments.; II. Samuel cleaned all of the equipment after experiments.;","response":"The science teacher favored Neil over Samuel because Neil cleaned all of the equipment after experiments. Neil's actions demonstrated a commitment to responsibility and safety in the lab, while also showcasing a respect for the space and resources provided to the students. His attention to laboratory etiquette allowed for a more efficient use of time for both his classmates and the teacher, as the equipment was always ready for the next set of experiments. Neil's willingness to clean up after completing his experiments exhibited not only his strong work ethic, but also his thorough understanding of the importance of proper maintenance and organization within a scientific setting. Furthermore, by voluntarily carrying out this task, Neil exemplified qualities of a conscientious and mature individual, traits that are not only appreciated by teachers, but also crucial for success in any academic or professional setting. Cleaning the lab equipment requires attention to detail, which could also hint at a potential interest in future careers in science that demand precision and accuracy. On the other hand, Samuel may have neglected to clean the equipment due to a lack of understanding of the importance of lab etiquette or lack of foresight about the potential consequences of not doing so. This could be an area for improvement for Samuel if he wishes to gain the respect and trust of his teachers and peers in the future. It is important not to mistake the science teacher's favoritism for Neil as a sign of disregarding Samuel entirely. Instead, the teacher's support for Neil in this context provides an opportunity for Samuel to learn from his classmate's admirable qualities and incorporate them into his own behavior within the science classroom. By recognizing and appreciating Neil's dedication to cleaning all of the equipment after experiments, the science teacher can create a positive and productive learning environment for all students, fostering a culture of respect and accountability within the classroom."},{"question":"Math problem: Solve 93*z + 17064 = -20*z - 124*z for z. What is the solution?","response":"The given equation is 93*z + 17064 = -20*z - 124*z. First, we need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with the same variable (z) on the right side. -20z and -124z are both z terms, so we combine them: -20z - 124z = -144z Now the equation looks like this: 93*z + 17064 = -144*z Next, we need to isolate z by getting all the z terms on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. To do this, we will add 144z to both sides of the equation, which will eliminate the z term from the right side: 93z + 144z + 17064 = -144z + 144z 93z + 144z + 17064 = 0 Combining 93z and 144z gives us: 237z + 17064 = 0 Now, we need to isolate z by moving the constant term (17064) to the other side of the equation. We will do this by subtracting 17064 from both sides: 237z + 17064 - 17064 = 0 - 17064 This simplifies to: 237z = -17064 Finally, we solve for z by dividing both sides by 237: z = -17064 / 237 Using a calculator, we find that: z ≈ -71.98 Therefore, the solution to the equation 93*z + 17064 = -20*z - 124*z is approximately z ≈ -71.98."},{"question":"Translate from English to Spanish: Very often, flash card users are encountered with an error “Drive is not formatted, do you want to format it now”, when they try to access the card.

John Dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in Iowa. Bonnie & Clyde kill two highway patrolman in Texas. BIRTHS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. DOUG: After we were rather disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man,' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film, 'Tarzan and his Mate,' was the best in the series. It's true. I got a huge kick out of this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging, animal dueling wild super-hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love Jane (who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). In my review for 'Ape Man,' I stomped on Jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but she's redeemed herself for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. She acts as the ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets. She's even got her own jungle scream now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She's totally got him trained. Cheeta is quite charming as well, taking drags off of Martin's cigarette. The plot is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhinos. The effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely. Oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Very exciting stuff. KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure, nothing holds a candle to 'Tarzan and His Mate.' The inevitable sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man is a kick-ass, violent and risqué jungle epic. I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does. You'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be Code-approved, or Animal Rights-approved for that matter. The gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies. And after T&J enter the picture, there's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims. See it for yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this film. In the first film, Jane seemed like a walking contradiction, like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that. But here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema. Although she still requires Tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams, she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued. Her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I watched this with my Mom, and I enjoyed pointing out to her just how much Jane has Tarzan \\"trained,\\" as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She totally has the ape man at her every beck and call. Although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film, there is still plenty of hair-raising Tarzan vs. predator battles that are performed (mostly) for real. That and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around. **SPOILER** The film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two humans still breathing.

If you already have a license from another state, you will not have to take the written or driving tests to get a Florida license. For the record, you have 30 days after filing the Declaration of Domicile to get a Florida driver's license (you may get a Florida license with or without this declaration, which we’ll discuss in the second section). To get your license: Bring your out-of-state license to your local Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (county tax collector). Take an identify document with you too, such as the original or certified copy of your birth certificate. It's also okay to bring a US Passport, or a Certificate of Naturalization. Provide proof of your Social Security number. This could be your Social Security card, a W-2 or pay stub. Offer two documents that prove your Florida address. A mortgage deed, Florida car registration or recent utility bills are the most commonly accepted, but anything with your new address should suffice. If you don’t intend to drive, you need to get a Non-Driver ID card. This is the same exact process as getting a Driver’s License (without any tests, of course). Transfer your car title and get registration for your car ‘’in Florida’’. You have 10 days after establishing Florida residency status to complete this task. Get car insurance in Florida. Submit proof of your policy to the county tax collector. Show the original title to the county tax collector. Bring the car you want to register to your county tax collector's office, so they can check out the VIN. Pay the fees. It costs around 400 to title and register your car for the first time in Florida. You will also have to pay the typical registration fees, which vary depending the age, type, and weight of your vehicle. It is convenient to do this while getting your Florida driver's license – often at the DMV (county tax collector) they will attach a voter registration form along with your new address forms. However, you can also register with the Supervisor of Election. You must wait until the voter registration books open, as they close 30 days prior to an election and reopen after an election. This is a simple form that takes about 5 minutes to fill out. After you hand it in, your work is done. It's as simple as that!","response":"To get a Florida driver's license or Non-Driver ID, bring your out-of-state license and identification documents to your local Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles office, provide proof of your Social Security number and Florida address, and complete any necessary forms."},{"question":"Write some highlights for the following article: Leading liberal Senator Bernie Sanders has admitted he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's long-expected run at the White House. Mr Sanders, an independent from Vermont, could pose a challenge from the left to Clinton - widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, despite not yet declaring her candidacy. Speaking to NBC's 'Meet the Press' show on Sunday, Mr Sanders said he will be using the key battleground state of Iowa to help him test whether there is an appetite for a liberal but independent candidate. If running as a Democrat gave him a better chance of success however, he would challenge Mrs Clinton. Scroll down for video. Liberal Senator Bernie Sanders (right) has confirmed he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's (left) long-expected run at the White House. Mr Sanders, 73, is currently serving his second six-year term in the Senate. He has cultivated a following among some American liberals,. especially on economic issues like the growing income disparity. between rich and poor and corporate greed. He is a. self-described socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the. Senate. 'I am thinking about running for president,' Mr Sanders said. 'I think anybody who speaks to the needs of the working class and the middle class of this country and shows the courage to take on the billionaire class, I think that candidate will do pretty well,' he added. Socialist: Bernie Sanders has cultivated a following among some American liberals - especially on economic issues like the growing income disparity between rich and poor and corporate greed. Mr Sanders denied he was considering standing in order to hamper Mrs Clinton's campaign, saying he has 'a lot of respect' for her, adding 'the issue is not Hillary.' Mr Sanders is testing the waters in Iowa, a state that holds an. important early contest in the nomination process. 'One of the reasons I'm going to Iowa is to get a sense of. how people feel about it,' he said of his candidacy. 'Look, the. truth is [there is] profound anger at both political parties,. more and more people are becoming independent. The negative is:. how do you set up a 50-state infrastructure as an independent?' Relaxed: Hillary Clinton (pictured alongside her husband former U.S. President Bill Clinton) is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, despite not yet formally declaring her candidacy. With Mrs Clinton mindful of the need to appeal to moderates in. any general election battle against a Republican in 2016, a. Sanders candidacy could force her to the left in the Democratic. primaries to head off his challenge. Conversely, if he runs in the general election as an. independent, he could siphon away from her votes from liberals. that she could need to beat any Republican nominee. American liberals have expressed disappointment with. President Barack Obama on a range of issues, most recently on. his decision to postpone any executive action on immigration. This comes even as Republican leaders in the House of Representatives block. action on a bipartisan Senate-passed plan. Mr Sanders said that he has 'a lot of disagreements' with. Obama, adding: 'I think he has not tapped the anger and the. frustration that the American people feel on many, many issues.' Bernie Sanders, 73, is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, having been elected to Vermont's at-large congressional district in 1990. Born into a family of Polish Jewish immigrants in New York in 1941, he was involved in student activism before entering politics with the anti-Vietnam War Liberty Union Party in Vermont. In 1981, at the suggestion of his friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont, Sanders ran for Mayor of Burlington and defeated six-term Democratic incumbent Gordon Paquette by 14 votes in a four-way contest. Sanders won three more terms, defeating both Democratic and Republican candidates. In his final run for Mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated a candidate endorsed by both major parties. Veteran: 73-year-old Bernie Sanders is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, having been elected to Vermont's at-large congressional district in 1990. He temporarily retired from politics in 1989, teaching political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1989 while making an unsuccessful run at Vermont's at-large congressional district. Sanders was elected at his second attempt, defeating Republican incumbent Lieutenant Governor Peter Smith to become the first independent in Congress for 40 years. In 1991, Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and chaired the grouping of mostly liberal Democrats. He continues to caucus with the Democratic Party and is counted as a Democrat for purposes of committee assignments. During his time in Congress, Sanders built a reputation for progressive Liberalism proposing a number of radical socialist policies, voting against the use of force in both Iraq wars, and becoming an outspoken critic of the administration of George W Bush in the 2000s. Republicans have attacked Sanders as 'an ineffective extremist' for successfully sponsoring only one law and 15 amendments in his eight terms in the House. Sanders responded by saying that he had passed 'the most floor amendments of any member of the House since 1996'. In 2006 Sanders was elected to the U.S. Senate in the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history. He was reelected in 2012 with 71 per cent of the vote. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and has repeatedly praised Scandinavian-style social democracy.","response":"Senator Bernie Sanders, a leading liberal figure, is considering running for U.S. president in 2016, which could complicate Hillary Clinton's long-anticipated run for the White House.

Sanders is using Iowa, a state with a significant early contest in the nomination process, to test the waters and gather public opinion on his potential candidacy. He acknowledges the challenges of setting up a 50-state infrastructure as an independent. A Sanders candidacy could push Clinton to adopt a more left-leaning platform during the Democratic primaries to fend off his challenge. On the other hand, if Sanders runs as an independent during the general election, he may take away liberal votes that Clinton needs to win against a Republican nominee. American liberals have been disappointed with President Barack Obama's administration on numerous issues, the latest being the postponement of executive action on immigration. Sanders has expressed his disagreement with Obama on various matters, stating that the President has failed to adequately address the anger and frustration felt by the American people on many issues.

Let's break down and discuss each aspect of the phrase in detail. 1. Cruelly funny: The word 'cruelly' has a negative connotation, indicating that the humor stems from a sense of cruelty or harshness. This could be perceived as negative, as some people might find this type of humor offensive or inappropriate. However, the word 'funny' serves as a positive aspect, pointing out that the comedy is still meant to be entertaining and elicit laughter. Hence, the intended humor might appeal to those who enjoy dark or mature comedy, giving it a positive spin. 2. Twist on teen comedy: The phrase 'twist on teen comedy' suggests that the creators are trying something different or innovative with the genre, altering the classic elements of teen movies. This can be considered positive since it might provide the audience with a refreshing experience or a new perspective on familiar themes. However, the twist might also cause a divide among viewers, depending on their tastes and preferences for genre experimentation. Taking both aspects into account, the phrase \\"a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy\\" offers a mixture of positive and negative connotations. It is positive in the sense that it presents a unique and potentially entertaining take on the genre, while the negative aspect lies in the possibility of alienating certain audiences who may find the humor too harsh or inappropriate.

Article: Left unfettered , Anthony Konieczka, 9 years old, would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed hours later. Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy , a trend called \\"age compression \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade. Action figures, for instance, used to be considered healthy for boys up to age 12. Now the items are mainly marketed to boys 4 to 6. A recent study found that...

In this case, the transliteration for \\"Itaparica, Bahia\\" would be \\"Итапарика, Баия.\\" Now, let's provide a detailed explanation of the transliteration: 1. The Portuguese name \\"Itaparica\\" is comprised of the following sounds: /i/, /t/, /a/, /p/, /a/, /ɾ/, /i/, /k/, and /a/. To transliterate these sounds into Russian, we'd write: - /i/ as И - /t/ as Т - /a/ as А - /p/ as П - /ɾ/ as Р (the Russian \\"Р\\" is a voiced trill, similar to a Portuguese \\"R\\" in certain positions) - /k/ as К So, \\"Itaparica\\" becomes \\"Итапарика\\" in Russian. 2. For \\"Bahia,\\" we'll start with the Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation, which sounds like /baˈia/. To transliterate this into Russian, we'd write: - /b/ as Б - /a/ as А - /i/ as И - /a/ as А Thus, \\"Bahia\\" is written as \\"Баия\\" in Russian. As a result, \\"Itaparica, Bahia\\" would be expressed as \\"Итапарика, Баия\\" in Russian. It's important to note that the city and the state are still referred to by their Portuguese names in Russian conversations and texts, but they are simply respelled using the Cyrillic alphabet and adjusted for accurate Russian pronunciation. Please note that Russian speakers may still understand the original spelling in Latin script, especially when discussing international locations or during interactions with foreign speakers of Portuguese or other non-Russian languages."},{"question":"How to start free running<br>You need to start off slow and small.

It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has...

(Associated Press) National Park Service archaeologists are sampling sediment, sucking up mud and water about 10 feet deep with an aluminum tube and then dumping the contents over a screen. When the pond was dredged in 1968 after a record drought, a park ranger noticed hundreds of artifacts, including bone pieces sharpened into tools or weapons, atop a debris pile. The items were collected and the ranger's notes were catalogued, but the site never was excavated. Archaeologists have returned because the park service wants to replace part of the wooden boardwalk along the Anhinga Trail. The boardwalk allows tourists to experience the landscape without wading through water or stumbling upon alligators. More than four decades ago, the ranger also found stingray tails, shark teeth and scales from other marine life that would not be found in a freshwater pond, said Margo Schwadron, the park service archaeologist leading the survey. \\"It's unique in the sense that it's a submerged site. We don't have very many of those in Florida and in this area at all. That is why it's special,\\" said Penny Del Bene, the park's chief of cultural resources. Schwadron hopes the dredging 46 years ago didn't destroy a prehistoric cultural site. Based on what the ranger found in 1968, the artifacts hidden potentially thousands of years could be significant to understanding how people lived in the Everglades, she said. \\"There's no written record. The only thing we can find is archaeological data and get that and preserve that,\\" Schwadron said. The work began Friday. As of Monday, archaeologists sifting through the sediment samples with their hands have found burnt pieces of wood, bone fragments and shells, but little else. The items were put into plastic bags filled with yellow-brown water to keep them from drying out before they can be examined in a lab for evidence of human alteration, like cuts or drilled holes. The painstaking work is made more difficult by the watery work site, which has no clear boundaries in an area well-trafficked by tourists and wildlife. \\"We have no idea what we're hitting until we bring it up,\\" Schwadron said. The site is near a slough that has been a target for Everglades restoration efforts. State and federal officials consult with Florida's tribes on how to preserve artifacts or cultural sites affected by restoration projects in the park and on state lands. The location of those sites is often kept secret to prevent looting; anyone who finds an artifact is urged to report its location and leave it undisturbed. Tourists are warned that anything dropped into the Everglades is more than likely gone for good, but the flowing waters and annual dry seasons sometimes reveal lost treasures. A hunter participating in the state-sanctioned python hunt last year found a half-melted gold pendant that may have belonged to someone aboard a commercial airliner that crashed in the swamps decades ago. ___ Follow Jennifer Kay on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jnkay. ||||| Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter HOMESTEAD (CBSMiami/AP) – The replacement of an old wooden boardwalk has been put on hold as archaeologists poke and prod near a muddy pond located inside the Everglades National Park. The scientists are looking for evidence of a prehistoric culture. National Park Service archaeologists began work on Friday along a 0.8-mile trail around a shallow pond amid sawgrass. On Monday, the team started sampling sediment down about 10 feet to the bedrock every 5 meters along the boardwalk. They are using an aluminum tube to suck up mud and water, and dump the contents over a screen. The park service knows the pond has history and doesn’t want cultural resources damaged during the construction of the boardwalk. In 1968 a park ranger noticed hundreds of artifacts in the pond after it was dredged because of a record drought. The ranger collected and cataloged the items, but the site was never excavated. “It’s unique in the sense that it’s a submerged site. We don’t have very many of those in Florida and in this area at all. That is why it’s special,” said Penny Del Bene, the park’s chief of cultural resources. The ranger found hundreds of bone pieces sharpened into tools or weapons, probably to spear fish or other wildlife, along with stingray tails, shark teeth and scales from other marine life that would not be found in a freshwater pond, said Margo Schwadron, the park service archaeologist leading the survey. She hopes the dredging 46 years ago didn’t destroy a prehistoric cultural site. Based on what the ranger found in 1968, the artifacts hidden potentially thousands of years could be significant to understanding how people lived in the Everglades, she said. “There’s no written record. The only thing we can find is archaeological data and get that and preserve that,” Schwadron said. Though the ranger noted several interesting pieces in 1968, today’s archaeologists have only found burnt pieces of wood, bone fragments and shells.

RELATED CONTENT: ||||| Archeologists are heading to the Everglades this week to look for the remnants of a Native American settlement. The National Park Service is trying to find the location of a settlement discovered back in the late 1960’s and then lost. The Anhinga Trail is located closer to the main entrance of Everglades National Park, where tourists flock each year. For centuries, the Everglades has been home to a wide array of plants and animals, but it has also been home to humans. In the 1968, a dredging operation of Anhinga Slough revealed artifacts like bone tools that may have been used as hunting weapons. But Margo Schwadron with the National Park Services’ Southeast Archeological Center says both the site, and the artifacts, were eventually lost to time. “The site didn’t get recorded as we would today,\\" Schwadron says. \\"We didn’t have GPS. And we basically just have the ranger’s old field notes that talk about this discovery and we don’t know where the site was, other than what he drew on some sketch maps.” Everglades officials now preparing to rebuild a bridge that winds through Anihinga Slough, but before any construction gets underway, the National Park Service wants to have a look at the area and see what lies beneath the water. Using the old notes and sketch maps, they’re hoping to find the site where the artifacts were originally found in 1968. Meanwhile, the Southeast Archeological Center rediscovered the missing artifacts about seven years ago. They now reside at the Center’s Tallahassee location. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Some scientists called archaeologists are investigating an area in the Everglades National Park to search for clues from a very old culture that lived there many years ago.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

Would \\"Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories—called , or \\"fantastic tales\\"—express themes that transcend age and nationality.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","response":"Before Hans Christian Andersen became a successful writer, he held various jobs that contributed to his experiences and skills. Some of these jobs include: 1. Tailor's apprentice: Andersen began working as a tailor's apprentice when he was a young boy, learning the craft and making a living. 2. Actor: Andersen initially aspired to be an actor before he turned his attention to writing. At the age of 14, he moved to Copenhagen to pursue a career on the stage, where he received a small part in one of the Royal Theatre's productions. 3. Singer: In addition to acting, Andersen was also known for his singing abilities. He joined the Royal Danish Theatre's boy's choir and received financial support from the Head of the Theatre, Jonas Collin, who later became Andersen's lifelong mentor. 4. Educated student: After failing to succeed in acting and singing, Andersen attended grammar school in Slagelse and Elsinore, where he continued his education. With Collin's support, Andersen studied at a private school for gentlemen. However, your proposed statement about Andersen's popularity and his stories being called \\"eventyr,\\" or \\"fantastic tales,\\" is accurate. His stories indeed express themes that transcend age and nationality, which is why they are loved by readers of all ages worldwide.

Possible A: bid, concentrate, winning, count, remember Why is \\"remember\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","response":"Step 1: Understand the question The question is about children playing cards and making their own rules. The reason they do this is because they can't do something with the original rules. Step 2: Analyze the possible answers We have five possible answers: bid, concentrate, winning, count, and remember. We need to determine which one of these answers aligns with human common sense. Step 3: Evaluate each answer in context a) Bid: Bidding is a specific action used in some card games, but it doesn't necessarily explain why children would make their own rules. b) Concentrate: Concentration is necessary for following rules, but it is not clearly tied to the idea of understanding or following the original card game rules. c) Winning: Winning is an outcome of playing a game, not an action related to understanding or following rules. d) Count: Counting may be required in some card games, but it is a skill the children could still learn. It doesn't fully explain why they would need to make their own rules. e) Remember: Remembering is the action of being able to recall or retain information, which is essential for understanding and following rules. If children can't remember the original rules, it is reasonable that they would make up their own rules to play the game. Step 4: Choose the answer that aligns with human common sense \\"Remember\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense, as it explains why children would need to make their own rules if they can't recall the original ones.

After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of Blackpool, in 1932 he was signed by First Division Manchester City, with whom he played his entire professional career. Swift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2-1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. During the Second World War, Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the British Army, and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the Army School of Physical Training as part of a scheme devised by the FA. The school was based near Aldershot F.C. leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included Matt Busby, Jimmy Hagan, Joe Mercer, Stan Cullis, Cliff Britton and Tommy Lawton. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including Liverpool. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at Ninian Park, Swift played for a Western Command XI against a Cardiff City XI which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for Royal Artillery prisoners of war. In April 1944 in Edinburgh he played for a British Army XI that included Jack Rowley, Leslie Compton, Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a Royal Air Force XI that included Peter Doherty, Stanley Matthews and Ted Drake. The Army won 4-0. On 9 September 1944 at Windsor Park he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8-4 win against Ireland. This team was in effect a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, Raich Carter and Stan Mortensen. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against France and Belgium. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour. In the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when Alex Williams broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985. By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the 1948-49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When did he join the war?","response":"Frank Victor Swift joined the British Army during the Second World War. Although the exact date of his enlistment is not mentioned in the article, it can be inferred that he joined the war sometime after it began in September 1939. He continued to play regularly for Manchester City during the war, also guesting for several other clubs and representative sides during this time."},{"question":"Given the following context: Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously.

Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a \\"frightful smell\\", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible.

Williamson later called Hadley's suspicions \\"hallucinations and absolutely untrue.\\" Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of Dominion Day. Later in the month the party's spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a 600-pound (270 kg) walrus, which provided fresh meat for several days.

The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome.

Allen can now breathe under water as he is in the hands of a mermaid. However, Allen is pulled to the surface by the deck hands and the two are separated, though apparently no one else sees the girl. After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy). Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy). After Allen is left alone when his motorboat conks out, he again falls into the sea, and is knocked out when the boat hits his head. He wakes up with a headache on a beach, where he encounters a beautiful naked woman with long blonde hair, a necklace with a lion medal, and the inability to talk (Daryl Hannah) who, unknown to him, is the mermaid he met as a boy (her tail transforms into legs when it becomes dry). After kissing him, she dives into the sea and leaves Allen to return home. Kornbluth, while diving in order to seek proof of strange sea creatures, also encounters the mermaid in her sea form, causing him to become obsessed with finding her again.

The existing transportation infrastructure, which primarily consists of an old subway system, a limited network of trams, and a small fleet of buses, is struggling to accommodate an ever-expanding population, resulting in overcrowded trains, buses, and trams. Consequently, the situation has led to long waiting times, increased traffic, a decline in air quality, and dissatisfaction among the city's inhabitants. Recognizing the detrimental effects insufficient public transportation has on the city's development, the local government decides to seek help from urban planners and transportation experts. They are exploring potential solutions to expand the city's transportation system and meet its growing needs. Hypothesis: A multi-modal transportation system that incorporates new, technology-advanced public transportation options, such as automated trams and electric buses, alongside the integration of cycling and walking paths in the city, may significantly improve the transportation capacity and efficiency. This will result in reduced waiting times, less congested roads, better air quality, and a more satisfied population in the long run. To support this hypothesis, the following actions could be undertaken: 1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current transportation infrastructure, identifying areas of concern and opportunities for improvement. 2. Develop a strategic plan to expand and upgrade the existing public transportation options, working with specialized agencies and engineers to design and implement new automated trams and electric buses. 3. Leverage smart city technologies, such as IoT, AI, and data analytics, to help optimize routes, improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance communication between different transportation modes. 4. Encourage active transportation by creating a comprehensive network of cycling and walking infrastructure, including dedicated bike lanes, walking paths, and pedestrian-friendly zones throughout the city. 5. Develop an extensive community outreach program to engage the public in the planning process and educate them on the environmental, health, and economic benefits of sustainable transportation. 6. Implement an incentive program to promote the use of public transportation, cycling, or walking for commuting, such as discounts, loyalty programs, and partnerships with local businesses. 7. Establish an ongoing monitoring and reporting system, allowing the local government to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the multi-modal transportation system over time. By pursuing these actions, the local government can gradually address the transportation challenges faced by the growing city. Moreover, introducing a multi-modal system will provide citizens with a diverse range of options for their commuting needs, enhancing their quality of life and contributing to the city's sustainable development in the long term."},{"question":"Write a sentence that about [Aarhus Airport LOCATION Tirstrup; Tirstrup COUNTRY Denmark; Tirstrup IS_PART_OF Central Denmark Region; Denmark LEADER_NAME Margrethe II of Denmark].","response":"Aarhus Airport, located in the scenic town of Tirstrup within the Central Denmark Region, serves as one of the prominent airports in Denmark and plays a crucial role in the country's transportation infrastructure under the reign of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark."},{"question":"Add punctuation: A part of the series Europisk litteratur 15001800 1 and the subject areas Literature and History","response":"A part of the series, Europisk Litteratur 1500-1800, is 1, and the subject areas are: Literature and History.

For most of their history the band consisted of Sting (lead vocals, bass guitar, primary songwriter), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums, percussion). The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s and are generally regarded as one of the first new-wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. They are also considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the United States. In October 1979, the group released their second album, Reggatta de Blanc, which topped the UK Albums Chart, and became the first of five consecutive UK No. 1 albums. The album spawned the hit singles \\"Message in a Bottle\\" (No. 1 UK, No. 2 Canada, No. 5 Australia) and \\"Walking on the Moon\\" (No. 1 UK). The album's singles failed to dent the US top 40, but Reggatta de Blanc still hit No. 25 on the US album charts. The band's first live performance of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" was on the BBC's television show Rock Goes to College filmed at Hatfield Polytechnic College in Hertfordshire. The instrumental title track \\"Regatta de Blanc\\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In February 1980, the single \\"So Lonely\\" was re-issued in the UK. Originally a non-charting flop when first issued in late 1978, upon re-release the track became a UK top 10 hit, peaking at No. 6. In March 1980, the Police began their first world tour, which included places that had seldom hosted foreign performers---including Mexico, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Greece, and Egypt. The tour was subsequently documented in the film The Police Around the World (1982), directed by Kate and Derek Burbidge, which encompasses footage shot by Anne Nightingale originally intended for a BBC production The Police in the East. In May 1980, A&M in the UK released Six Pack, a package containing the five previous A&M singles (not including \\"Fall Out\\") in their original sleeves plus a mono alternate take of the album track \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" backed with a live version of \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\".

Rob Cooper. PUBLISHED:. 04:11 EST, 4 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 04:30 EST, 4 June 2012. Internet taunts: Rebecca Adlington, 23, re-Tweeted an abusive message sent to her - horus after winning another event in Barcelona. Olympic champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington has outed a Twitter troll who sent her an abusive message online - days after complaining about being subjected to vile taunts. The 23-year-old was called a 'whale' with a 'shark fin nose' in the abusive Tweet, she revealed yesterday hours after scooping gold in the 800m freestyle in Barcelona. The message was apparently sent by Callum Aspley, a 19-year-old Leeds Metropolitan University undergraduate who is himself a keen sportsman. However, he has denied sending it at 11pm on a Saturday night – and blamed it on one of his friends. Miss Adlington re-Tweeted the message for her 51,000 followers to see and said it was a ‘perfect example’ of the abuse she has had to endure. The swimmer, who won the 400m and 800m freestyle events at the Beijing Olympics, has vowed to ignore the internet altogether during this summer’s games. The abusive message said: ‘you shark fin nosed ******** , you belong in that pool you ****ing whale.’ Yesterday she received a stream of supportive Tweets from her followers. One fan wrote: ‘Becky, that's just a lowlife - ignore him because you know how talented you are x’ Miss Adlington, a 400m and 800m freestyle champion, revealed last week she has received a number of vile messages from 'idiots'. She said: ‘I used to read all the stuff about me. I learned very quickly not to do that. ‘It is awful. Even if there are ten nice comments you get one idiot. I’ve now given up. It upsets me or gets me angry. ‘They are to do with how I look, which has nothing to do with my performance in the pool. It’s just nasty comments about things I can’t control. I can’t help the way I look.’ She said: ‘I don’t know how people expect to send a nasty message and not get blocked. I won’t be checking Twitter or going on it a lot during the Games. Abuse: The vile message sent from @CallumAspley re-Tweeted by Rebecca Adlington as the 'perfect example' of the offensive remarks she has received. Rebecca Adlington has said she will avoid the internet completely during the Olympics. ‘The messages of support are amazing but you do have the chance of someone saying something that is going to be annoying. You don’t want that added stress. You don’t want to be thinking about that. I think I will just tweet once it is over.’ It is not the first time Miss Adlington, of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, has been publicly abused over her looks. In 2009, BBC panel show Mock The Week was censured after broadcasting ‘nasty’ comments about her by comedian Frankie Boyle. Reflecting on the BBC incident, the swimmer said: ‘It’s hard for a woman. A guy doesn’t get comments on his weight or his looks. But for women it is difficult because we get criticised for our weight or how we look.’ The double Olympic champion won gold again on Saturday in the 800m Freestyle in Barcelona in the Mare Nostrum series. She put in an assured performance and recorded a championship record time of 8 minutes 19.86 seconds. Adlington led from the front and built up a lead of over two seconds at the halfway stage, finishing strongly ahead of Spain's Mireia Garcia Belmonte, the world short-course silver medallist. Today the student behind the Twitter account that the abusive message was sent from had not yet responded to a request for comment from the MailOnline. He has however taken his Twitter page down. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I didn't send the tweet myself, I was out with my mates and one of them got hold of my phone and so he must have sent it, it wasn't me. ‘I don't use Twitter a lot and I don't know how to delete a tweet. ‘Obviously I don't agree with what was said, I wouldn't say that kind of thing.’ He added that he does not usually use Twitter and would delete the message. The undergraduate, who plays for his university rugby team, previously played rugby and cricket for his secondary school in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He has refused to name who was actually behind the abusive message. Golden girl: Rebecca Adlington celebrates with one of the two gold medals she won in Beijing four years ago.

Although Germany had been desperate to introduce anti-aircraft missile systems, none became operational during World War II. Following several years of post-war development, however, these systems began to mature into viable weapons systems. The US started an upgrade of their defences using the Nike Ajax missile, and soon the larger anti-aircraft guns disappeared. The same thing occurred in the USSR after the introduction of their SA-2 Guideline systems. The introduction of what caused the larger anti-aircraft guns to disappear in the USSR?","response":"The introduction of the Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) systems, particularly the SA-2 Guideline, caused the larger anti-aircraft guns to disappear in the Soviet Union. SAM systems, like the SA-2, presented several improvements over traditional anti-aircraft guns, making them a more effective solution for air defense. The SA-2 Guideline, known in Russian as the S-75 Dvina, was a Soviet-designed, high-altitude, medium-range SAM system capable of engaging aircraft, cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. It was first deployed in the mid-1950s and played a crucial role in shaping anti-aircraft strategy in the Cold War-era Soviet Union. The advantages of the SA-2 and other SAM systems over larger anti-aircraft guns included the following: 1. Longer Range: SAM systems, like the SA-2 Guideline, had a significantly greater range than anti-aircraft guns. The SA-2, for example, could engage targets at distances up to 30 kilometers, while traditional anti-aircraft guns typically had a shorter range. This extended reach of SAM systems allowed for broader defense coverage, making it more difficult for enemy aircraft to penetrate defended airspace. 2. Higher Maximum Altitude: Traditional anti-aircraft guns were limited in their ability to engage high-altitude targets, while SAM systems could reach higher altitudes with greater ease. The SA-2 Guideline could engage targets at altitudes up to 25 kilometers, offering better defense against high-altitude bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. 3. Improved Accuracy: SAM systems generally provided better accuracy and more effective engagement of enemy aircraft compared to anti-aircraft guns, which relied on gun crews and analog targeting systems. Guided missiles, like the SA-2, employed radar guidance and onboard electronics to track and home in on their targets, improving the likelihood of successful engagements. 4. Faster Response: SAM systems offered a quicker response time than anti-aircraft guns, as missiles could accelerate faster and reach their intended altitude more quickly. This improvement in response time made it more difficult for enemy aircraft to evade air defense systems once detected. 5. Enhanced Versatility: SAM systems were also more versatile than anti-aircraft guns, being capable of engaging multiple types of targets, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. The aforementioned benefits of SAM systems, such as the SA-2 Guideline, coupled with ongoing advancements in missile technology, ultimately led to a shift away from larger anti-aircraft guns in the Soviet Union. Instead, resources were focused on developing and deploying more effective air defense missile systems to counter evolving aerial threats, solidifying the role of SAM systems in modern anti-aircraft warfare."},{"question":"Answer the following question: M: Hi, Lynn.

Answer the above question based on the context below: A third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres (49 ft) apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new 50-metre (160 ft) moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; it was originally 4.5 metres (15 ft) deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives. Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on...

Fact 2: Animals that sleep through the winter are said to hibernate. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Why do animals sleep through winter?\\" with the following options: - To conserve energy - recovery time from fatigue - They get bored - Endocrine system - They only like warmth - dormant state - To save time - hydration","response":"Animals sleep through winter, primarily, to conserve energy. Hibernation is a survival strategy used by many animals to endure the harsh conditions of winter, when food sources become scarce and temperatures drop significantly. During hibernation, the animals' metabolic processes substantially slow down, leading to a decrease in body temperature, respiration, and heart rate. This reduction in physiological activity allows the animals to conserve energy and utilize their stored fat reserves in a more efficient manner. Since they are not actively searching for food or engaging in other day-to-day activities, they can minimize the energy spent and survive the winter months despite the environmental stressors. Additionally, hibernation serves as a way to protect the animals from extreme cold and predation. Many animals that hibernate, like bears, ground squirrels, and bats, will find sheltered dens or burrows to hunker down in for the winter season. The protection and seclusion provided by these enclosed spaces enable the hibernating animals to avoid predators and stay insulated from the harsh weather conditions outside. While the other options in the list are interesting to consider, they do not primarily answer the question of why animals sleep through winter. - Recovery time from fatigue: Although resting might aid in recovery from fatigue, it would be a disproportionate measure to sleep all winter for that sole purpose. - They get bored: Animals do not hibernate out of boredom, rather it is a result of environmental factors and an innate survival strategy. - Endocrine system: The endocrine system has a role in regulating the hibernation process but is not an answer to explain why animals hibernate. - They only like warmth: Preferring warmth might contribute to why certain animals hibernate, but conserving energy is the fundamental reason. - Dormant state: This is a synonym for hibernation but does not explain the purpose behind the behavior. - To save time: Hibernation allows animals to conserve energy during winter months, but time-saving is not the primary motivation. - Hydration: Hydration is important but not the main reason behind hibernation. Animals often have their bodily fluids partially frozen during hibernation, and hydration needs are lower due to the reduced metabolic activity. In conclusion, animals sleep through winter, or hibernate, predominantly to conserve energy and adapt to the scarcity of resources during the harsh winter months. This behavior enables them to survive periods of environmental stress and continue their life cycle when the warmer, more favorable conditions return."},{"question":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Soinaway,I’msomewhattornonwhetherIwantnational/internationalplayerpools,orifintra-state(withsmallerstatesgoinginter-state)onlinepokermightnotbringbackthe“olddays”inasense.","response":"In a way, I'm somewhat torn on whether I want national or international player pools for online poker, or if intra-state poker (with smaller states going inter-state) might not bring back the \\"old days\\" in a sense."},{"question":"Given the question: Ned learned about reactions at a higher temperature for his physics class, while Paul had to learn about reactions at lower temperatures.

He has two older sisters and a half-brother, Shane. His mother, Amanda (nee Casson), was a school secretary, and his father, William, was an insurance salesman. He attended Buckfield High School and St. Dominic Regional High School. Dempsey made a number of featured appearances in television in the 1990s; he was cast several times in pilots that were not picked up for a full season, including lead roles in the TV versions of the films The Player and About A Boy. However, he received good reviews as he portrayed real-life mob boss, Meyer Lansky in 1991 when Mobsters was put on the screen. His first major television role was a three-episode stint as Will Truman's closeted sportscaster boyfriend on Will & Grace. He went on to play the role of Aaron Brooks on Once & Again. Dempsey received an Emmy nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Aaron. In 1993, he played a young John F. Kennedy in the two-part TV mini-series JFK: Reckless Youth. In 2000, he played Detective Kincaid in Scream 3. Dempsey had a high-profile role as the fiance of Reese Witherspoon's character in Sweet Home Alabama (2002). In 2004, he co-starred in the highly acclaimed HBO production Iron Jawed Angels, opposite Hilary Swank and Anjelica Huston. He also appeared as special guest star in The Practice for its three-episode finale season (8x13-8x15). In 2007, Dempsey starred in the Disney film Enchanted, and the Paramount Pictures film Freedom Writers, where he reunited with his Iron Jawed Angels co-star Hilary Swank. He also voiced the character Kenai in Brother Bear 2, replacing Joaquin Phoenix. Dempsey's most recent roles include the 2008 film Made of Honor as Tom, and the 2010 romantic comedy Valentine's Day; the latter film follows five interconnecting stories about Los Angelinos anticipating (or in some cases dreading) the holiday of love. Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the prize-winning novel The Art of Racing in the Rain in July 2009, for Dempsey to star in. The project has not been able to find a director.

Its flavor hints at turned earth or wood broken down by rain, a funk wonderfully, perilously close to rot. Beside it is risotto, arborio rice gone cloudy and fat in white wine and a stock of fennel and artichoke scraps, finished not with cheese, but peas freshly shucked and tasting still new to the world. The two dishes emerge from the same kitchen at Dawa’s, a Tibetan and American cafe in Woodside, Queens. This feels not like a hyphenation, but a continuum: one table, one life. Dawa Bhuti runs the restaurant with her father, Ngodup Gyaltsen, and an uncle, Lobsang Tenzin. Her family roots are in Dzonga, Tibet, a village in the Himalayas at an altitude of some 13,500 feet. It is a place she has never been. She was born across the border, in Kathmandu, Nepal, and she spent much of her youth in India at boarding schools for Tibetan refugees, before coming to New York in 2004 at 20. Now she cooks alongside her father, who joined her in the United States three years ago. He used to circumambulate the city, delivering homemade lunchboxes to Tibetans working at farmers’ markets; she went to culinary school and did stints at Mercer Kitchen, Rouge Tomate and, most recently, Reynard, whose loyalty to local farms and the seasons is reaffirmed at Dawa’s. The front side of the menu, posted at each table on a small chipped clipboard, is hers, devoted to brunch dishes (served all day) of almost Californian lightness. These may include a pale soup of leeks and radishes, inscribed with basil oil like a memory of another alphabet, or baked eggs under a litter of summer squash and garlic scapes. Pan-seared wild cod, in folds of soft corn tortillas, comes armed with half-spears of asparagus. A rosary of chickpeas dusted with Ethiopian berbere is strewn among lettuce leaves so vivid, they look as if they were still beaded with dew. The cooking is lovely, if occasionally more dramatic in appearance than flavor. (An ambitiously tall fried-chicken sandwich wanted salt and a less looming, umbrella-like bun.) But the thrill is the hidden tracks, listed on the back of the menu as ethnic plates, Mr. Bhuti’s contribution from the hometown he had to leave behind. Gyuma is a stark black sausage, filled with beef blood, tripe and heart, heavy on bulgur wheat and contoured with emma, the Tibetan name for numbing Sichuan peppercorn. Under it lies a swath of sepen, the mandatory Tibetan hot sauce, as pure an expression of raw chile power as I’ve known. Ground beef is sealed inside flaking pastry disks for shabaley, the meat moist from a dash of beef bone broth, lush with marrow. Momos, Tibetan dumplings, are slightly doughier than elsewhere in town, with grainy whole-wheat skins surrounding beef sweated with shallots and more delicate white-flour skins around chicken laced with curry powder, Nepali-style. I wished everything had come with tingmo, a snowy coil of a steamed bun. It was spongy and resilient, good for softening the scorch of sepen or catching the last bit of rust-red sauce under the momos, a slow distillate of tomatoes, onion and fenugreek, bitter inextricable from sweet. Ms. Bhuti took over the Woodside storefront, formerly an outpost of Lety Bakery, last August but kept everything the same, waiting until the spring to renovate and introduce a new menu. (She still stocks the baked goods.) Now there are rustic tables and mismatched chairs, forks and knives with hammered copper handles, bulbs showing off their filaments and a potted plant growing on nearly every table. Food is presented in the kind of exquisite, idiosyncratic ceramic plates I’m used to seeing at hushed Japanese restaurants. Here, too, they give a meal an element of reverence. (A sign on a shelf says: “You like it? Inquire in the front.”) Where at other restaurants the artisanal, farm-to-table ethos can sometimes take on the gloss of fetish, for Ms. Bhuti it seems simply a natural inclination. She likes the feel of dirt on farmstand vegetables and the touch of things made by hand. She sanded down her drinking glasses from old wine bottles, and she once dressed the dining room with branches rescued from a fallen tree. Behind the restaurant, she tried to improvise an egg-carton greenhouse. “Not everything came out,” she said. She hopes one day to transform the yard into a place for dinner guests. “Secret-garden-like,” she said. “With wildflowers.” Recommended Dishes Bhutanese pork belly with tingmo; shabaley; momos; stir-fried noodles; wild cod tacos; baked eggs.

Bees play a crucial role as pollinators, facilitating the reproduction and growth of plants in a vast range of ecosystems. This, in turn, has an enormous impact on agricultural output, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. As the bee populations decline, the world is at risk of losing many species of plants, leading to reduced agricultural yield and the collapse of ecosystems as well as the loss of numerous animal species that rely on those plants for food and habitat. There are numerous factors attributed to the declining bee population, such as pesticide exposure, climate change, habitat loss, and disease. The increasing use and prevalence of insecticides, particularly neonicotinoids, have been proved harmful to bees and are highly suspected to be contributing to their death rates. Moreover, climate change has been causing alterations in plant blooming cycles, disrupting the symbiotic relationship between bees and plants, which can lead to scarcity of food and loss of habitat. Hypothesis: Implementation of bee-friendly practices can help restore the declining bee population Given the importance of bees in our ecosystem and the alarming decline in their population, it becomes crucial to implement bee-friendly practices to restore their numbers. The hypothesis suggests that adopting bee conservation initiatives, including reducing pesticide usage, planting native and bee-friendly plants, and protecting habitats, can lead to significant improvements in bee populations. In order to test this hypothesis, a detailed research plan should be developed, comprising several controlled studies to scrutinize the impacts of various bee-friendly practices on the bee population. This research could include setting up dedicated bee reserves with reduced or non-usage of pesticides, planting an assortment of native flowering plants that provide sustenance and habitat for bees, and tracking changes in bee populations over a specified period. Furthermore, monitoring the health and reproductive success of the bee populations within these controlled environments, as well as collecting data on the usage of pesticides, planting practices, and habitat restoration initiatives, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these conservation strategies. If the hypothesis is proven correct and the implementation of bee-friendly practices demonstrates significant improvement in bee populations, it can pave the way for large-scale adaptation of these practices, setting a new standard in agriculture and urban planning to foster a healthy and thriving ecosystem that supports bees and other critical pollinators. This would not only ensure the sustainability and growth of global agriculture but also contribute to biodiversity preservation and the resilience of ecosystems worldwide."},{"question":"Given the question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

(Associated Press) In this Wednesday, April 19, 2017 photo, Iraq war veteran Colt Romberger pauses behind an American flag hanging from his trailer in Santa Clarita, Calif. Romberger is training his horse for a ride from California to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington in hopes to raise money for veterans causes and... (Associated Press) SANTA CLARITA, California (AP) — The two things Colt Romberger and his father had most in common, the ones that made them best friends as well as father and son, were a deep affection for horses and an equally deep pride in having served their country in times of war. So when Cliff Romberger, a Vietnam War veteran and onetime wrangler of horses on Hollywood film sets, died in 2015 of a brain disease doctors attributed to his exposure to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange, his son knew there was but one way to honor him: He would saddle up his horse and ride it from the Pacific Ocean to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. On Monday the compact, muscular 32-year-old Iraq war veteran will begin that journey through big-city streets, across desert sand and over mountain ranges and prairies, aboard a handsome gray-and-black 4-year-old quarter horse named Gus. Along the way he hopes to accomplish several things: raise money for veterans causes through a nonprofit foundation he's established, tell the public about the devastating, deadly effect the use of Agent Orange is having on thousands of aging bodies of Vietnam veterans and, with stops at town halls across the country, let those veterans know they have not been forgotten. \\"I've spoken to so many Vietnam vets, and they've emailed me. Sometimes it breaks my heart hearing their stories,\\" he says in a voice momentarily choked with emotion. There was the guy in Norfolk, Virginia, who heard of the ride and sent him 200. When Romberger called to thank him he learned the man was dying of a form of leukemia he believed had been caused by Agent Orange but that had not yet been classified as such because there hadn't been enough cases for the Department of Veterans Affairs to study. He was hoping the government could make that connection in time to add his wife to his survivor's benefits. \\"And then he passed away, and he never got the approval,\\" Romberger says quietly as he sits on the patio of a friend's ranch in a semi-rural section of the picturesque suburb of Santa Clarita, 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Los Angeles. Gus is in a pen nearby, playfully grabbing at a large log he's turned into a toy. They've just finished a lengthy endurance ride through surrounding canyons. Colt Romberger has been preparing for this ride for nearly two years, and like all good cowboys, the reserve Pasadena police officer, Air Force reserve intelligence analyst and part-time actor will bring along a sidekick. It's his late father's best friend. \\"He said, 'Kenny, I'm going to do this. You want to go?' I said, 'You bet,' so I told his mom I'll make sure he's taken care of, and so here we are,\\" said Kenny Reichel, who is putting his business restoring antique cars on hold for the six months the ride is expected to take. Reichel will drive a truck carrying supplies and pulling a horse trailer while scouting for places man and horse might bed down for the night. It will pretty much be Gus who sets the pace, Romberger said, adding when the horse gets tired they'll stop. He estimates they can average 25 miles (40 kilometers) a day. \\"The potential of getting injured on this thing is high,\\" he acknowledges. \\"When you're riding on city streets, a horse can spook and get hit by a truck.\\" To prepare, he's been riding Gus through some of the busy streets of Los Angeles and Pasadena. Recently he dropped by the Pasadena Police Department, which has granted him a leave of duty for the ride. \\"I wish I had taken a picture,\\" Police Chief Phillip Sanchez says with a chuckle. \\"Picture the classic Gary Cooper 'High Noon,' right? He's got this brown Stetson hat on, he's wearing a pair of 501 button-down Levi jeans, a pair of brown boots that have probably seen more cow dung than I want to imagine, and spurs of all things.\\" The department \\"couldn't be more proud of him,\\" Sanchez adds, and will be following his ride on social media. Veterans Affairs has recognized more than a dozen diseases it presumes to be connected with exposure to Agent Orange, the defoliant sprayed on the Vietnam countryside to eliminate ground cover hiding enemy troops. After learning how toxic it was, the U.S. banned its use in 1971. Romberger's father, stationed with the Air Force in Vietnam in 1970 and '71, knew he was exposed but had no idea of the debilitating effects it would cause.

Hormones natural or reproduced by synthesis derivatives thereof used primarily as hormones other steroids used primarily as hormones","response":"Hormones, natural or reproduced by synthesis, derivatives thereof, are used primarily as hormones; other steroids are used primarily as hormones. Step 1: Identify the main ideas. The sentence has two main ideas; hormones are used primarily as hormones, and other steroids are used primarily as hormones. Step 2: Separate the main ideas with a semicolon. This is done by using a semicolon after the first main idea: \\"Hormones, natural or reproduced by synthesis, derivatives thereof, are used primarily as hormones;\\" Step 3: Add commas to clarify ideas within the sentence. In the first main idea, there are two types of hormones mentioned: natural hormones and those reproduced by synthesis. These types of hormones should be separated by a comma after \\"hormones\\". Also, a comma is needed after \\"synthesis\\" to complete the clarification of both types."},{"question":"Q: Turn the given fact into a question by a simple rearrangement of words. This typically involves replacing some part of the given fact with a WH word. For example, replacing the subject of the provided fact with the word \\"what\\" can form a valid question. Don't be creative! You just need to rearrange the words to turn the fact into a question - easy! Don't just randomly remove a word from the given fact to form a question. Remember that your question must evaluate scientific understanding. Pick a word or a phrase in the given fact to be the correct answer, then make the rest of the question. You can also form a question without any WH words. For example, \\"A radio converts electricity into?\\" Fact: Sweating increases the amount of heat that is transferred from the body. A:","response":"The task requires you to create a question from a given fact. In this context, the fact you are given is \\"Sweating increases the amount of heat that is transferred from the body.\\" • The first step is to identify key parts of the sentence that you could potentially turn into a question, for example, the subject (sweating) or the effect (increases the amount of heat that is transferred from the body). • The guidelines say to consider replacing parts of the fact with a 'WH' word. WH words include: who, what, where, when, why, and how. • A rule to consider here is that the question you create should check scientific understanding. Therefore, the question should be based on scientific facts or principles. • The task also allows for the creation of a question without a WH word. Let's apply these steps: One possible way to create a question from this fact is: What increases the amount of heat that is transferred from the body? In this question, the WH word \\"what\\" replaces \\"sweating\\". \\"Sweating\\" then becomes the answer to the question. This question checks for understanding of body temperature regulation, which is a scientific topic. An example without a WH word could be: \\"Sweating increases the amount of heat transferred from the body?\\" Here, the statement is turned into a question by simply adding a question mark at the end, turning the statement into a yes/no question with the answer being \\"yes\\". This also evaluates scientific understanding as someone would need to know how sweating affects body temperature to correctly answer this."},{"question":"Information: - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services.

Songwriter Terry Trindale is attracted to Consuelo Croyden, a woman he sees nightly at a Palm Beach casino. He finally works up the courage to approach her and express his feelings, but she rebuffs his advances. When he later accrues a 3,200 gambling debt to her, Consuelo agrees to hire him as her secretary to work off what he owes her. One of Terry's duties is to assume the role of her fiancé in order to discourage the insistent attention of Tony Barling, to whom Consuelo once was engaged, and to keep her from succumbing to her former beau's charms. Tony refuses to believe she loves someone else, and, when he recognizes Terry from the casino, his suspicions are aroused, despite Terry's outward displays of affection for Consuelo. Tony convinces her to join him on a friend's yacht, but Terry reminds her of his responsibility, and keeps her from going. Four weeks later, Consuelo finds herself still saddled with Terry, who has refused to accompany his songwriting partner Chappie Champagne to New York City to promote their latest tune. Consuelo insists she no longer has any interest in Tony, and offers to cancel the rest of Terry's debt so he can join Chappie. Terry departs, and moments later, Consuelo receives a call from Tony and invites him to the house. Instead, it is Terry, who had disguised his voice, who arrives, and he berates Consuelo for her lack of self-control. Complications arise when Tony actually does arrive on the scene and finds Terry, wearing Consuelo's satin pajamas, in bed.

How to cope with trochanteric bursitis Avoid overuse injuries.

Sentence 2: Do you think I would be a good president? Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze the information provided in both sentences step by step. Sentence 1: 'Do you think I'd make a good leader?' Here, the user is asking for an opinion about their potential to be a good leader. The focus is on the general concept of leadership. Sentence 2: 'Do you think I would be a good president?' In this sentence, the user is asking for an opinion on whether they would be a good president. The focus is on a specific leadership role. Now, let's justify our steps: Step 1: Identify the main subject in both sentences. In both sentences, the main subject is the user ('I'). Step 2: Analyze the context of leadership in both sentences. Sentence 1 discusses leadership in a general sense, while Sentence 2 focuses on a specific leadership role (president). Step 3: Determine whether the context of leadership in the second sentence is included in the context of the first sentence. Being a president is a particular type of leadership role, which falls under the umbrella of general leadership discussed in Sentence 1. Step 4: Justify if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Since being a president is a specific leadership role, and the first sentence asks about being a good leader in general, we can infer that the second sentence can be considered as a more specific aspect of the first sentence. However, it's essential to note that a person could be a good leader in general but might not be suited to be a president. Considering these aspects, we can conclude that the second sentence could be seen as partially entailed by the first sentence. It is implied within the broader scope of leadership, but being a good leader doesn't guarantee suitability for the presidency."},{"question":"Trivia question: What is the least diverse country in the world, with 99.998% of people coming from the same ethnic group?

Problem:Saliva contains the enzymes salivary amylase and lingual lipase that begin the process of breaking down starch and fat. Solution:","response":"In the mouth, saliva, which is secreted by salivary glands, contains enzymes like salivary amylase (ptyalin) and lingual lipase that initiate the digestion of complex carbohydrates and lipids, respectively. The salivary amylase breaks the starch particles down into maltose, a simpler sugar, allowing it to be absorbed further along in the digestive system. Similarly, lingual lipase starts to hydrolyze fats into glycerol and fatty acids, preparing them for more efficient digestion and absorption in the small intestine. These enzymes begin their work as soon as the food enters the mouth, highlighting the important role saliva plays in the process of digestion."},{"question":"By. Rachel Ellis. PUBLISHED:. 08:09 EST, 20 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 19:32 EST, 20 April 2012. A couple who were told it would be ‘virtually impossible’ for them to conceive have had a baby with the help of a pioneering IVF technique – an incubator with built-in CCTV. Gemma and Simon Potter spent four years trying for a child before tests revealed that surgery Mr Potter had as a child had left him with a very low sperm count. The ‘heartbroken’ couple turned to IVF – and a revolutionary device called the Embryoscope, which increases the chances of pregnancy by up to 50 per cent. First in line: Gemma and Simon Potter said the incubator may have helped them conceive on their first IVF cycle. The £100,000 machine, which looks like a microwave, mimics conditions in the womb to provide the perfect controlled environment for fertilisation. The development of the embryos is monitored via CCTV, stopping the laboratory staff from having to remove them from the incubator to check on their progress, which can have a detrimental effect. Mrs Potter, 27, said: ‘When the chance of having a family is ripped away from you, it is the worst thing imaginable. ‘We were heartbroken and felt such a failure. We had got married, bought our first house and now wanted a family.’ Fortunately, the couple’s first cycle of IVF in July, paid for by the NHS, was a success. Their daughter Isabella arrived three weeks ago weighing 6lb 2oz – one of the first babies to be born as a result of the new technique. Mrs Potter, a trainee teacher from Wigan, added: ‘We feel so privileged to be Isabella’s mum and dad. Modern technology: Embryologist Natalie Bowman looks at the time-lapse video created by the Embryoscope. The odds were stacked against us and we really feared it would never happen. 'But amazingly it worked first time and we are sure this new machine helped. She beat the odds and is our little miracle.' Mrs Potter and her husband, 33, a software engineer, had treatment at CARE in Manchester, which is the first fertility clinic in the UK to use the Embryoscope. The machine, which was developed by Danish company Unisense and recently gained approval from the American Food and Drug Administration for clinical use in the U.S., has a built-in microscope and camera system to allow round-the-clock monitoring of the embryos. Embryologist Samantha Duffy with baby Isabella: The Care clinic says the facility has boosted their pregnancy success rate by 44 per cent. Each one can be tracked until it is ready to be put into the mother’s womb, between three and five days after fertilisation. Alison Campbell, head of embryology at CARE, said: 'Currently, assessment of embryos in IVF is limited to brief snapshot glimpses at defined time points, usually one per day involving removal from the incubator. 'With the Embryoscope, images are taken every few minutes and viewed as time-lapse video by the embryologists until the point of embryo transfer without removing them from incubation, usually three or five days later. 'The ability to study these images in a closed system allows us to select the most viable embryo for transfer into the patient, and exclude embryos that are not ideal for implantation.' In Mr and Mrs Potter’s case, only two of the six embryos created were deemed suitable for implantation. Research presented at the Association of Clinical Embryologists conference in Leeds earlier this year showed that the Embryoscope increases the chances of pregnancy by an average of 44 per cent compared with a standard incubator. Write highlights for this article.","response":"This article is about a couple named Gemma and Simon Potter who had a baby through a special IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) technique. They had trouble having a baby because Simon had a low sperm count because of surgery he had as a child. They used a machine called the Embryoscope, which is like a special baby-making incubator with a camera that watches the baby grow before it is put into the mom's womb. This machine helped them have a baby named Isabella. The Embryoscope is a new technology that helps more people have babies through IVF by making it easier for doctors to find the best embryos to use."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? See options at the end Joseph had a new, modern house designed by Robert because OPTIONS: (1). Joseph was a very talented architect. (2). Robert was a very talented architect.","response":"Joseph had a new, modern house designed by Robert because Robert was a very talented architect. In recent years, architectural trends have been gravitating towards modern designs that emphasize minimalist aesthetics, sustainable materials, and innovative techniques. Joseph, realizing the importance of keeping up with these trends, sought the expertise of Robert, a well-known and highly regarded architect within the industry. There are several reasons why Joseph decided to entrust his house design to Robert. As a talented architect, Robert possesses a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise that allows him to create visually stunning yet functional spaces. His extensive portfolio showcases a wide range of projects, from residential homes to commercial buildings, each characterized by their distinct modernist flair. Furthermore, Robert's reputation as an environmentally-conscious architect aligns with Joseph's desire for a sustainable home. By incorporating energy-efficient technologies, such as solar panels and smart insulation, into his designs, Robert ensures that the homes he creates are not only stylish but also environmentally friendly. In addition to his expertise in design and sustainability, Robert also possesses extensive knowledge of building codes and regulations, which enables him to create homes that are not only structurally sound but also compliant with all applicable laws. This ensures that the construction process will be smooth and hassle-free, saving both time and money for his clients. During the design process, Robert closely collaborated with Joseph to develop a house that reflects his unique taste and preferences. By combining modern architectural elements, such as open floor plans and expansive windows, with the client's specific requirements, Robert was able to create a custom home that is both visually stunning and highly functional. In summary, Joseph chose to have his new, modern house designed by Robert because of his exceptional talent and expertise as an architect. With his understanding of contemporary design trends, commitment to sustainability, and thorough knowledge of building codes and regulations, Robert was able to design a house that not only meets Joseph's expectations but also sets a new standard for modern homes in the area. The collaboration between the two individuals resulted in a one-of-a-kind home that perfectly embodies their shared vision of what a contemporary, eco-friendly living space should look like."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Since then , there have been few significant changes , with remarkable changes in the design of the Railcard the most . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"To determine if these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, I will analyze the meaning and structure of each sentence and compare them. 1. Sentence 1: \\"Since then , there have been few significant changes , with frequent changes in the design of the Railcard most recognizable.\\" In this sentence, it is mentioned that there have been few significant changes overall, and among those changes, the most recognizable ones are the frequent changes in the design of the Railcard. 2. Sentence 2: \\"Since then , there have been few significant changes , with remarkable changes in the design of the Railcard the most.\\" This sentence states that there are few significant changes, and among these changes, the remarkable changes in the design of the Railcard are the most notable. Upon comparison, these two sentences convey a similar overall meaning, with both implying that few significant changes have occurred, and the most notable ones involve the design of the Railcard. However, there are slight differences in word choice and emphasis. In summary, although they share a similar message, they are not exact paraphrases of each other due to minor variations in word choice and sentence structure."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Persian.

Available choices: -- Yes; -- No; The answer is:","response":"No; Transpiration is a process that occurs in plants, where water is absorbed by the roots, transported through the plant, and ultimately lost as water vapor through the stomata, which are tiny openings on the leaves. This water vapor is then released into the atmosphere. The term \\"steam\\" used in the description is not entirely accurate, as the correct term should be \\"water vapor.\\" In the question \\"transpiration is when steam moves from _ into the atmosphere,\\" the correct answer should be \\"plants\\" instead of \\"pacific,\\" as transpiration occurs in plants. The Pacific is an ocean and does not represent the process of transpiration. Transpiration is a biological process in plants and has an essential role in the water cycle, contributing to the movement of water from the Earth's surface back to the atmosphere. Transpiration serves several important functions for plants, including: 1. Cooling: As water evaporates through transpiration, it helps to cool the plant, preventing overheating, especially during hot and sunny conditions. 2. Nutrient transport: Transpiration creates a flow of water within the plant, which transports essential nutrients and minerals from the roots to various parts of the plant. 3. Maintaining turgor pressure: The flow of water through transpiration helps to maintain turgor pressure within the plant cells, which in turn, keeps the plant structure rigid and prevents wilting. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question \\"transpiration is when steam moves from _ into the atmosphere\\" should be \\"plants\\" and not \\"pacific,\\" as plants are the primary source of transpiration. This process has significant implications for both the plants themselves and the Earth's water cycle."},{"question":"Translate to French: Web questionnaire validation is carried out in \`real-time', that is as the respondent is completing the questionnaire.","response":"Traduction en français : La validation du questionnaire en ligne est effectuée en \`temps réel\`, c'est-à-dire pendant que le répondant remplit le questionnaire.

I grew up with Ziggy Stardust.\\"Many songs are typically accompanied with specially designed visual aids, including synchronized lighting effects and projected stock-footage montages. Early performances of the song \\"Hurt\\", for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees, a performance of which is featured in the song's music video. Recent performances of the song, however, have featured less lighting effects. Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by Rob Sheridan, while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour. The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery. And All That Could Have Been features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively.

The current Representative from the 19th District is Republican Jodey Arrington. Can we infer the following? People believe Jodey Arrington is a good candidate.","response":"As an AI, I don't have access to current public opinion or sentiment, and the information given doesn't provide any direct insight into whether people believe Jodey Arrington is a good candidate or not. Being elected as a representative could suggest that a significant number of people in the 19th Congressional District of Texas believe he was the best candidate at the time of the election. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that all constituents think he is a good candidate or are satisfied with his performance. The statement in the question deals with subjective public opinion that may change over time and may vary among different demographics within the 19th Congressional District. Public opinion could be influenced by various factors such as the representative's performance, the policies they endorse, how closely they align with constituent interests, their public communication, any prominent events or controversies that occur during their term, and general political climate and partisanship. To accurately assess this, one would need to review consistently updated and reliable sources of public opinion data such as opinion polls, public statements, endorsements, social media sentiment, community engagement, or other mediums where constituents express their approval or disapproval. Furthermore, public opinion can be nuanced, as approving or disapproving of a political candidate doesn't necessarily coincide with believing they are objectively good or bad. For instance, some individuals may believe a candidate is good in the sense of being effective, dedicated, or skilled, yet might disagree with their policy positions. Therefore, opinions on whether a candidate is \\"good\\" can be complex and multi-faceted, making it a challenging aspect to infer without in-depth, current, and precise data."},{"question":"Sentence 1: InFocus M810 is a smartphone marketed by InFocus and manufactured by Foxconn .

Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.

Step 2: Compare the actions in both sentences. Sentence 1 speaks of refraining from an expedient, indicating that Islam hasn't pursued it. Sentence 2, on the other hand, talks about beginning to chase an expedient, suggesting that Islam is pursuing it now. Step 3: Determine the compatibility of the actions. Since the actions suggest opposite directions (avoiding vs. pursuing), the two sentences are contradictory. If the first sentence is true, it means Islam is not pursuing the expedient. In that case, the second sentence cannot be true, as it indicates Islam is now pursuing the same expedient. Conclusion: If the first sentence is true, the second sentence cannot be true, as they describe contradictory actions related to an expedient."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Context: Skylar was nervous about making new friends so she dressed up as a clown.

I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again. When Mary then goes to Uncle Albert's workshop she meets his new young neighbor, who is the exact image of the Nutcracker Prince and asks to be called N.C. The two become close friends, and the last shot of the film shows them ice skating together. contains an answer for the question: Who believes Mary is lying?, what is it ?

Acest lucru se datorează importanței și sensibilității subiectului, precum și posibililor efecte pe termen lung pe care aceste derogări le-ar putea avea asupra politicilor și reglementărilor Uniunii Europene. Prin urmare, este esențial ca Parlamentul European să analizeze cu atenție subiectul și să ia în considerare toate aspectele relevante, astfel încât să se asigure că orice decizie adoptată este în conformitate cu principiile cheie ale Uniunii Europene și nu va afecta negativ integritatea și aplicabilitatea acquis-ului în viitor.

The question centers around the inability to take a motion seriously, as it appears that the opposing party has obstructed efforts to increase transparency into government operations. The user mentions their interest in government documents and witnesses an attempt to pass legislation to help with that. Step 2: Analyze the next sentence The next sentence is: \\"There is only one backbencher.\\" Step 3: Determine the link between sentence and context The next sentence refers to backbenchers, which are members of parliament who do not hold a ministerial or opposition post. The user's primary concern is with government transparency, and desires legislation to aid members in examining the government's operation. Step 4: Evaluate if the sentence follows the preceding text Given the statement's focus on the user's position and concern around transparency, the sentence \\"There is only one backbencher\\" seems unrelated to the points raised earlier.

People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.

The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.

Hermann Balk, the first Livonian Master on your list, would have been responsible for overseeing the order's activities in Livonia, providing guidance and possibly contributing to strategy and decision making. Godert Kettler, on the other hand, came into power much later and would have had the same responsibilities, albeit in a different historical context. It's important to note that each Livonian Master, from Hermann Balk to Godert Kettler, likely faced their own unique challenges and contributed in their own ways to the historical legacy of the Teutonic Order and the larger historical events of the time."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is it when a cell converts from oxygen and carbohydrates into carbon dioxide, water, and energy?\\" is \\"extremely important\\", given that a series of enzyme-mediated reactions is when a cell converts from oxygen and carbohydrates into carbon dioxide, water, and energy? pick from the following.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","response":"There are several potential questions one could ask from this paragraph. Here are a few examples: 1. What major public health initiatives did California pass first that subsequently spread throughout the country? 2. How has California's approach towards health and safety legislation impacted other states? 3. How does California's number of health and safety laws compare to those of other states? 4. What is a \\"nanny state\\" and why do some critics view California as such? 5. How many new laws went into effect in California in January from the year this was written? 6. What are some examples of the new laws that were recently put into effect in California? 7. What is the perception of Californians in terms of their health orientation? 8.

There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness. That was the end of that stunt. Question: How does the group (or some) of boys feel after the shooting episode?

Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.'' A motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family.

It's a typical Quentin Tarantino gambit: taking two genres and mashing them together. In the title role, Jamie Foxx teams up with a bounty hounter.","response":"Title: Django Unchained - Tarantino's Genre-Mashing Masterpiece of 2012 Introduction In 2012, the world of cinema was graced with a film that soon became one of the most talked-about and celebrated films in recent memory - Quentin Tarantino’s \\"Django Unchained.\\" Heralded as one of the best films of the year, it reminded audiences what they loved about cinema: a captivating story, intriguing characters, and of course, the undeniable charisma of a Quentin Tarantino production. Renowned critic Tom Charity asserts that \\"Django Unchained\\" reigns supreme among the best flicks of 2012, and it's easy to see why. The Tarantino Formula: Genre-Mashing A quintessential Tarantino gambit, \\"Django Unchained\\" takes two genres - the spaghetti western and blaxploitation - and expertly weaves them together to deliver an unforgettable cinematic experience. Much like previous works, such as \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" Tarantino continues to showcase his affinity for genre-mashing to create something fresh and unique. In \\"Django Unchained,\\" Tarantino manages to meticulously balance the elements of the spaghetti western - sweeping landscapes, memorable loners, and intense gunplay - with the distinct voice and aesthetics of the gritty blaxploitation genre. The Dynamic Duo: Django and the Bounty Hunter At the core of \\"Django Unchained\\" lies the partnership between the film’s two central characters: the enslaved Django (Jamie Foxx) and the enigmatic bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). The duo teams up as Schultz sets Django free, and together they embark on a thrilling journey through the pre-Civil War South to rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). This unconventional pairing provides the film with the perfect balance of humor, drama, and pathos while showcasing the undeniable chemistry between Foxx and Waltz. Jamie Foxx, in the titular role, delivers a career-defining performance as Django, convincingly embodying the character's evolution from a meek and downtrodden slave to a fearless gunslinger. Foxx masterfully handles both the physical and emotional demands of his role, reminding audiences of his Academy Award-winning acting capabilities. In a performance that won him his second Academy Award, Christoph Waltz shines as the compassionate yet deadly Dr. King Schultz. Waltz brings Tarantino's trademark wit and humor to life in his portrayal, creating a multi-layered character who both challenges and complements Django in their shared pursuit of justice and vengeance. The Supporting Cast: A Lineup of Unforgettable Characters Tarantino's film would be incomplete without a diverse and memorable supporting cast, and \\"Django Unchained\\" does not disappoint in this regard. The menacing plantation owner, Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, provides an intense and chilling villain, while Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of the loyal and treacherous house slave, Stephen, adds another layer of complexity to the story. Conclusion \\"Django Unchained\\" is an exceptional example of Quentin Tarantino's artistry and remains a standout film in his illustrious career. By masterfully combining two genres and enlisting an all-star cast to bring the story to life, Tarantino reaffirms his place at the pinnacle of modern cinema. Those who have seen \\"Django Unchained\\" would agree with critic Tom Charity that the film is not just one of the best flicks of 2012 but holds a position as a captivating and groundbreaking piece of art that will be remembered for years to come."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: architecture, example, tomb What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"Step 1: Analyze the concepts provided. - Architecture is related to the design and planning of buildings. - Example refers to an instance or a specific illustration of something. - Tomb is a structure for the burial or interment of the dead.

Bill used insecticides to get read of aphids, while his buddy farmer Paul didn't. and a hint : Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

A: sad she couldnt get enough balloons to get a bigger reward B: tired from all the popping C: happy she got a reward The answer to this question is:","response":"C: happy she got a reward Justification: In order to determine the best answer according to the given context, we should examine each option and compare it to the information provided. Option A suggests that Sydney would feel sad because she couldn't get enough balloons to get a bigger reward. However, the context only tells us that she got a reward, and does not mention any disappointment or a desire for a larger reward, making this option less likely. Option B suggests that Sydney would feel tired from all the popping. Although it is possible to feel tired from the activity, the context focuses on the fact that she received a reward for popping balloons, which is likely to have a more direct influence on her feelings. Option C states that Sydney would be happy she got a reward. This choice seems to align most closely with the provided context, as Sydney's success in popping balloons resulted in a reward, and receiving a reward generally leads to positive feelings of happiness or satisfaction."},{"question":"What type of thing is the question \\"How many zeros are there in a trillion ?\\" asking about?","response":"The question \\"How many zeros are there in a trillion?\\" is asking about the numerical representation of the term \\"trillion\\".

One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. and a hint : Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. Please answer this question : Would field D have higher or lower potential energy than field C? A:","response":"Field D would have lower potential energy than field C. This is because electric charges, in this case, the negative charges of A and B, move spontaneously from a position of higher potential energy to a position of lower potential energy.

Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests. The ants' removal behavior is important to the... Options: A Because it is easier to manage the living. B Because it can save money to deal with the waste. C Because it can provide more space for the living.

He remains in Iron Maiden, with whom he has released four further studio albums, 2003's Dance of Death, 2006's A Matter of Life and Death, 2010's The Final Frontier and 2015's The Book of Souls. Smith claims that his guitar playing improved after leaving the band in 1990, in particular while working with Roy Z, from whom he \\"learned a lot about picking\\" and became \\"more disciplined.\\" Since returning to Iron Maiden, he has also continued experimenting with tuning (which he began doing in Psycho Motel), stating that he has used drop D tuning in live renditions of \\"Run to the Hills\\", \\"Wrathchild\\", \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\".

In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","response":"The property that can change depending upon the age of a tree when cutting it for wood is the wood's hardness, strength, toughness, and texture. This variation in properties is influenced by the stage of a tree's life when the wood is produced, as well as the distinction between heartwood and sapwood. In some trees, the wood produced in the later stage of their life may have a softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured quality compared to the wood produced earlier in the tree's life. However, in other types of trees, the opposite may be true, where wood produced later in a tree's life is denser, stronger, and tougher than that produced earlier. Another factor to consider is the difference between heartwood and sapwood. In larger trees, the sapwood may be inferior in terms of hardness, strength, and toughness when compared to heartwood from the same log. This occurs because the sapwood is grown during a different time in the tree's life, which affects its quality. Conversely, in smaller trees, the sapwood may actually be superior to the heartwood in terms of these properties. Therefore, the properties of wood can change depending on the age of a tree when it is cut, as well as the specific portion of the tree being used. These changes in properties can significantly influence how the wood may be utilized in various applications, making it essential for woodworkers, builders, and craftsmen to understand and consider these variations when sourcing wood for their projects."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step. \\"People use Meteorology to predict the stock markets.\\" Is the above claim true?

Meteorologists use various tools and techniques to predict and understand weather patterns and atmospheric phenomena. Step 2: Understand Stock Markets Stock markets are a platform where buyers and sellers trade shares of publicly-held companies. Predicting stock market movements involves analyzing factors such as company performance, economic indicators, and investor sentiment. Step 3: Evaluate the Relationship between Meteorology and Stock Markets While weather can impact certain industries, such as agriculture and commodities, meteorology as a whole does not provide direct predictions of stock market trends. Instead, financial analysis and other economic factors play a more significant role in determining the direction of stock markets. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the claim \\"People use Meteorology to predict the stock markets\\" is not true, so the answer is: - no"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: At the New York Bulletin newspaper, its owner, Robert Drexel Gow (Charles Coburn), receives a teletype story that the newspaperâs thirty-nine-year-old editor, Max Wharton (Alexander Knox), is resigning to enlist in the army. Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Maxâs wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (Irene Dunne) (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war (World War II). Robertâs view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper. From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officerâs candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him. After completion of basic training, Max sends Paulie a telegram that officerâs candidate school is in Tetley Field, Florida. She doesnât quite understand Maxâs motivations, but she wants to see her husband succeed in this passion. Paulie arrives at Palmetto Court looking for bungalow 26D and meets the last tenant, Jan Lupton (Jeff Donnell), whose husband Roy has just graduated to second lieutenant. Jan gives Paulie the lowdown on life in 26D, and that life for the enlisted at Tetley Field is all work, work, work. With school, Jan relays a story she heard where once youâre over 21 years of age, your brain doesnât absorb the material taught anymore. Max comes by the bungalow surprised to see his wife there already. They have a loving reunion. The Luptons say goodbye to the Whartons, who can now have a proper reunion. Max and Paulie discuss their upcoming life. Paulie wants to be just like all the other army wives living in the complex.

The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"Castoro Sei\\" belongs to the category of 'mean of transportation'. To provide more detail, \\"Castoro Sei\\" is a pipelaying vessel. It is essentially a type of ship which is significantly utilized within the offshore oil and gas industry. Pipelaying vessels are engineered to assist with the construction of subsea infrastructure. They operate by installing various types of pipelines onto the seabed which serve for the transmission of oil and gas extracted from underwater oil wells to onshore storage and treatment facilities. \\"Castoro Sei,\\" in particular, is a notable vessel in its category. It was built and launched in 1978 and has been used in numerous large-scale offshore developments since then. Commissioned by Saipem, an Italian oil and gas industry contractor, it is a semi-submersible, meaning it can be partially submerged to reduce the vessel's motion in rough seas and increase its stability. With its dynamic positioning, it is capable of installing large diameter pipelines in deep waters. Its name \\"Castoro Sei\\" is Italian for \\"Beaver Six\\". This huge vessel measures 152 meters in length and 70 meters in width, has a gross tonnage of 31,000 tonnes, and can accommodate up to 350 people. It is also equipped with state-of-the-art technology and has an array of facilities onboard. These attributes categorically distinguish \\"Castoro Sei\\" as far more than just an ordinary ship but as a specialized 'mean of transportation' capable of performing complex marine operations in the service of the offshore oil and gas industry."},{"question":"Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \\"Zhejiang model\\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \\"Zhejiang spirit\\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US143.9 billion) respectively.

Answer: When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","response":"Yes, the question has been initially addressed, but a detailed and long answer would involve discussing the specific concerns and ethical principles that hunters believed were violated by internet hunting. Hunters and conservationists argue that internet hunting goes against various ethical and traditional principles associated with hunting. Here are the significant areas in which hunters felt the practice of internet hunting violated these principles: 1. Fair Chase: At the core of hunting ethics lies the principle of fair chase, which emphasizes on giving the hunted wildlife a fair chance to avoid capture or death. Remotely controlled guns used in internet hunting eliminates the need for the hunter to be present physically, which undermines the entire concept of fair chase. Consequently, the animal hunted does not have a reasonable opportunity to escape. 2. Human Connection with Nature: Traditional hunters believe that hunting, apart from being a sport or a source of food, allows them to build a connection with nature. By experiencing the natural environment and the animals they are hunting, they gain an understanding of the importance of conservation and ecological balance. Hunters felt that internet hunting severs this connection by displacing the hunter from the natural habitat. 3. Skill Development: Hunters typically spend years mastering various techniques, tracking, stalking, and understanding the behavior of their prey. Internet hunting effectively eliminates the need for these skills, as an individual can hunt an animal with little prior experience. This deeply conflicts with a hunter's pride and respect for their craft and the long-standing tradition of hunting. 4. Respect for Wildlife: Ethical hunters believe in treating wildlife with respect and ensuring the quick and clean kill of an animal to minimize its suffering. Internet hunting raises concerns about the precision of the remotely controlled guns, which means that prey may not necessarily be killed instantly. As a result, the hunted animal may endure extended suffering, which is unacceptable to many hunters. 5. Conservation: Many hunting organizations actively promote wildlife conservation and educate hunters on responsible methods that help maintain healthy wildlife populations. Internet hunting disregards this aspect by potentially opening the door for excessive killing, as anyone with internet access could hunt from the comfort of their homes, without any quota or restrictions. Overall, hunters felt that internet hunting grossly violated the ethical principles and time-honored traditions associated with their sport, resulting in calls for bans and restrictions on such practices. Many believed that internet hunting threatened the integrity of hunting, conservation efforts, and the bonding experience that hunters have with nature."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: \\"Whitbourne Hall\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Soon, they meet Laura (Melissa Leo) and Stephen (Robert John Burke) who are their neighbors. David is wary of their unusual interest in Emily. He later discovers that the reason for this is that the couple had a daughter who recently died from cancer and looked like Emily. Later, when David visits Laura, she nervously and ambiguously implies that her husband has begun abusing her in response to their child's death, emotionally and perhaps even physically.

Here is a hypothesis: The Hindu faith holds that Delhi is the second oldest city. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To evaluate whether the hypothesis is true based on the given premise, we first need to understand the context of each statement. Premise: \\"Shiva is said to have poured the river down on the plains from the Himalayas; this mythical story leads Hindus to believe that Varanasi is the oldest city in the world.\\" This premise relies on a story from the Hindu faith to conclude that Varanasi is the oldest city in the world. The story explains that Shiva, a prominent deity in Hinduism, released the river Ganges from the Himalayas into the plains, ultimately leading to the creation of Varanasi. This symbolism, according to the premise, leads many Hindus to believe that Varanasi is the oldest city. Hypothesis: \\"The Hindu faith holds that Delhi is the second oldest city.\\" This hypothesis refers to the religious belief that Delhi is the second oldest city in the world, as per the Hindu faith. It's important to note that the hypothesis relies on the same religious context as the premise, indicating a connection between the two statements. To assess the validity of the conclusion that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true, we must carefully examine the connection between these two statements. While both the premise and hypothesis are rooted in the Hindu faith, the premise does not provide any direct evidence that supports the hypothesis. There's no information within the premise that can be logically used to deduce that Delhi is the second oldest city. Furthermore, determining the age of a city based on historical records, archaeological evidence, and urban planning would require empirical evidence beyond the context of religious myths and stories. The age of a city cannot be objectively determined solely based on religious belief, as it represents a subjective understanding that might not necessarily align with historical evidence. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The connection between the two statements is thematic but does not hold enough logical evidence to support the hypothesis based on the premise alone. To verify the hypothesis, one would need to investigate the historical and archaeological records, as well as examine it within the broader context of the Hindu faith, exploring any relevant myths, stories, and beliefs that might provide additional insight into the belief that Delhi is the second oldest city."},{"question":"Question: Question: Who is Cody's CIA handler? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London Context: Agent Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) attends summer camp, actually a secret facility for training CIA teenage agents. When a group of CIA soldiers attempt to abduct head counselor Victor Diaz (Keith Allen), Cody helps him escape, mistaking the CIA operation for a training exercise. The director informs Cody that Diaz stole disks containing plans for a secret mind-control device, and sends Cody to recapture him. In the United Kingdom, Cody poses as a summer orchestra student at the Kenworth estate to spy on owner Lord Duncan Kenworth, suspected of working with Diaz, supported by his handler, Derek (Anthony Anderson) and Kumar, Derek's right-hand man, who are disguised as a chef hired by Lady Josephine Kenworth and a taxi driver respectively. Whilst keeping his mission a secret from his fellow students, Cody sneaks around the estate and confirms that Diaz and Duncan are working together and that they have a working prototype of the mind control device, evidenced when Duncan makes a dog serve drinks and play the piano. The next day, Cody breaks into a lab owned by Duncan, where he sees the finished device: a microchip inserted as a filling into a tooth cavity by dentist Santiago. Shortly afterwards Cody and Derek chase Diaz, armed with a rocket gun, through London streets, but Cody is captured by the Metropolitan Police Service and taken to Scotland Yard. He is later freed by Emily (Hannah Spearritt), a fellow student who, similar to Cody, is actually a British MI6 undercover operative. While Emily buys coffee and soda, henchmen sneak up on Cody, knocking him unconscious by drugging him with spray. They kidnap him and implant him with the microchip. Under Duncan, Santiago and Diaz's influence, Cody meets the CIA director, who is then also converted. This is witnessed by Emily, who explains things to Derek. To get the microchip out of Cody, Derek cuts one of Cody's gadgets, exploding Mentos mints, into a precisely minuscule amount to safely remove it. The group later realise Diaz's plan: to implant all of the world... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London,\\" Cody's CIA handler is Derek, played by Anthony Anderson. Derek plays a significant role in assisting Cody in his undercover mission in London. He disguises himself as a chef hired by Lady Josephine Kenworth in order to maintain his cover while supporting Cody. Cody Banks, portrayed by Frankie Muniz, is a teenager trained as a CIA agent. He is sent to the United Kingdom to spy on Lord Duncan Kenworth under the suspicion that the latter is in cahoots with Victor Diaz, a character the CIA believes stole disks containing plans for a secret mind-control device. Cody poses as a summer orchestra student staying at the Kenworth estate, while secretly investigating Lord Kenworth's potential involvement in the illegal operation. Throughout the film, Derek provides continuous support for Cody's mission, becoming a vital component of the mission’s success. At one point, after Cody is kidnapped and implanted with a mind-control microchip, it is Derek who helps de-program Cody by precisely cutting one of his gadgets - exploding Mentos mints - to a minuscule amount that allows the microchip to be safely removed. So to answer the question, in the context of \\"Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London\\" Cody's CIA handler is indeed Derek. Derek’s role includes providing guidance and support to Cody throughout his undercover mission, thereby playing a pivotal role in the film's plot."},{"question":"–HowtoregisterandstartabusinessinDenmark Please segment the words.","response":"To register and start a business in Denmark, you need to follow several essential steps.

Context: The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) subunits are destabilized via the O(2)-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3). We investigated whether inhibition of PHDs via upregulating HIF might promote postischemic neovascularization.', 'Mice with right femoral artery ligation were treated, by in vivo electrotransfer, with plasmids encoding for an irrelevant short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (shCON [control]) or specific shRNAs directed against HIF-1alpha (shHIF-1alpha), PHD1 (shPHD1), PHD2 (shPHD2), and PHD3 (shPHD3). The silencing of PHDs induced a specific and transient downregulation of their respective mRNA and protein levels at day 2 after ischemia and, as expected, upregulated HIF-1alpha. As a consequence, 2 key hypoxia-inducible proangiogenic actors, vascular endothelial growth factor-A and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, were upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA levels and infiltration of Mac-3-positive macrophages were enhanced in ischemic leg of mice treated with shPHD2 and shPHD3. Furthermore, activation of HIF-1alpha-related pathways was associated with changes in postischemic neovascularization. At day 14, silencing of PHD2 and PHD3 increased vessel density by 2.2- and 2.6-fold, capillary density by 1.8- and 2.1-fold, and foot perfusion by 1.2- and 1.4-fold, respectively, compared with shCON (P<0.001). shPHD1 displayed a lower proangiogenic effect. Of interest, coadministration of shHIF-1alpha with shPHD3 abrogated shPHD3-related effects, suggesting that activation of endogenous HIF-1-dependent pathways mediated the proangiogenic effects of PHD silencing.Question: Does inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins promote therapeutic revascularization? Output:","response":"Task explanation: 1. Understand the task: You need to read the given passage and answer the question based on the context provided. 2. Guidelines: Use the information in the passage to generate an answer. 3. Answering the question: Based on the context, determine if the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins promotes therapeutic revascularization. Steps to find the answer: 1. Read and comprehend the context: In this passage, the authors have investigated whether the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) via upregulating HIF may promote postischemic neovascularization. 2. Look for clues in the results: The passage states that silencing PHD2 and PHD3 proteins led to increased vessel density, capillary density, and foot perfusion. 3. Analyze the findings: The results suggest that the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins, specifically PHD2 and PHD3, appears to have a positive impact on postischemic neovascularization.

She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks. As a train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not.

King George V was represented by Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13 km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.Identity parades were held at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December.

Learn more ||||| When Jeb Bush announced a record fundraising haul in July, the Florida Republican rewarded major donors with a two-day celebratory retreat at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. They also delivered a message: 114 million was just the beginning of how much cash they would need to win. Now, seven months later and just 17 days before the first ballots are cast, Bush’s donors are no longer high-fiving or strategizing how to keep funds flowing. Instead, the money spigot is shutting off as the donor class believes it is just a matter of time before the candidate they threw so much money behind drops out of the race. Story Continued Below POLITICO talked to nearly two dozen major donors, and most say they are waiting for what one veteran Republican and former Bush 43 administration appointee described as the \\"family hall pass\\" to jump to another campaign after the New Hampshire primary. “I’m resigned to it being over, frankly. It’s really disappointing,” said one top Bush Wall Street donor. “I’d urge him to get out after New Hampshire if he doesn’t do well, but he probably won’t.\\" The deterioration of the Bush campaign has been a humbling experience for his fundraisers. A year ago, even before he was a candidate, Bush's team was locking down donors across the country and getting commitments for six- and seven-figure checks with little trouble. Donors were pitted against each other to see who could raise more and be in the good graces of the man who, at the time, was described by many in Bush World as the inevitable nominee. Now the fundraising pitch is decidedly different. \\"Hey, I need you to throw away money on Jeb — out of loyalty,\\" a Bush fundraiser has told donors recently. Rival campaigns are watching Bush's finance operation closely and have been working behind the scenes to lay the groundwork to poach his donor network. So far, a top Florida Republican fundraiser, Brian Ballard, has been one of the only notable defections to Sen. Marco Rubio's camp after Bush's campaign attacked Rubio. \\"Donors I've talked to are desperate not to abandon Jeb because of their long bonds and loyalty with the family, but they are also recognizing there is no ROI [return on investment] on this campaign,\\" said Rick Wilson, a veteran Florida political operative who is backing Rubio. \\"The sense of these folks is it is so sad. They whisper to each other, 'When will Jeb go?'\\" Contingency planning among the donor set is in full force. Much of Bush’s Wall Street support network will shift to Rubio. Even those who still see an outside shot for the former Florida governor expect Rubio to emerge as the establishment alternative to Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. “I think Jeb has the best qualities to be the president, he’s just not doing the world’s best job of getting there,” said a top Wall Street executive who has donated and raised money for Bush. “My attitude is still wait and see what happens. I can’t believe Donald Trump is going to get the nomination. As long as there is still all this insanity there is hope for Jeb.” But once Bush is out, this donor said he was ready to move on to Rubio. “If Jeb were to get out for any reason, most of his support would go to Marco.” But many of Bush’s donors, especially those in finance and on Wall Street, say 2016 simply might be a bad year for a traditional, establishment contender. Rubio and their next preferred player, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, likely don’t have great shots at the nomination either, one donor suggested. “Expectations are not super high [for Bush]. But people are giving him room to try and break out in New Hampshire,” that donor said. “But if it doesn’t happen, pretty much everyone is thinking about the three-way alternative: Trump, Cruz or, gulp, [Hillary] Clinton. There isn't a sense though that Rubio or Christie have got a much better path than Jeb because they are establishment too.” The Bush campaign continues to make the case in conference calls to supporters that the one-time front-runner still has a pathway to the nomination. And several donors praised Bush’s finance operation as one of the best they've ever seen. \\"We are grateful for the support we have and are confident in our plan to win,\\" said Bush spokeswoman Allie Bradenburger in an email. \\"Jeb will continue to campaign hard in states across the nation as our momentum for his message and record of experience continues to grow.\\" Dave Beightol, a Washington-area Bush supporter, said that he was encouraged by reports from bundlers who had been door-knocking in early primary states. \\"Surging may be too strong of a word, but he is moving up quite dramatically,\\" Beightol said. \\"This town is full of regurgitators. You have to go beyond the regurgitators ... Actually, a number of bundler types went door-to-door to get a feel for this and reported on it today. They were very excited about [what they saw] in the field.\\" Still, the pace of Bush fundraisers has also slowed significantly as the candidate has turned his attention to early primary states. On Sunday, Bush was spotted at brunch at the Biltmore in Miami before hitting the golf course at the Coral Gables Country Club.

Here's a question with a factual answer: Question: \\"What is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy for use in cellular processes, and which two byproducts are released during this process?\\" Answer: The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy for use in cellular processes is called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) to produce glucose (C6H12O6), which is a form of chemical energy. The two byproducts released during this process are oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Oxygen is released into the atmosphere and is essential for aerobic respiration in animals, while water is essential for various life processes and maintains the planet's hydrological cycle."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","response":"A diamond cannot float on water. Here's the step-by-step reasoning behind this conclusion: 1. To determine if an object can float, we should consider its density. Density is the mass of an object divided by its volume (Density = Mass/Volume). An object will float if its density is less than the density of the fluid it's placed in. In the case of water, its density is approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). 2. Diamonds are made of carbon and have a crystalline structure. The density of a diamond typically falls between 3.1 to 3.53 g/cm³. This is significantly higher than the density of water. 3. Since the density of a diamond is greater than that of water, the diamond will not be buoyant and will not float on water. Instead, it will sink due to the force of gravity acting upon it. 4. To further illustrate this point, consider the Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. In the case of a diamond, the weight of the water displaced is not enough to counteract the weight of the diamond itself, and as a result, it will not float."},{"question":"Translate to French: When the wrong destination (receiving Customs office) is shown on the freight forwarder's document, the shipment must be re-manifested by either the freight forwarder or the carrier to cover the onward movement.","response":"Étape 1 : Lire et comprendre la phrase en anglais.

WHEN clandestine photos of the redesigned 2012 Volkswagen Beetle turned up on the Internet last fall, two words appeared repeatedly in online critiques: squashed and squished. Producing a sequel to a star car is a formidable task for a designer. But updating already updated cars — retro models like the New Beetle or the Mini Cooper, for example — may be the hardest task of all. It wasn’t just nostalgia that incited harsh words on the blogs. Even recent models have admirers who resist any departure from the original blueprint. When landmark designs like the Audi TT, Chrysler 300 and Mercedes-Benz CLS have been updated, it was often to the dismay of purists. Around the same time that spy photos (and a tease on Oprah Winfrey’s show) were stoking anticipation for the shape of the latest Beetle, I caught the film “Herbie Goes Bananas” on TV. The 1980 sequel to the lovable “Love Bug” of 1968, it is full of bad jokes and ethnic stereotypes — a reminder that good sequels are not easy. For every “Godfather: Part II” or “Empire Strikes Back” there’s an “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.” Automakers are well aware of the risks involved in redesigning a much-admired form. In an interview last year, months before the redesigned Beetle’s unveiling in New York, Klaus Bischoff, director of design for the Volkswagen brand, promised that the company would not ruin the Beetle. The 2012 Beetle would be better, he said. The new version, which Volkswagen calls “the 21st century Beetle,” cold-heartedly chose practicality over personality. “We wanted to give it a whole new character,” Mr. Bischoff said. The car abandons the charming logolike simplicity of the New Beetle, with its three interlocking semicircles. That layout produced a high roof but an awkward allocation of interior space. The new car, Mr. Bischoff said, instead returned to the profile of the classic air-cooled Beetle. The changes were made for a reason. Volkswagen wants to increase sales of the Beetle, whose cute lines had attracted a high proportion of female buyers, by increasing its appeal to men. “We wanted to make a dynamic, sportier, more masculine car,” Mr. Bischoff said last month. Even simple changes in proportion can significantly change a car. The revived Chrysler 300 became a hit in 2004 largely because of the strikingly novel proportion of its greenhouse and body. The high beltline and low roof seemed tough, almost to the point of caricature. But the proportions of the redesigned 300, which went on sale this spring, are much more sober and elegant. It appears more precisely formed, thanks to thin creases in the hood and rear deck. Cars that change public ideas of automobile design radically are hard to update. Often these are “high concept” cars, and improvements made in the name of practicality can fatally damage a design theme. The choice between looks and practicality is one of life’s perennial dilemmas: getting caught in the middle satisfies neither. Changing some cars can damage their heroic status. But for other designs, there may be multiple paths to the essence of the design. For instance, the original Ford Mustang of 1965 is surely a singular design, but “Mustangness” takes many other forms and flavors in subsequent models. These enrich rather than alter the basic gestalt of the car. J Mays, group vice president for design at Ford Motor, calls the Mustang “a franchise,” suggesting a film series like “Harry Potter” or “Star Wars.” For the 2010 redesign of the Mustang, he aimed to channel the spirit of the 1967 fastback models. Mr. Mays referred to seeking “the magnetic center” of Mustang identity. “We decided pretty quickly that we really loved the cars from ’67 to ’70, the one like Steve McQueen had driven in ‘Bullitt,’ ” he said. BMW’s strategy in reviving the Mini was to imagine that the car had remained in production but evolved. This piece of alternative history resulted in a larger vehicle of similar form but different technology. When it came time to redesign the revival, however, the changes were so subtle that only detail-conscious fans would note them. Gert Hildebrand, who was the head of design for the Mini brand after the Mini Cooper was well established, joked that he was lazy and didn’t have to do anything for 40 years. “But then after two months I got bored,” he said. So he produced a bible for designers of the features a Mini should possess: they are to evoke the spirit of the original and its variants. “From the original to the original” is the somewhat Delphic motto of Mini design.","response":"Designing a sequel to a popular car can be a challenging task for automotive designers as they try to balance their signature design with updates and practicality. The process can be especially difficult for redesigned versions of iconic cars like the Volkswagen New Beetle or the Mini Cooper. When these landmark designs are altered, they sometimes face backlash from nostalgic fans. Volkswagen notably aimed to give the 2012 Beetle a more masculine and sporty character to increase its appeal to a broader audience, but some reviewers criticized the design for abandoning some of the beloved characteristics of past models. Designers must weigh the importance of maintaining the essence of the car's identity against changes necessitated by practicality, technology, and evolving consumer preferences. Successful updates to classic designs require careful deliberation and a keen understanding of what makes the original iconic."},{"question":"Q:David Lightfoot worked on a 2005 Australian horror film starring who?

Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single.

Ultimately, Milo Aukerman decided to leave the band once more in order to attend graduate school, further emphasizing his commitment to his education over his musical career. Milo's departure from the band highlights the delicate balance that can exist between artistic passions and other life pursuits. In this case, the lead singer of a successful punk rock band recognized the importance of his education and chose to prioritize it over the band's burgeoning success. This decision not only illustrates the unique challenges faced by musicians, but also underscores the importance of remaining true to one's values and personal goals, even when faced with potential fame and recognition in the world of music."},{"question":"1.

Article:","response":"Title: The Importance of Detecting Relationship Changes Early: 5 Red Flags That May Indicate Trouble Introduction: Strong and healthy marriages are built on mutual trust, respect, open-minded communication, and the willingness to understand and accept one another. However, relationships are dynamic and go through different phases. The connection may change due to factors such as stress, work-related situations, financial struggles and family matters. Paying close attention to your partner's behavior can reveal if there's a shift in the relationship dynamics or if your marriage might be facing some trouble. In this article, we will delve deep into how husbands can identify possible red flags in their marriages, outline five crucial signs to watch out for, and suggest how to address them. Our focus is on creating awareness and encouraging couples to work together to build a stronger relationship and lead a happier life. 1. Increased Complaints and Unresolved Conflicts An early warning sign of potential marital issues is if your wife starts to complain more about you or your relationship. This could be a clear indication that she's unhappy or that some aspects of the marriage are bothering her. It is essential to foster an open and non-defensive discussion in which both parties feel heard and understood. Avoid dismissing her concerns or taking them personally. Instead, consider the possibility that she may be expressing herself to find solutions and better the relationship. 2. Changes in Sexual Desire Intimacy and sexual connection play crucial roles in maintaining a healthy marriage. If your wife's desire for sex has drastically decreased or she appears disinterested, it may suggest that there's an underlying issue that needs attention. It's essential to be gentle and understanding and not see this as a personal rejection. Engage in open communication to determine whether there may be external factors affecting her libido, such as stress, fatigue, or health problems. Work together to rekindle the passion in your relationship. 3. Lack of Emotional Intimacy In any relationship, emotional intimacy sets the foundation for trust, empathy, and a secure connection. If you experience a decrease in emotional intimacy with your wife, such as sharing less about your day or avoiding personal conversations, this might indicate potential marital discord. Instead of dismissing these changes, take the initiative to encourage more open and honest communication. Share your emotions, feelings and concerns regularly, fostering a strong emotional bond. 4. Increased Need for Privacy Another sign that something may be amiss in your relationship is if your wife suddenly desires more privacy. If she spends more time alone or starts closing the door when she is in the room, it may suggest that she’s trying to distance herself from you. Respect her need for space and privacy, but be sure that you both maintain open lines of communication and address any concerns that may arise. 5. Increased Screen Time In the age of technology and social media, spending more time on one's phone is not unusual. However, if your wife is constantly on her phone in your presence, neglecting your conversations or being secretive about her usage, it may be a red flag. Foster healthy boundaries around screen time, ensuring that both of you spend quality time together and engage in productive communication. Conclusion: Marriages are evolving, complex, and dynamic entities, and couples must be aware of the potential red flags in their relationships. Understanding the signs that indicate possible marital discord is crucial for maintaining a strong and healthy connection with your spouse. However, detecting these signs alone isn't enough. The key lies in open communication, empathy, and understanding each other's needs while working together to overcome the challenges."},{"question":"One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime.

The initiative is intended to shave years off an uncertain permitting process that developers say can drag on for the better part of a decade, discouraging potential investors. Mr. Salazar unveiled the initiative during a news conference in Baltimore, where he was joined by other Interior Department representatives and Maryland and Delaware officials. The announcement comes a day after state regulators in Massachusetts approved a plan by National Grid, a regional utility, to buy part of the power to be generated by the Cape Wind offshore wind farm planned for Nantucket Sound. That project has been hampered by legal wrangling, federal reviews and other roadblocks for nearly a decade. The Interior Department finalized a lease with developers of Cape Wind last month. “The Cape Wind lease is an historic milestone in America’s renewable energy future,” Mr. Salazar said in a prepared statement. “But to fully harness the economic and energy benefits of our nation’s vast Atlantic wind potential we need to implement a smart permitting process that is efficient, thorough and unburdened by needless red tape.” The new program, called the “Smart From the Start” wind energy initiative, is modeled after a similar scheme meant to accelerate the adoption of solar power in the West, Mr. Salazar said. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the Interior agency that supplanted the dysfunctional Minerals Management Service after the BP oil spill in the gulf, will work with officials in several Atlantic states — including Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, Rhode Island and Massachusetts — to identify sites for potential development within the next 60 days. Feasibility and environmental assessments of those sites would commence as early as January, according to the Interior’s plan, with an aim of offering leases in areas deemed appropriate by the end of next year or early in 2012. Current regulations governing leases on the Outer Continental Shelf would also be tweaked to allow for more streamlined lease sales in cases where only one qualified developer is involved — although the change would be subject first to a 30-day public comment period. The oceans agency would also work to help fast-track other necessary reviews and permits tied to other agencies, and to aggressively process applications for new transmission infrastructure that would be needed to handle electricity generated by proliferating offshore wind farms. Google and a New York financial firm announced plans last month to invest in a 5 billion transmission backbone for future offshore wind farms. Andrew Sharpless, the chief executive of the environmental organization Oceana, welcomed Mr. Salazar’s announcement. “Ocean wind power is the good witch to the bad witch of ocean oil drilling,” he said in a statement. “We are pleased that the government is welcoming the good witch to our shores. “People need jobs and energy,” he said. “Ocean wind power, unlike ocean oil drilling, is a great way to do both.”","response":"Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has announced an initiative to accelerate the development of offshore wind power projects on the Outer Continental Shelf along the Atlantic coast.

There’s just one problem: the “towers” aren’t necessarily towers at all. The story seems to originate from a Popular Science article last week titled, “Mysterious Phony Cell Towers Could Be Intercepting Your Calls.” It focused on how a fancy device called the CryptoPhone 500 (available for 3,500) can detect when your call has been routed through a “phony” tower. And in fact, the phone recently discovered “17 different phony cell towers known as ‘interceptors.'” The story then spread to an obscure site and beyond. But what the original article never makes clear is that the “interceptors” are not necessarily physical towers, and such devices have been known about for several years. In fact, TheBlaze has been reporting on interceptor devices that mimic towers since 2011, when our own Buck Sexton wrote about something known as a “Stingray” and its legality: The Stingray is a generic term for devices that can track a cellphone’s location as long as it is turned on. As the Journal described its method of operation, the Stingray functions by: “mimicking a cellphone tower, getting a phone to connect to it and measuring signals from the phone. It lets the stingray operator “ping,” or send a signal to, a phone and locate it as long as it is powered on.” Law enforcement across the country does not have a standardized procedure for obtaining permission to use devices like the Stingray, though generally police agencies obtain a court order and not a search warrant, which would require a higher standard of proof. This raises the question: should law enforcement be able to know exactly where you are without going before a judge to show probable cause? TheBlaze TV’s Real News program continued debating the topic in February 2013 and TheBlaze has covered the Stingray numerous other times here, here, here and here. In fact, Elizabeth Kreft conducted a detailed interview this July with a security expert talking about how the Stingray (which is also a brand name in addition to the generic term) and another variation called the Hailstorm work, and why the public should know about them: NF: These devices are pieces of physical equipment that police use themselves to track cellphones. It works by mimicking cell service providers’ cellphone towers and then sending out electronic signals that force phones — really trick phones — into reporting back their identifying information, including their electronic serial numbers and their location. A good way to describe this is that old kids pool game: so the cell site simulator will say “Marco,” and your cellphone says “Polo.” EK: Ha. I want to laugh, but I’m too annoyed. So many ways for innocent Americans to be tracked. Now, some of these are carried and some are permanently fixed, right? NF: One is a handheld model that is a little less powerful, others are vehicle-based that have stronger signals, some of them have directional antennas — but they all work in the same way. But there are several concerning things about how these work, much like cell tower dumps, they trigger every phone in the area — including phones of completely innocent bystanders — into reporting back their location information to the police. This image and its caption sums it up well (don’t let the picture of the actual tower confuse you — look closely): On Thursday’s Glenn Beck Radio Program, the CEO of the company behind the CryptoPhone 500 cleared up some of the confusion: Les Goldsmith of ESD America confirmed the towers aren’t necessarily large physical structures. “That’s the one misconception the media got from this,” Goldsmith said. “When we say a fake cellphone tower, that can be simply a laptop with two dongles plugged into it to actually give it GSM coverage.” “It doesn’t have to be a large fully built tower,” he added. “So you can have somebody in a hotel room with a laptop that is collecting every phone within half a mile and having it run through there instead of a normal cell tower. “Think of it as a cellular repeater. You put a cellular repeater in your building to give you better coverage. All your calls pass through the cellular repeater. Well, an interceptor pretends to be a cell tower and passes your call on like a cellular repeater. It just turns encryption off on the way so it can listen.” Here is the map from Goldsmith and his company showing where the “towers” they located are: But again, they’re not necessarily physical towers. To be fair, the second site to pick up the “17 fake towers” story did eventually add a note at the top of its story admitting the confusion: There have been many comments to this story from people who are assuming that these ‘towers’ are physical installations. There’s no reason to assume this is the case: it’s far likelier that they are mobile installations of the kind used not only by law enforcement and government agencies, but also by scammers and other criminals. But the damage seemed to already be done when the original story took off. Now you have a more complete picture. The use of such technology is still concerning and worth debate, but at least you know that some mysterious construction group isn’t necessarily erecting actual towers in the dead of night and disguising them. Instead, it seems more likely that law enforcement and other government agencies are doing it in a much more covert and frankly easy way with small device and laptop. And that’s probably more scary.

[There have been many comments to this story from people who are assuming that these ‘towers’ are physical installations. There’s no reason to assume this is the case: it’s far likelier that they are mobile installations of the kind used not only by law enforcement and government agencies, but also by scammers and other criminals. (David Harley)] Seventeen mysterious cellphone towers have been found in America which look like ordinary towers, and can only be identified by a heavily customized handset built for Android security – but have a much more malicious purpose, according to Popular Science. The fake ‘towers’ – computers which wirelessly attack cellphones via the “baseband” chips built to allow them to communicate with their networks, can eavesdrop and even install spyware, ESD claims. They are a known technology – but the surprise is that they are in active use. The towers were found by users of the CryptoPhone 500, one of several ultra-secure handsets that have come to market in the last couple of years, after an executive noticed his handset was “leaking” data regularly. Its American manufacturer boasts that the handset has a “hardened” version of Android which removes 468 vulnerabilities from the OS. Android Security: Towers throughout the US Despite its secure OS, Les Goldsmith of the handset’s US manufacturer ESD found that his personal Android security handset’s firewall showed signs of attack “80 to 90” times per hour. The leaks were traced to the mysterious towers. Despite having some of the functions of normal cellphone towers, Goldsmith says their function is rather different. He describes them as “interceptors” and says that various models can eavesdrop and even push spyware to devices. Normal cellphones cannot detect them – only specialized hardware such as ESD’s Android security handsets. Who created the towers and maintains them is unknown, Goldsmith says. Origin of towers ‘unknown’ “Interceptor use in the U.S. is much higher than people had anticipated,” Goldsmith says. “One of our customers took a road trip from Florida to North Carolina and he found eight different interceptors on that trip. We even found one at South Point Casino in Las Vegas.” [Editor’s note: Goldsmith has asked us to stress that the tower was actually in the vicinity of the casino, not within the casino itself.] Their existence can only be seen on specialized devices, such as the custom Android security OS used by Cryptophone, which includes various security features – including “baseband attack detection.” The handset, based on a Samsung Galaxy SIII, is described as offering, a “Hardened Android operating system” offering extra security. “Baseband firewall protects against over-the-air attacks with constant monitoring of baseband processor activity, baseband attack detection, and automated initiation of countermeasures”, claims the site. “What we find suspicious is that a lot of these interceptors are right on top of U.S. military bases.” says Goldsmith. “Whose interceptor is it? Who are they, that’s listening to calls around military bases? The point is: we don’t really know whose they are.” Baseband attacks are considered extremely difficult – the details of the chips are closely guarded. “Interceptors” are costly devices – and hacking baseband chips is thought to be technically advanced beyond the reach of “ordinary” hackers, ESD says. The devices vary in form, and are sold to government agencies and others, but are computers with specialized software designed to defeat the encryption of cellphone networks. The towers target the “Baseband” operating system of cellphones – a secondary OS which sits “between” iOS or Android, for instance, and the cellular network. Goldsmith says that the devices cost “less than 100,000” and does not mention what level or type of device his team has detected. Most are still out of reach of average hackers, although freely advertised. One model is the VME Dominator, which is described as, “a real time GSM A5.1 cell phone interceptor. It cannot be detected. It allows interception of voice and text. It also allows voice manipulation, up or down channel blocking, text intercept and modification, calling & sending text on behalf of the user, and directional finding of a user during random monitoring of calls.” What has come as a surprise is how many “interceptors” are in active use in the U.S., and that their purpose remains mysterious. ||||| If the National Security Agency is capable of accessing and recording people's phone conversations, as it clearly is, then it stands to reason that other groups might have similar abilities. One of the big questions, then, is how, exactly, is it possible to do this? Must hackers break into the systems of mobile phone carriers? Do they need legal access to phone company infrastructure? According to Andrew Rosenblum writing for Popular Science, the answer is actually much more simple: a fake cell phone towers can trick your phone into giving up its secrets, or even open a channel for hackers to plant spyware on your device. Known as interceptors, these devices—little more than a good computer hooked up to a radio—can trick your phone into thinking it's talking to a normal cell phone tower. And according to Rosenblum, they're not all that rare, even in the U.S. In a short trip from Florida to North Carolina researchers working for a company that sells high-security cell phones found eight such interceptors. Nationally, they found at least 17. Some interceptors are limited, only able to passively listen to either outgoing or incoming calls. But full-featured devices like the VME Dominator, available only to government agencies, can not only capture calls and texts, but even actively control the phone, sending out spoof texts, for example. Edward Snowden revealed that the N.S.A. is capable of an over-the-air attack that tells the phone to fake a shut-down while leaving the microphone running, turning the seemingly deactivated phone into a bug. Most cell phones, says Rosenblum, show no signs whatsoever that they've been compromised. According to Rob Waugh for WeLiveSecurity, there's no reason to assume that these interceptors are static cell towers. Instead, he says, “it's far likelier that they are mobile installations of the kind used not only by law enforcement and government agencies, but also by scammers and other criminals.” A basic interceptor can be had for around 1,500, says Wired. ||||| To show what the CryptoPhone can do that less expensive competitors cannot, he points me to a map that he and his customers have created, indicating 17 different phony cell towers known as “interceptors,” detected by the CryptoPhone 500 around the United States during the month of July alone. (The map below is from August.) Interceptors look to a typical phone like an ordinary tower. Once the phone connects with the interceptor, a variety of “over-the-air” attacks become possible, from eavesdropping on calls and texts to pushing spyware to the device. His mobile security team also found that the version of the Android OS that comes standard on the Samsung Galaxy SIII leaks data to parts unknown 80-90 times every hour. That doesn't necessarily mean that the phone has been hacked, Goldmsith says, but the user can't know whether the data is beaming out from a particular app, the OS, or an illicit piece of spyware. His clients want real security and control over their device, and have the money to pay for it. Like many of the ultra-secure phones that have come to market in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks, the CryptoPhone 500, which is marketed in the U.S. by ESD America and built on top of an unassuming Samsung Galaxy SIII body, features high-powered encryption. Les Goldsmith, the CEO of ESD America, says the phone also runs a customized or \\"hardened\\" version of Android that removes 468 vulnerabilities that his engineering team team found in the stock installation of the OS. “What we find suspicious is that a lot of these interceptors are right on top of U.S. military bases. So we begin to wonder – are some of them U.S. government interceptors? Or are some of them Chinese interceptors?” says Goldsmith. “Whose interceptor is it? Who are they, that's listening to calls around military bases? Is it just the U.S. military, or are they foreign governments doing it? The point is: we don't really know whose they are.” Who is running these interceptors and what are they doing with the calls? Goldsmith says we can’t be sure, but he has his suspicions. “Interceptor use in the U.S. is much higher than people had anticipated,” Goldsmith says. “One of our customers took a road trip from Florida to North Carolina and he found 8 different interceptors on that trip. We even found one [in the vicinity of] South Point Casino in Las Vegas.” Interceptors vary widely in expense and sophistication – but in a nutshell, they are radio-equipped computers with software that can use arcane cellular network protocols and defeat the onboard encryption. Whether your phone uses Android or iOS, it also has a second operating system that runs on a part of the phone called a baseband processor. The baseband processor functions as a communications middleman between the phone’s main O.S. and the cell towers. And because chip manufacturers jealously guard details about the baseband O.S., it has been too challenging a target for garden-variety hackers. “The baseband processor is one of the more difficult things to get into or even communicate with,” says Mathew Rowley, a senior security consultant at Matasano Security. “[That’s] because my computer doesn't speak 4G or GSM, and also all those protocols are encrypted. You have to buy special hardware to get in the air and pull down the waves and try to figure out what they mean. It's just pretty unrealistic for the general community.” But for governments or other entities able to afford a price tag of “less than 100,000,” says Goldsmith, high-quality interceptors are quite realistic. Some interceptors are limited, only able to passively listen to either outgoing or incoming calls. But full-featured devices like the VME Dominator, available only to government agencies, can not only capture calls and texts, but even actively control the phone, sending out spoof texts, for example. Edward Snowden revealed that the N.S.A. is capable of an over-the-air attack that tells the phone to fake a shut-down while leaving the microphone running, turning the seemingly deactivated phone into a bug. And various ethical hackers have demonstrated DIY interceptor projects, using a software programmable radio and the open-source base station software package OpenBTS – this creates a basic interceptor for less than 3,000. On August 11, the F.C.C. announced an investigation into the use of interceptors against Americans by foreign intelligence services and criminal gangs. An “Over-the-Air” Attack Feels Like Nothing Whenever he wants to test out his company’s ultra-secure smart phone against an interceptor, Goldsmith drives past a certain government facility in the Nevada desert. (To avoid the attention of the gun-toting counter-intelligence agents in black SUVs who patrol the surrounding roads, he won't identify the facility to Popular Science). He knows that someone at the facility is running an interceptor, which gives him a good way to test out the exotic “baseband firewall” on his phone. Though the baseband OS is a “black box” on other phones, inaccessible to manufacturers and app developers, patent-pending software allows the GSMK CryptoPhone 500 to monitor the baseband processor for suspicious activity. So when Goldsmith and his team drove by the government facility in July, he also took a standard Samsung Galaxy S4 and an iPhone to serve as a control group for his own device. ”As we drove by, the iPhone showed no difference whatsoever. The Samsung Galaxy S4, the call went from 4G to 3G and back to 4G. The CryptoPhone lit up like a Christmas tree.” Though the standard Apple and Android phones showed nothing wrong, the baseband firewall on the Cryptophone set off alerts showing that the phone’s encryption had been turned off, and that the cell tower had no name – a telltale sign of a rogue base station. Standard towers, run by say, Verizon or T-Mobile, will have a name, whereas interceptors often do not. Some devices can not only capture calls and texts, but even actively control the phone and send spoof texts. And the interceptor also forced the CryptoPhone from 4G down to 2G, a much older protocol that is easier to de-crypt in real-time. But the standard smart phones didn’t even show they’d experienced the same attack. “If you've been intercepted, in some cases it might show at the top that you've been forced from 4G down to 2G. But a decent interceptor won't show that,” says Goldsmith. “It'll be set up to show you [falsely] that you're still on 4G. You'll think that you're on 4G, but you're actually being forced back to 2G.” So Do I Need One? Though Goldsmith won’t disclose sales figures or even a retail price for the GSMK CryptoPhone 500, he doesn’t dispute an MIT Technology Review article from this past spring reporting that he produces about 400 phones per week for 3,500 each. So should ordinary Americans skip some car payments to be able to afford to follow suit? It depends on what level of security you expect, and who you might reasonably expect to be trying to listen in, says Oliver Day, who runs Securing Change, an organization that provides security services to non-profits. “There's this thing in our industry called “threat modeling,” says Day. “One of the things you learn is that you have to have a realistic sense of your adversary. Who is my enemy? What skills does he have? What are my goals in terms of security?” If you’re not realistically of interest to the U.S. government and you never leave the country, then the CryptoPhone is probably more protection than you need. Goldsmith says he sells a lot of phones to executives who do business in Asia. The aggressive, sophisticated hacking teams working for the People’s Liberation Army have targeted American trade secrets, as well as political dissidents. Day, who has written a paper about undermining censorship software used by the Chinese government, recommends people in hostile communications environments watch what they say over the phone and buy disposable “burner” phones that can be used briefly and then discarded. “I'm not bringing anything into China that I'm not willing to throw away on my return trip,” says Day. Goldsmith warns that a “burner phone” strategy can be dangerous. If Day were to call another person on the Chinese government’s watch list, his burner phone’s number would be added to the watch list, and then the government would watch to see who else he called. The CryptoPhone 500, in addition to alerting the user whenever it’s under attack, can “hide in plain sight” when making phone calls. Though it does not use standard voice-over-IP or virtual private network security tools, the CryptoPhone can make calls using just a WI-FI connection -- it does not need an identifiable SIM card. When calling over the Internet, the phone appears to eavesdroppers as if it is just browsing the Internet. Update (9/6/2014, 4:10 p.m. ET): Following the publication of this story, Goldsmith claimed that an interceptor was detected near the vicinity of South Point Casino in Las Vegas (he couldn't verify it was on the property). His quote has been edited for clarity. ||||| LAS VEGAS – A security researcher created a cell phone base station that tricks cell phones into routing their outbound calls through his device, allowing someone to intercept even encrypted calls in the clear. The device tricks the phones into disabling encryption and records call details and content before they're routed on their proper way through voice-over-IP. The low-cost, home-brewed device, developed by researcher Chris Paget, mimics more expensive devices already used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies - called IMSI catchers - that can capture phone ID data and content. The devices essentially spoof a legitimate GSM tower and entice cell phones to send them data by emitting a signal that's stronger than legitimate towers in the area. \\"If you have the ability to deliver a reasonably strong signal, then those around are owned,\\" Paget said. Paget's system costs only about 1,500, as opposed to several hundreds of thousands for professional products. Most of the price is for the laptop he used to operate the system. Doing this kind of interception \\"used to be a million dollars, now you can do it with a thousand times less cost,\\" Paget said during a press conference after his attack. \\"If it's 1,500, it's just beyond the range that people can start buying them for themselves and listening in on their neighbors.\\" Paget's device captures only 2G GSM calls, making AT&T and T-Mobile calls, which use GSM, vulnerable to interception. Paget's aim was to highlight vulnerabilities in the GSM standard that allows a rogue station to capture calls. GSM is a second-generation technology that is not as secure as 3G technology. Encrypted calls are not protected from interception because the rogue tower can simply turn it off. Although the GSM specifications say that a phone should pop up a warning when it connects to a station that does not have encryption, SIM cards disable that setting so that alerts are not displayed. \\"Even though the GSM spec requires it, this is a deliberate choice on the cell phone makers,\\" Paget said. The system captures only outbound calls. Inbound calls would go directly to voicemail during the period that someone's phone is connected to Paget's tower. The device could be used by corporate spies, criminals, or private investigators to intercept private calls of targets. \\"Any information that goes across a cell phone you can now intercept,\\" he said, except data. Professional grade IMSI catchers do capture data transfers, but Paget's system doesn't currently do this. His setup included two RF directional antennas about three feet long to amplify his signal in the large conference room, a laptop and open source software. The system emitted only 25 milliwatts, \\"a hundred times less than your average cell phone,\\" he said. Paget received a call from FCC officials on Friday who raised a list of possible regulations his demonstration might violate. To get around legal concerns, he broadcast on a GSM spectrum for HAM radios, 900Mhz, which is the same frequency used by GSM phones and towers in Europe, thus avoiding possible violations of U.S. regulations. Just turning on the antennas caused two dozen phones in the room to connect to Paget's tower. He then set it to spoof an AT&T tower to capture calls from customers of that carrier. \\"As far as your cell phones are concerned, I am now indistinguishable from AT&T,\\" he said. \\"Every AT&T cell phone in the room will gradually start handing over to my network.\\" During the demonstration, only about 30 phones were actually connecting to his tower. Paget says it can take time for phones to find the signal and hand off to the tower, but there are methods for speeding up that process. To address privacy concerns, he set up the system to deliver a recorded message to anyone who tried to make a call from the room while connected to his tower. The message disclosed that their calls were being recorded. All of the data Paget recorded was saved to a USB stick, which he destroyed after the talk. Customers of carriers that use GSM could try to protect their calls from being intercepted in this manner by switching their phones to 3G mode if it's an option. But Paget said he could also capture phones using 3G by sending out jamming noise to block 3G. Phones would then switch to 2G and hook up with his rogue tower. Paget had his jammer and an amplifier on stage but declined to turn them on saying they would \\"probably knock out all Las Vegas cell phone systems.\\" Photo: Dave Bullock ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"The CryptoPhone 500, a high-security phone marketed in the US by ESD America, has exposed 17 fake cell towers across America, also known as interceptors, which can eavesdrop on mobile phone calls and even install spyware onto devices.

Magma cools inside the crust: Magma, which is molten rock located below the Earth's surface, begins to cool and solidify as it loses heat. 2. Magma crystalizes: As the magma cools, it forms mineral crystals, which eventually arrange themselves into a network of interlocking crystals called an intrusive igneous rock. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are granite and diorite. 3. Lava cools on the surface: When magma reaches the Earth's surface through volcanic vents or fissures, it is known as lava. Lava cools down and solidifies as it comes into contact with the cooler atmosphere or surrounding materials. 4. Lava crystalizes: As the lava cools, it also forms mineral crystals which eventually arrange themselves into interlocking crystal networks, creating extrusive igneous rocks or volcanic rocks. Examples of extrusive igneous rocks are basalt and rhyolite. So, after magma crystalizes inside the crust and lava cools on the surface, the final step is the crystallization of the lava resulting in the formation of extrusive igneous rocks."},{"question":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Gary researched two old human settlements. Village A was smaller, it existed about 12,000 years ago. He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed. Which village had higher birth rates? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided about the development of human settlements and the relationship between agriculture, settled life, and birth rates. Step 1: Identify the time period of agriculture invention. According to the given information, agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago. Step 2: Determine the time period of each village. Village A: 12,000 years ago. Village B: 6,000 years ago. Step 3: Compare the time period of each village to the time period of agriculture invention. Village A: Existed 2,000 years before the invention of agriculture. Village B: Existed 4,000 years after the invention of agriculture. Step 4: Analyze the impact of agriculture on birth rates. As mentioned in the information, the invention of agriculture provided a bigger and more dependable food supply, which led to an increase in birth rates. Step 5: Determine which village had higher birth rates based on the impact of agriculture. Village A existed before the invention of agriculture, so it likely had a smaller and less dependable food supply, which would result in lower birth rates. Village B existed after the invention of agriculture, which means it had a bigger and more dependable food supply. Also, the village was much bigger and better developed, reflecting a more settled life. Based on these considerations, Village B likely had higher birth rates."},{"question":"Here is a news article: Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and outgoing Sen. Bob Corker launched into a Twitter spat Sunday morning in a major public falling out, making the Tennessean the latest senior Republican lawmaker to openly criticize Trump over his statements online and off. Trump tweeted Sunday morning in a series of posts attacking Corker that he denied the senator's request for an endorsement -- a claim denied by Corker's chief of staff, Todd Womack, later in the day. \\"The president called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,\\" Womack said in a statement. Trump told Corker he was going to endorse him the day the Tennessee Republican announced his intention to retire, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Corker, whose term expires at the end of next year, made the announcement that he would retire late last month. Trump's slams on Corker come days after the senator made public comments criticizing him. The senator responded to Trump's tweets with an insult later in the morning, calling the White House \\"an adult day care center\\" in a Twitter post. And he wasn't done there. In remarks to The New York Times published on Sunday night, Corker said Trump was treating the presidency like \\"a reality show,\\" making reckless threats against other countries that put the United States \\"on the path to World War III.\\" Corker also said Trump acts \\"like he's doing 'The Apprentice' or something,\\" and that alarmed the senator, according to the Times. \\"He concerns me,\\" Corker told the newspaper. \\"He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.\\" And the risks Trump's behavior presents also concern some of his top officials, who endeavor daily to protect the President from his own instincts, the Times reported. \\"I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him,\\" Corker told the newspaper. The flare-up between the two leaders highlights the long-simmering differences between GOP leaders and the President, who has not shied away from attacking the leadership over their inability to move health care legislation. It also comes as Trump prepares to press Congress to advance his proposed tax overhaul and tensions reportedly grow between Trump and members of his own Cabinet -- especially Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- on issues such as the way to handle North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Corker's vote will be critical on tax reform, and he remains an influential voice on Trump's foreign policy challenges, including over how to handle the Iran nuclear deal. It's not the first time Trump and the White House have privately sent one signal to Corker while publicly saying something else. Following Corker's pointed attack on Trump for his handling of the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, Vice President Mike Pence quietly sought to repair ties with Corker after the President knocked the Tennessee Republican on Twitter, sources said. On Sunday morning, Trump again launched an attack on Corker. \\"Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee.

Ted Lieu expanded on Trump's relationships with members of Congress, saying Corker's response highlighted why Republicans have not been able to pass major legislation this year. \\"Donald Trump is a weak President with low approval ratings who does not command respect on Capitol Hill,\\" Lieu told anchor Ana Cabrera on \\"CNN Newsroom.\\" \\"As a result, Trump can't deliver the votes when he needs it. And to make matters worse, Donald Trump is not trying to build relationships. He lashes out and insults members of Congress.

I could just say this, the President is not respected by many members of Congress. You're seeing that play out in terms of failed legislation, and you see that played out when the President goes after and singles out individual members of Congress and attacks them. That's not how you build relationships.\\" Corker, who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, defended his record on the Iran deal in an op-ed in The Washington Times last year, saying he led Senate opposition to the Obama-era pact and was joined by almost the entire Senate and House in passing legislation in 2015 to establish a process for congressional review. \\"Without it, there would have been no requirement that Congress receive full details of the deal; no review period for Congress to examine and weigh in on the agreement; no requirement that the president regularly certify that Iran is complying; and no way for Congress to rapidly reimpose sanctions should Iran cheat,\\" Corker wrote. The senator has also made some critical comments about Trump's demeanor and temperament in recent weeks. Corker said in August that Trump had not yet demonstrated \\"the stability nor some of the competence\\" he needed to be successful. Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \\"help separate our country from chaos.\\" He said Wednesday that Tillerson,Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \\"help separate our country from chaos.\\" Corker also said Tillerson has not received the support he needs from Trump. \\"I mean, look, I see what's happening here,\\" Corker said. \\"I deal with people throughout the administration and (Tillerson), from my perspective, is in an incredibly frustrating place, where, as I watch, OK, and I can watch very closely on many occasions, I mean you know, he ends up being not being supported in the way I would hope a secretary of state would be supported, that's just from my vantage point.\\" Tillerson, who has reportedly been displeased with Trump and his own role in the administration, made a public statement last week reaffirming his support for the President after news reports spoke of acrimony between the two men -- principally, that Tillerson had questioned Trump's intelligence, calling him a \\"moron,\\" in front of other top officials. Tillerson's statement of support for Trump prompted the President to say his secretary of state had refuted the story about the insult. Trump later told reporters inside a Las Vegas hospital, where he was visiting the victims of last Sunday's mass shooting, that he has \\"total confidence\\" in Tillerson and said reports that the secretary of state called him a moron were \\"fake news\\" and \\"totally made up.\\" ||||| Sen. Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Sunday called the White House “an adult day care center” after President Trump attacked him in a morning Twitter tirade. Setting off an extraordinary squabble between two leaders of the same party, Trump alleged in a trio of tweets that Corker “begged” him for his endorsement, did not receive it and decided to retire because he “didn't have the guts” to run for reelection next year. In response, Corker (Tenn.) tweeted, “It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center.

Corker also sits on the Senate Budget Committee and looks to play a key role in the upcoming debate over taxes. The senator already has expressed some concerns with the Trump administration's proposal on tax cuts. In an apparent response to Corker's \\"adult day care center\\" charge, Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon that Corker was an ineffective senator and could not \\"get the job done.\\" \\"Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it,\\" Trump wrote. \\"We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!\\" Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it.

In a remarkable statement, Corker told reporters that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly “are those people that help separate our country from chaos.” Trump, who has little tolerance for public criticism and prides himself on counterpunching those who cross him, fired off a trio of tweets Sunday morning attacking Corker, who announced last month that he plans to retire and not seek reelection in 2018.

Corker was a prominent supporter of Trump's 2016 campaign, and Trump considered him a potential running mate and secretary of state. Corker was one of only a few senators to develop a personal relationship with Trump and his family, but tensions between the two men flared over the summer. In August, Corker criticized Trump's handling of the deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, saying, “The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.” Then, as now, Corker became a subject of Trump's ire. In response to the senator's “stability” and “competence” comments, Trump tweeted, “Tennessee not happy!” Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18. Tennessee not happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2017 Corker is not the only Republican senator to come under attack from the presidential bully pulpit. In recent months, Trump has gone after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), John McCain (Ariz.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) with cutting and sometimes personal insults. Republican lawmakers have voiced exasperation that Trump is spending his time attacking senators he will need as allies if he hopes to sign any signature legislation, such as the tax-cut plan his administration has been trumpeting. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Sunday that he enjoys working with Corker and that the senator feels free to speak his mind now that he is not seeking reelection. “I think it’s going to be fun to work with him, especially now that he’s announced that he’s not running for reelection, because I think it sort of unleashes him to do whatever and say whatever he wants to say,” Mulvaney said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.” 1 of 81 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Scenes from Trump?s second six months in office View Photos A look at the second half, so far, of the president?s first year in the White House.

Options: - procreate - feel pain - a distress call - reproduce asexually - bite The answer is \\"feel pain\\" because The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"feel pain\\" because pain serves as a significant and vital signal when an animal has received an injury. It is essential to note that pain has evolved as a protective mechanism to alert an individual about potential or actual harm to their body. When an animal is injured, various biological processes and reactions begin, resulting in the perception of pain, which prompts the individual to react and protect itself from further damage. Let's delve further into the reasons and workings behind this evolutionary response. Pain essentially acts as an alarm system for animals, including humans, in response to potentially damaging stimuli. The central and peripheral nervous system components work in tandem to signal the location, intensity, and duration of the pain experienced due to an injury. When an animal gets hurt, specialized nerve cells called nociceptors activate and transmit electrical signals to the spinal cord and, ultimately, the brain. This process results in the perception of pain experienced by the animal. One critical aspect of pain is that it can trigger a wide range of necessary physiological and behavioral responses in the affected animal. These responses can help prevent further damage, facilitate the healing process and in some severe cases, promote the animal's survival. Acute pain, which happens in response to an injury, can initiate reflexive withdrawal and avoidance behaviors. For instance, when an animal touches a hot surface, it will instantaneously retract its limb to avoid sustaining burns. This avoidance behavior also aids in preventing future interactions with similar harmful stimuli. Moreover, pain can cause an animal to become immobile or limit its movement, preventing excessive use of an injured part, thereby facilitating the healing process. Additionally, the pain experienced due to an injury may elicit a distress call. While this option is provided in the question, it holds a complementary rather than an alternative role to pain in signaling an injury. Distress calls serve as an external communication mechanism, allowing the injured animal to seek assistance from other members of their group. These calls can signal the need for help, warn others of danger, or inform group members when to come to their defense. Other options mentioned in the question - procreate, reproduce asexually, and bite - do not directly relate to the signaling of an injury in animals. Procreate and reproduce asexually both refer to different types of reproduction processes, while a bite can be a form of self-defense or predation but is not a categorical indicator of injury. In conclusion, the feeling of pain serves as the primary and most crucial signal when an animal receives an injury. Pain acts as a protective mechanism, initiating physiological and behavioral responses that safeguard the affected animal from further damage, promote healing, and enhance survival rates. Other forms of communication like distress calls can complement this response, but pain remains the most definitive and essential indicator of injury in the animal kingdom."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place.

Options: - very large - pornography - foundation - walls - hole Reasoning process:","response":"To determine the most suitable answer for the given question, let's analyze each option and evaluate its relevance to the construction of a house. 1. Very large: This option refers to the size of a house. While the size of a house is subjective and depends on individual preferences, it isn’t a requirement for building a house. 2. Pornography: This option is completely unrelated to the context of house construction. It can be safely disregarded as an appropriate answer. 3. Foundation: The foundation is a crucial element in the construction of any building, including houses. It supports the structure, provides stability, and ensures the safety of the occupants. A house needs a strong foundation to withstand the loads and forces exerted on it and to prevent structural damage. Therefore, this option seems to be the most logical and appropriate answer. 4. Walls: While walls are an important component of a house, they do not determine where the house can be built. Walls are constructed on an existing foundation and help define the layout and overall structure of the house. 5. Hole: A hole may refer to excavation or the process of clearing the ground before creating a foundation. While it is part of the overall building process, a hole alone is not sufficient for building a house. House construction requires a proper foundation.

Fleming (John Forsythe) while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh (Thomas G. Waites). McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offence, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and has already spent a year and a half in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses McCullaugh's appeal due to its late submission and leaves him in prison. After being released, Arthur takes another case, that of a transgender Ralph Agee (Robert Christian), arrested for small crime and becoming a victim of the legal system. Arthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam (Lee Strasberg) in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer (Christine Lahti). Arthur has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford (Jack Warden), who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while a terrified Arthur begs him to land.

A fire broke out after the tunnel caved in on Sunday, and a number of survivors fled to safety on foot. The usually busy tunnel remains closed, as police are investigating potential negligence. There will be serious questions about how a major tunnel on one of Japan's most important traffic arteries could have failed so catastrophically, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Tokyo reports. The private company that runs the highway has said the tunnel was given a major inspection just two months ago and was given a clean bill of health, our correspondent adds. In pictures: Japan tunnel collapse Emergency workers said that five bodies were recovered from a van early on Monday. They were identified as three men and two women, all in their twenties and from Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported. Another woman, aged 28, who had been in the vehicle survived. Three bodies were found in a car and another body in a lorry. The driver of the lorry had reportedly telephoned for help from inside the 4.3km (2.7 miles) twin-bore tunnel - one of the longest in Japan. Part of the tunnel collapsed at 08:00 local time (23:00 GMT Saturday). Thick black smoke was seen billowing from the tunnel, hampering rescue efforts. Pictures from closed circuit TV cameras inside the tunnel later showed a section of up to 100m (328ft) that had caved in on the Tokyo-bound lanes on the Chuo Expressway in Yamanashi prefecture. A reporter for public broadcaster NHK described driving through the tunnel as it began to collapse, seeing other cars trapped and on fire. His car was badly damaged, he said. Another survivor told the broadcaster that he saw \\"a concrete part of the ceiling fall off all of a sudden when I was driving inside. I saw a fire coming from a crushed car\\". Survivor Tomohiro Suzuki said: \\"A part of the ceiling, just as wide as the road, had collapsed straight down and broken in the middle into a V-shape.\\" He and his family walked for an hour to get out, with the smoke worsening. \\"I heard after a while on the public address system that a fire had occurred inside the tunnel and the sprinkler system was going to be activated,\\" he told Jiji Press. \\"I kept wondering when the fire would spread and catch us,\\" Mr Suzuki said.

The extent of this area can take a number of different interpretations depending on the context, including geographical, cultural, political and economic. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - York Castle in the city of York, England, is a fortified complex comprising, over the last nine centuries, a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings on the south side of the River Foss. The now-ruinous keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford's Tower. Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of York, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be used as a jail and prison until 1929. - In anthropology and geography, a cultural region, cultural sphere, cultural area or culture area refers to a geographical area with one relatively homogeneous human activity or complex of activities (culture). These are often associated with an ethnolinguistic group and the territory it inhabits. Specific cultures often do not limit their geographic coverage to the borders of a nation state, or to smaller subdivisions of a state. Cultural \\"spheres of influence\\" may also overlap or form concentric structures of macrocultures encompassing smaller local cultures. Different boundaries may also be drawn depending on the particular aspect of interest, such as religion and folklore vs. dress and architecture vs. language. - Duke of Northumberland is a noble title that has been created three times in English and British history, twice in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of Great Britain. The current holder of this title is Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland. - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - Joscelin of Louvain, also spelled Jocelin de Louvain and Jocelyn of Leuven, (11211180) was a nobleman from the Duchy of Brabant who settled in England having married an English heiress. Through his youngest son, the House of Percy as the Earls and later the Dukes of Northumberlandbecame the most powerful family in Northern England. He was brother-in-law to King Henry I, whose second wife was Joscelin's half sister Adeliza of Louvain. - The title of Earl of Northumberland was created several times in the Peerage of England and of Great Britain, succeeding the title Earl of Northumbria. Its most famous holders were the House of Percy (\\"alias\\" Perci), who were the most powerful noble family in Northern England for much of the Middle Ages. The heirs of the Percys, via a female line, were ultimately made Duke of Northumberland in 1766. - The House of Neville ( also the House of Nevill ) is a noble house of early medieval origin , which was a leading force in English politics in the later Middle Ages . The family became one of the two major powers in northern England along with the House of Percy and played a central role in the Wars of the Roses . - The Midlands is a cultural and geographic area roughly spanning central England that broadly corresponds to the early medieval Kingdom of Mercia. It borders South East England, South West England, North West England, Yorkshire and Humber, East of England and Wales. Its largest city is Birmingham, and it was an important location for the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. The greater part of the area is formed of two English statistical regions: the West Midlands and East Midlands. - Percy-en-Auge is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. It is the ancestral home of the House of Percy. - The River Trent is the third-longest river in the United Kingdom. Its source is in Staffordshire on the southern edge of Biddulph Moor. It flows through and drains most of the northern Midlands around and east of Birmingham. The river is known for dramatic flooding after storms and spring snowmelt, which in past times often caused the river to change course. - The House of Percy (old French Perci) were the most powerful noble family in northern England for much of the Middle Ages, having descended from William de Percy (d.1096), a Norman who crossed over to England after William the Conqueror in early December 1067, was created 1st feudal baron of Topcliffe in Yorkshire, and was rebuilding York Castle in 1070. The name derives from the manor of Percy-en-Auge in Normandy, the home of the family at the time of the Norman Conquest. Members have held the titles of Earl of Northumberland or Duke of Northumberland to this day, in addition to Baron Percy and other titles. The Percy surname twice died out in the male line but was re-adopted by the husband of a Percy heiress and by their descendants. In the 12th century, the original Percy line was represented by Agnes de Percy, whose son by her husband Joscelin of Louvain adopted the surname Percy. Again in the 18th century, the heiress Elizabeth Seymour married Sir Hugh Smithson, who adopted the surname Percy and was created Duke of Northumberland. - William I (Old Norman: \\"Williame I\\" c. 1028 9 September 1087), usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard, was the first Norman King of England, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as Duke William II) from 1035 onward. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England six years later. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son. - The title Baron Percy has been created several times in the Peerage of England. The first, soon after 1066, a feudal barony rather than a barony by writ, which continued in parallel with the later baronies by writ, until the abolition of feudal tenure by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. The second, created by writ in 1299, became extinct in 1517. The third, created by writ in 1557, became extinct in 1670. The present creation was in 1722, by writ of summons.

Porphyritic rocks may be aphanites or extrusive, with large crystals or phenocrysts floating in a fine-grained groundmass of non-visible crystals, as in a porphyritic basalt, or phanerites or intrusive, with individual crystals of the groundmass easily distinguished with the eye, but one group of crystals clearly much bigger than the rest, as in a porphyritic granite. Most types of igneous rocks may display some degree of porphyritic texture. One main type of rock that has a porphyritic texture are porphyry, though not all porphyritic rocks are porphyries. - Jeffrey Corwin (born July 11, 1967) is an American wildlife biologist and nature conservationist, known as host and executive producer of the Animal Planet cable channel television programs \\"The Jeff Corwin Experience\\" and \\"Corwin's Quest\\". - The bighorn sheep (\\"Ovis canadensis\\") is a species of sheep native to North America named for its large horns. These horns can weigh up to , while the sheep themselves weigh up to .

Sheep originally crossed to North America over the Bering land bridge from Siberia: the population in North America peaked in the millions, and the bighorn sheep entered into the mythology of Native Americans. By 1900, the population had crashed to several thousand, due to diseases introduced through European livestock and overhunting. 'going wild with jeff corwin' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'original network'? Choices: - animal planet - city - disney channel - one - oxygen - prime - q - science - sub A:","response":"'Going Wild with Jeff Corwin' is related to the object entity 'Disney Channel' through the relation of 'original network'."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: You sure is mighty kind to us poor black folk.","response":"As an AI language model I will take the English sentence and translate it into Czech. Translation may differ based on the cultural and idiomatic understanding. Here's the translation: \\"Opravdu jste k nám, chudým černým lidem, velmi laskavý.\\" Step 1: Analyze the sentence. The English sentence \\"You sure is mighty kind to us poor black folk\\" is non-standard English with dialect or derivative language features. The primary subject is 'you'. The object of the sentence 'us poor black folk' refers to a community of people who are described as being poor and of African descent. 'Mighty kind' is an adjective phrase describing the behavior of the subject towards the community. Step 2: Translate words/phrases literally and contextually. While most of the words have a direct translation, some phrases like 'mighty kind' and 'poor black folk' are idiomatic and have to be translated contextually. 'mighty kind' translates to 'velmi laskavý' (meaning 'very kind'). 'Poor black folk' translates to 'chudým černým lidem' which captures the sense of community and the socio-economic status. Step 3: Sentence construction. In Czech, the pronoun usually comes first, followed by the verb and then the rest of the sentence. Hence, the sentence \\"You sure is mighty kind to us poor black folk\\" translates to \\"Opravdu jste k nám, chudým černým lidem, velmi laskavý\\"."},{"question":"Sasha resigned after having very bad personal experiences in Casey's office.

Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition. Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation. In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events. For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition. - Guadalajara is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Jalisco, and the seat of the municipality of Guadalajara.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. According to the above context, answer the following question. What does Donald Trump feel regarding the Stormy Daniels drama? A:","response":"Based on the context provided, it cannot be explicitly determined what Donald Trump feels regarding the Stormy Daniels drama. However, it does mention that the potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, which might imply that the Stormy Daniels drama is an unwelcome distraction for Trump."},{"question":"I'll give you a question, please answer with step-by-step reasoning process. Her voice lent her to the alto section, what group did she join? Options: - symphony - concerto - choir - theater troupe - marching band","response":"Her voice lent her to the alto section, so we need to determine what group that would be associated with. Let's examine the options: 1. Symphony: A symphony is a large-scale orchestral work, typically including various movements or sections. Symphonies generally focus on instrumental music played by orchestras and do not typically involve singers. Therefore, it is unlikely that she joined a symphony. 2. Concerto: A concerto is a musical work featuring a solo instrument, often accompanied by an orchestra. Although a concerto can include vocal parts, the emphasis is usually on the solo instrument. Therefore, this option is also less likely. 3. Choir: A choir is a group of singers who perform together, often singing in different vocal ranges like soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Since the question refers specifically to her joining an \\"alto section,\\" this is a strong indication that she joined a choir, as singers are often divided into sections based on their vocal range in a choir setting. 4. Theater troupe: A theater troupe is a group of actors and performers who work together, typically in theatrical productions, which may include musical theater. However, the mention of \\"alto section\\" does not specifically refer to a theater troupe, as that term is more commonly used in reference to choirs. 5. Marching band: A marching band is a group of musicians, usually including brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments, that perform marching routines. Although some marching bands include singers or color guard performers, the focus is on instrumental music and not specifically on singers or vocal sections. Based on the options provided and the specific mention of the \\"alto section,\\" the group she likely joined was a choir, as choirs are where singers typically join a specific vocal section based on their range (soprano, alto, tenor, or bass)."},{"question":"While highly effective, the requirement for injection limited the use of norepinephrine[clarification needed] and orally active derivatives were sought. A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma. Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects, but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by Smith, Kline and French as a nasal decongestant under the trade name Benzedrine Inhaler. Amphetamine was eventually developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, post-encepheletic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications. It received approval as a New and Nonofficial Remedy from the American Medical Association for these uses in 1937 and remained in common use for depression until the development of tricyclic antidepressants in the 1960s.

Research the Hayward Fault: To determine the type of fault, I need to gather some information about its location, characteristics, and any related geological information. 2. Understand different types of faults: In order to classify the Hayward Fault, I need to understand the characteristics of different types of faults, such as normal, reverse, and strike-slip faults. 3. Compare the Hayward Fault characteristics to different fault types: Once I have a clear understanding of different fault types, I will compare the qualities of the Hayward Fault with them to determine its classification accurately. Step 1: Research the Hayward Fault The Hayward Fault is a significant geological feature located in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, USA. It is considered one of the most dangerous earthquake faults in the United States due to its proximity to urban areas. The fault runs along the east side of the San Francisco Bay, cutting through several cities including Fremont, Hayward, and Oakland. Step 2: Understand different types of faults - Normal faults: These occur when the Earth's crust is pulled apart due to tensional forces, causing one block of rock to drop down relative to the other. - Reverse faults: They are caused by compressional forces, resulting in one block of rock being pushed up over the other. - Strike-slip faults: In this case, the fault blocks move horizontally past each other due to lateral shearing forces. These faults are further classified into left-lateral and right-lateral strike-slip faults. Step 3: Compare the Hayward Fault characteristics to different fault types The Hayward Fault is part of the larger San Andreas Fault System, which is characterized by horizontal motion. This motion is mainly due to the interaction between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates, where the Pacific Plate moves northwest relative to the North American Plate. This characteristic indicates that the Hayward Fault is a strike-slip fault. Conclusion: The Hayward Fault is a strike-slip fault."},{"question":"Write a sentence that about [The Waterman eatType pub; The Waterman food French; The Waterman customer rating 1 out of 5; The Waterman area riverside].","response":"Step 1: Identify the key information from the given input: - The Waterman is a pub - It serves French food - Customer rating is 1 out of 5 - Is located in a riverside area Step 2: Formulate a sentence that incorporates all the key information: The Waterman, a riverside pub specializing in French cuisine, unfortunately receives a low customer rating of 1 out of 5."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Jai and Suhel TV journalists from India in search of the ultimate news scoop: meeting the Taliban.Imran Khan Afridi a soldier of the hated Taliban who needs to escape the wrath of the Afghans and run to his country, Pakistan.

The primitive monarchy is in the home. A young baby cries. The trained nurse turns on the light, lifts the baby, hushes it, sings to it, rocks it, and stills its weeping by caresses and song. When next the baby is put down to sleep, more cries, more soothing and disturbance, and the setting of a tiny instinct which shall some day be will--the power of control. The grandmother arrives on the scene. When baby cries, she plants the little one firmly in its crib, turns down the light, pats and soothes the tiny restless hands that fight the air, watches, waits. From the crib come whimpers, angry cries, yells, sobs, baby snarls and sniffles that die away in a sleepy infant growl. Silence, sleep, repose, and the building of life and nerve and muscle in the quiet and the darkness. The baby has been put in harmony with the laws of nature--the invigoration of fresh air, sleep, stillness--and the little one wakens and grows like a fresh, sweet rose.

The grade was determined by the same criteria as usual, and not by the level of gallantry (and with more junior people instead receiving the British Empire Medal). Oddly, this meant that it was awarded for lesser acts of gallantry than the George Medal, but, as an Order, was worn before it and listed before it in post-nominal initials. From 14 January 1958, these awards were designated the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry. Of what acts did the Members of the Order of the British Empire appoint?","response":"The Members of the Order of the British Empire were appointed for acts of gallantry or bravery that were not in the face of the enemy and were considered below the level required for the George Medal. These acts could include various forms of courageous or valorous deeds in challenging or dangerous situations, demonstrating exceptional dedication, and serving as an inspiration to others. Such acts could have taken place in the realms of public service, community work, scientific or technological advancements, arts, and other significant contributions that positively impacted society or the country. As mentioned in the article, from 14 January 1958, these awards were designated as the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry. Still, it is essential to note that the grade of recognition (Commander, Officer, or Member) was determined by the usual criteria and not solely based on the level of gallantry displayed. More junior people who exhibited acts of gallantry, but did not qualify for the higher levels of the Order, were awarded the British Empire Medal. In summary, Members of the Order of the British Empire were appointed for acts of gallantry and bravery that fell below the threshold required for the George Medal.

They roll up the windows and lock the doors to prevent intrusion. Helplessly trapped inside the troublesome vehicle by a mob that has now closed in around them, the pair forces a clear path through the crowd by brandishing a gun, before making their escape into the street.

Spotting an attractive waitress named Ãngela at a local cafeteria, Pablo is immediately captivated by the receptive (and equally restless) young woman, who soon becomes his lover, promising to stay together always. Pablo teaches Ãngela to shoot a gun and, subsequently, inducts her into their gang after an afternoon of makeshift target shooting. The gang now consists of four members: Pablo, Meca, Ãngela, and Sebastian or \\"Sebas\\". Sebas has joined the group to help in a series of more ambitious thefts, but he is initially unhappy with the presence of a girl in the band. Pablo, with Mecaâs support, assures him that Ãngela can hold her own.

By doing this, you are showing that you do want his friends to be part of your life. Be honest. Your boyfriend will value this because it shows that you are willing to be up front about how you feel. You might start the discussion with a phrase like, “I don’t seem to be fitting in with your friends.” Or, perhaps, you can say “I want to know more about your friends.” Using gentle language like this will make it easy to start conversing. You may think that you are getting bad signals from your boyfriend’s friends. Yet, if you think about this from their side, you might possibly find that they are not reacting badly towards you out of malice. For example, they may just be protective of their friend. They don’t necessarily dislike you, but they feel they need to put up a strong front in order to keep you from hurting their friend. If you explain to them that you aren’t, then you might find they will be more receptive to you, and less likely to irritate you on purpose. This is hard but doable. By thinking about their perspectives, you will be able to find a way to communicate with them. It’s natural to want to be with your partner when you first meet. It is also completely natural to become envious of anyone who also has claims on his time. However, you should not lash out at him or his friends because you feel this way. Take this as a good sign. It means that you have found a person that everyone wants to spend time with. For example, you might become jealous of his best friend. Though this is a natural reaction, you shouldn’t become too possessive of your boyfriend. He and his best friend have probably known each other for a while, so you should respect that they need to have their time together. You may not understand why his friends behave in a certain way. They may act in ways that annoy and irritate you. You might try ignoring them. However, sometimes, this may be impossible to do. In that case, you need to find a way to confront them in a non-threatening manner. For example, perhaps one of his friends always tags along with you and your boyfriend. You don’t know why this is. Perhaps, he simply does not have much to do or he just really likes your boyfriend. Either way, this is getting on your nerves. The next time he wants to hang out with you both, ask your boyfriend to tell him that you want to have couple time. If your boyfriend tells him this, then he will probably get the message.

A 'prime number' is a a whole number above 1 that can not be made by multiplying other whole numbers. 41616","response":"To determine if the given number 41616 is a prime number, we can follow these steps: 1. Check whether the number is greater than 1. Prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1. In this case, 41616 is greater than 1, so we can proceed to the next step. 2. Find the factors of the number. Factors are whole numbers that can be multiplied together to equal the original number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. 3. We can start by checking if the number is divisible by any whole number between 2 and (41616 / 2). If we find any factors, then the number is not prime. 4. When checking, we find that 41616 can be divided by 2 (2 * 20808 = 41616). This means that 41616 is not a prime number, as it has factors other than 1 and itself. Based on these steps, we can determine that 41616 is not a prime number, so the answer is \\"No.\\" Explanation: In order to find out if 41616 is a prime number, I used the definition of a prime number as a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers together.

Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins. Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might.

Singer Beck's father worked on what album what was the 2nd studio album by Linkin Park? Answer:","response":"Singer Beck's father, David Campbell, is a Canadian musician, composer, and arranger who has been active in the music industry since the 1970s. He has worked on numerous high-profile albums as a string arranger and conductor, contributing his talents to an impressive roster of artists. One of his notable collaborations is with the American rock band, Linkin Park. Linkin Park's second studio album, titled “Meteora,” was released on March 25, 2003, by Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Don Gilmore and co-produced by the band, Meteora was a follow-up to their highly successful debut album, “Hybrid Theory.” The album was a significant commercial success and solidified Linkin Park's status as one of the leading acts in the early 2000s nu-metal and alternative rock scenes. Meteora features a fusion of alternative metal, rap, and electronic sounds, and it includes popular singles such as \\"Somewhere I Belong,\\" \\"Faint,\\" \\"Numb,\\" \\"From the Inside,\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit.\\" David Campbell contributed to Meteora as a string arranger, specifically on the song \\"Breaking the Habit.\\" The song is a standout track on the album, featuring Campbell's evocative string arrangement combined with the band's signature rap-rock fusion.

These two statements are unrelated, as one refers to the presence of various museums within a city, while the other is asking for a definition or description of \\"bombillas.\\" To properly answer the question about bombillas, we need to provide information about what they are and their use or significance. Bombillas are metal, wood, or bamboo straws with a filtered end used primarily for drinking the traditional South American beverage called mate. Mate is an infusion of the yerba mate plant, which is prepared by steeping dried yerba mate leaves in hot water. The bombilla serves as both a straw and a sieve, allowing the person consuming the mate to enjoy the liquid without consuming the leaves or other plant debris. Originating from the indigenous Guarani people in the regions that now comprise Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil, the mate and bombilla have become symbols of cultural and social tradition. The communal consumption of mate fosters a sense of belonging and connectedness among participants, as they pass the shared gourd from one person to another in a clockwise manner. Bombillas can vary in size, material, and design, with the most common being made of metal (usually stainless steel or silver) due to their durability. Some bombillas may even boast intricate designs or patterns that add an artistic flair to the otherwise utilitarian item. The practical design of the bombilla has also led to its use in consuming other thick or pulpy beverages, such as fruit juices or smoothies, ensuring that solid particles are separated while sipping. In summary, the sentence about museums does not provide any information about bombillas. To answer the question about bombillas, it is essential to discuss their purpose, usage, cultural significance, and regional history. These drinking straws, employed predominantly for consuming mate, serve both practical and symbolic roles within South American culture, transcending their simple, utilitarian function."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

In nearby neighborhood in Kirkuk, gunmen shoot father and three sons; one dies. Targeted by extremists, many of Iraq's 1 million Christians have fled country.","response":"Title: The Unspoken Plight of Iraq's Christian Community: Violence and Exodus Introduction In recent years, the minority Christian population of Iraq has been subjected to increased violence, resulting in many Christians fleeing their homeland for safety. The extent of this religious persecution has left a deep impact on the once-thriving community, and the incidents that unfolded late Sunday in Kirkuk, Iraq, are tragic reminders of the constant fear and danger faced by these individuals and their families. Brutal Attack on a Christian Family in Kirkuk Late Sunday night, a Christian woman and her daughter-in-law became the latest victims of targeted violence against the Christian community in Iraq, as unidentified assailants brutally slit their throats within the confines of their home. Reports suggest that the incident occurred without warning, leaving the family little chance to defend themselves or seek help from neighbors. In a separate incident, also on Sunday, in a nearby neighborhood in Kirkuk, a father and his three sons were ruthlessly shot by gunmen. One of the sons succumbed to his injuries, marking yet another tragic loss within the Christian community. Although the police have launched an investigation, the perpetrators of these violent attacks remain at large, fueling suspicion that they may be part of an organized group targeting Christians. The Exodus of Iraqi Christians The violence against the Christian community in Iraq is not a new phenomenon, but the frequency and intensity of these attacks have significantly increased in recent years. Out of an estimated 1.4 million Christians residing in the country before the US-led invasion in 2003, approximately 1 million have fled their homes in search of safety and a better life elsewhere. The mass exodus is a result of the constant threat of violent attacks, kidnappings, and killings at the hands of extremists who view the minority Christian community as a convenient target. Iraq's dwindling Christian population has profound implications for both the heritage and the future of the country. As one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, Iraqi Christians have contributed significantly to the nation's history, culture, and social fabric. However, the constant fear, displacement, and uncertainty that have befallen this minority community have left irrevocable damage, as ancestral homes are abandoned, and centuries-old customs and traditions are threatened with extinction. The International Community's Response Despite the alarming situation faced by the Christian community in Iraq, the international community's response has been largely muted. Governments, human rights organizations, and religious leaders worldwide must come together to actively condemn and combat religious persecution of any kind and recognize the struggles faced by Iraq's Christians. Providing financial assistance, political support, and increasing awareness of the plight of these communities are just a few ways in which the global community can ensure significant change and improvement in their lives. Conclusion The tragic events that unfolded in Kirkuk serve as a stark reminder of the continuing challenges faced by Iraq's Christian community. With extremists increasingly targeting the minority group, it is crucial for the government, security agencies, and the global community to address the issue and ensure that these vulnerable individuals are protected from the forces that seek to harm them. It is time for the international community to break its silence on the persecution of Iraqi Christians, take a stand, and work together to bring about meaningful change, both within and outside of Iraq's borders."},{"question":"Generate short a sentence that can be linguistically classified as a).

To be effective, the blow dryer must be used repeatedly (every 1 to 7 days since eggs hatch in 7 to 10 days) until the natural life cycle of the lice is over (about 4 weeks). Can we conclude that does blow drying your hair get rid of lice?","response":"While using a standard home blow dryer may significantly reduce the number of lice eggs in the hair, it is not a guaranteed method for entirely getting rid of lice. To determine if blow drying your hair can fully eliminate lice, we need to consider several factors such as technique, frequency, the lice life cycle, and other complementary treatments. Blow drying can potentially destroy eggs and kill live lice due to the heat generated by the dryer. However, several aspects need to be considered for the effectiveness of this method: 1. Technique: Proper technique involves using the blow dryer on low heat and focusing on one hair section at a time. The dryer should be kept at a safe distance from the scalp to avoid scalp burns. It is essential to pay attention to each hair section and avoid missing any areas where eggs or lice may be present. However, relying solely on manual techniques may leave room for human error, which could result in some eggs or lice remaining in the hair. 2. Frequency: Regular blow drying is crucial for effective treatment. Since lice eggs hatch in 7 to 10 days, it is recommended to blow dry the hair every 1 to 7 days, over a period of approximately 4 weeks. This frequency helps ensure that any unhatched eggs or newly hatched lice are exposed to the heat treatment. It is important to maintain this regimen strictly, as missing a day or two could lead to persistent lice outbreaks. 3. Lice life cycle: As mentioned earlier, the lice life cycle is about 4 weeks long. However, the presence of heat-resistant eggs, or a recurring infestation from external factors such as shared clothing or personal items, may prolong the life cycle and require a longer period of treatment and diligent follow-ups. 4. Complementary treatments: To increase the efficacy of the blow dry method, it is recommended to use it in conjunction with other treatment options such as over-the-counter lice shampoos, wet combing, and prescription medications. The use of these treatments, alongside regular blow drying, can increase the likelihood of fully getting rid of lice. In conclusion, while blow drying your hair can potentially reduce the number of lice eggs and live lice, it should not be relied upon as the sole method for lice eradication. Proper technique, frequency, consideration of the lice life cycle, and the use of additional treatments are necessary for effectively getting rid of lice. It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for guidance on the most suitable course of action for treating lice infestation."},{"question":"Article: Do you routinely prepare for trash day, sweep up when necessary, and pitch in toward a functional house? Many of these tasks may be considered part of your chores or expectations, but extra effort may be rewarded. Most parents like to see their kids attempting to be responsible with money, so ask them for a weekly or monthly allowance. Negotiate a fair amount of money for the work that you do. Don't expect them to pay you /£20 for nothing. They may expect you to complete a few more household chores since they are paying you regularly. Think about how you will justify this allowance. Why do you need it? Why do you deserve it? Be prepared to give your parents good reasons if asked. Common tasks that parents pay their children allowance to complete include: cleaning your room, emptying and loading the dishwasher, vacuuming, washing and folding laundry, and dusting. Look for opportunities for some extra cash in less common tasks. Think of any \\"someday\\" projects your parents have been talking about. Does Mom keep saying she needs to organize her tools in the garage? Does she always talk about reorganizing the pantry? Does Dad want his shop organized? Great! Come up with a plan to complete those tasks and present it to your parents along with your asking price. Present a reasonable plan with a realistic price and, after a little follow-through, you've got a payday. If you are trying to make money from your parents, don't hurt your chances by acting up. Arguing with your siblings, talking back to your parents, and breaking the rules may result in them taking away your allowance or punishing you by requiring you to do the work for no money. If your parents give you money for drinks, snacks, or sweets when you go to school or out with your friends, spend that money smartly. Instead of using all of it, maybe limit yourself to a can of coke or lemonade and put your other money away for later. That way you can still enjoy yourself, but save a little for later. If your parents send you into a store to pick up a few items, ask them if you can have the change. If they expect the money back, ask them can you keep the coins. Pennies, pounds and other coins quickly add up. If you've already got a savings account, talk to your parents about moving your money into an account which gains interest - that is, one that grows your money.

Interest rate. The rate of your simple interest payment plan will most likely be communicated with a number in percentage form. This percentage reflects the amount of money extra you will be paying given a certain amount of time. Usually the rate is annual - for example if your rate is 15%, the extra amount will be 15% of the principal for every year that you have an outstanding balance. Principal amount. This amount reflects your outstanding balance. For instance, if you bought a computer that costs 2,000 and paid 1000 upfront, you would then have a principal amount of 1,000 left to pay. Time period of payment plan. This is the amount of time between your first and last payment. The longer the period is, the higher the total amount you paid for your purchase will be. . You need to find out much extra is going to be added to your outstanding balance. Identify your your variables. What is the rate, the principal and time period of your payment plan? Be sure to convert your rate into a decimal amount. To do this you need to divide the number in the percentage by 100. For example, if your rate is 15%, divide 15 by 100 - you will get .15, the rate in decimal form. Consider the period of your payment plan versus the period specified by your interest rate. Does the period of your payment plan fit evenly into the period specified by the rate? If not, you will need to divide your interest rate before you do any further calculation with it. Imagine the case where you will only be making payments for 7 months but the rate is given per annum. You will probably need to divide the annual interest rate by 12 in order to generate a monthly interest rate. Multiply your rate in decimal form by the principal (rate x principal). This tells you how much interest will accrue per period. For example, if the principal is 1000 and the annual interest rate is 15% (.15), then you will be paying 150 per year in interest. If the principal is 1000 and your monthly rate is 3% (.03), then you will have to paying 30 per month in interest. Multiply the amount of interest per period by the number of time periods you expect it will take you to complete your payment (interest accrued per period x periods). This will give you your total accrued interest. Say you know that you'll be paying 150 per year in interest and you will be paying off your purchase for 3 years – by multiplying these numbers (150 x 3) you would find that your total accrued interest is 450. Add your total accrued interest to your principal amount (interest + principle). If you found that your total accrued interest is 450 and the corresponding principal amount is 1000, by adding these two figures you'll find that the total cost of your purchase is 1450. Consider how often you will be making your payment compared with the period in which you are accruing interest.

For handsome men,the extra kicks are more likely to come from economic benefits,like increased wages, while women are more likely to find joy just looking in the mirror. \\"Women feel that beauty is naturally important,\\" says Daniel Hamermesh,a University of Texas at Austin labor economist and the study's lead author. \\"They just feel bad if they're ugly.\\" Hamermesh is the acknowledged father of pulchronomics, or the economic study of beauty.

The pursuit of good looks drives several huge industries--in 2010, Americans spent 845 million on face-lifts alone--but few economists focused on beauty's financial power until the mid-1990s,when Hamermesh and his colleague, Jeff Biddle of Michigan State University, became the first scholars to track the effect of appearance on earnings potential for a large sample of adults.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When observing people's behavior and facial expressions, one might wonder if it is feasible to accurately predict their thoughts. To answer this, let's consider the complexities of human thought processes, psychology, and individual differences. First, human thought processes are multifaceted and not limited to observable actions or facial expressions. They encompass emotions, memories, and cognitive processes, which often occur internally and cannot be directly witnessed. Besides, people have varying degrees of emotional intelligence and the capacity for introspection, which make it challenging to determine their thoughts' true nature. Secondly, psychological studies suggest that people's thoughts and emotions can be influenced by numerous factors, including environmental stimuli, past experiences, and socio-cultural contexts. These aspects shape the way people perceive, process, and interpret different situations, which can significantly impact their thoughts and emotions. Since these variables are often dynamic and diverse, identifying an individual's thought process accurately based on their behavior and facial expressions becomes extremely difficult. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the unique differences among individuals, including their personalities, emotional regulation, and coping mechanisms. These factors determine how people may react or express themselves in different situations. For instance, two individuals experiencing the same emotion could manifest entirely different facial expressions or behaviors depending on their personality and emotional regulation abilities. In conclusion, given the intricate nature of human thought processes, psychological influences, and individual differences, it is not possible to tell someone's thoughts accurately just by observing their behavior and facial expressions. Human thoughts are complex and go beyond what can be perceived externally."},{"question":"Increasingly interested in a career in politics, Castro had become a candidate for a seat in the Cuban parliament when General Fulgencio Batista led a coup d'état in 1952, successfully overthrowing the government of President Carlos Prío Socarrás and canceling the election.

Options: - neuronal network - memories - intelligence - recall - learning about Let's think step by step:","response":"The ability to remember things is a sign of multiple factors such as neuronal networks, memories, intelligence, recall, and learning. Let's break down each option to understand this better. 1. Neuronal network: A neuronal network, also known as a neural network, refers to the interconnected web of neurons in our brain that play a significant role in processing and transmitting information. The ability to remember things is a sign of a healthy and well-developed neuronal network, as it allows for the storage and retrieval of memories. 2. Memories: Memories are the mental representations of past experiences, knowledge, events, and facts. The ability to remember things is a direct sign of having memories, as they provide the content for our recollections. 3. Intelligence: Intelligence is the capacity to learn, reason, and adapt to new situations. While it is not synonymous with memory, the ability to remember things can be seen as a sign of intelligence, as it aids in problem-solving and the application of previously acquired knowledge to new situations. 4. Recall: Recall refers to the process of retrieving information from our memories. The ability to remember things is a sign of good recall, as it reflects our capability to access specific pieces of information when needed. 5. Learning: Learning is the process of acquiring new knowledge, skills, and behaviors as a result of experience. The ability to remember things is a sign of learning because it is an essential part of the learning process – only if we remember and retain information can we apply it, build upon it, and use it in future applications. In summary, the ability to remember things is a sign of a well-functioning neuronal network, the presence of memories, intelligence, good recall, and effective learning. Each of these components contributes to our memory capacity, making them all important factors in understanding the ability to remember."},{"question":"Q: when is season 4 of orange is the new black coming out?

In a conference call Sunday afternoon, the 49ers’ head coach said he had just left a meeting in which the makeup of the offensive line was discussed. That unit was a glaring concern in the 49ers’ third preseason game Saturday in Denver. “We’re in the middle of that now,” Tomsula said, declining to comment on specifics because the players were off until Monday. On defense, linebacker NaVorro Bowman’s performance was cause for great optimism, but the team will be without Ahmad Brooks for the foreseeable future. Brooks, who is facing misdemeanor sexual-battery charges, was sent home from Colorado last week and will not practice with the team. “That’s day-to-day,” Tomsula said. “I have not been updated on that at all, so it’s exactly where it is.” Rookie Eli Harold started in Brooks’ place at outside linebacker, on the right side. Cory Lemonier started on the left side. Aaron Lynch did not play until the second half. “There’s a lot of competition going on there,” Tomsula said. “We did want to see them on the field together, against the best the opponent had out there.” Tomsula addressed the concerns of an entire continent, explaining that he thinks he knows what Jarryd Hayne can do returning punts. Hayne did not play in the first half Saturday. “I’m pretty confident in Jarryd’s ability to field the ball,” Tomsula said. “I’ve watched a ton of tape on this guy fielding a rugby ball. I’ve seen him field here at practice, in game situations. I feel very good about his abilities to perform with the ball in his hands on special teams. “The tackling part of it, the coverage part, I’ve seen a lot of improvement. I’ve seen what I need to see. It’s been a great evaluation.” Tomsula wanted to see the others who are in the return mix: Reggie Bush, Bruce Ellington and undrafted rookie DeAndrew White. Between now and Saturday, the final cutdown date, Tomsula has several decisions to make. The biggest involve the offensive line. There is no time frame for the return of Daniel Kilgore — “That’s going to be day-to-day,” Tomsula said — who started seven games at center last season before breaking his fibula. He is still recovering. The right side of the line is a question mark, and Colin Kaepernick faced constant pressure Saturday night. Tomsula indicated that Kaepernick had other options on the play on which he was sacked for a safety, but that the team is concerned about putting too much on video for regular-season opponents. Tomsula wouldn’t use fatigue or altitude as an excuse for the sloppiness of the game. The 49ers committed 13 penalties. “We don’t have any excuses,” he said. “We just have to fix it.” Ann Killion is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

What classifications does India fit in order for it to be called a subcontinent? Is India considered a subcontinent?","response":"These questions are related but they do not have the same meaning. To make it clearer, I will break down each question and provide a detailed answer. Question 1: \\"What classifications does India fit in order for it to be called a subcontinent?\\" This question aims to understand the specific criteria or characteristics that qualify India as a subcontinent. In this context, the key classifications and criteria are: 1. Geological: India was originally a separate landmass that eventually collided with Eurasia, forming the Himalayas. The Indian tectonic plate is still pushing northward against the Eurasian plate, causing this mountain range to rise in elevation every year. This geological distinction is a significant factor in categorizing India as a subcontinent. 2. Size: A subcontinent is typically a large, distinct part of a continent that stands out and has unique geographical features. India covers an area of more than 3 million square kilometers (1.2 million square miles), making it the seventh-largest country in the world by land area. The sheer size of India is a considerable factor in labeling it a subcontinent. 3. Geographic features: A subcontinent generally has distinct topographical features that set it apart from the rest of the continent. In the case of India, the towering Himalayan Mountains in the north, the Thar Desert to the northwest, the Deccan Plateau, and the Eastern and Western Ghats form specific geographical boundaries, distinguishing it from the rest of Asia. 4. Biodiversity: India hosts a wide range of ecosystems and biodiversity due to its varied geography and climate. From the Himalayan Mountains to the rich mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, these unique ecosystems further emphasize India's status as a subcontinent. 5. Cultural and linguistic diversity: A subcontinent often encompasses a well-defined cultural, political, and ethnic identity. With over 1.3 billion people and over 2,000 distinct ethnic groups, India has its cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity. This cultural uniqueness contributes to why it's classified as a subcontinent. Question 2: \\"Is India considered a subcontinent?\\" This question is more direct and asks whether India is recognized as a subcontinent or not. The answer is yes. Based on the various criteria and classifications explained above (geology, size, geographical features, biodiversity, and cultural diversity), India can be, and is, considered a subcontinent of the larger Asian continent. The term \\"Indian subcontinent\\" is widely used to encompass not just India, but also its neighboring countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and sometimes Sri Lanka and the Maldives. These nations share a common historical, cultural, and geological background, which further justifies the terminology."},{"question":"This was my first visit to The Greene House, and I was really impressed.

As one of the most distinguished opera singers of our time, Terfel's illustrious career spans more than three decades and has included countless unforgettable performances and accolades. A testament to his profound artistry and profound impact on the world of classical music, Terfel has now been awarded one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon an individual by the British monarch – a knighthood in the New Year Honours list for 2021. Born in Pant Glas, a small village in North Wales, Bryn Terfel Jones displayed a passion and talent for music from a remarkably young age. Raised by a family that valued and encouraged his love of classical music, he honed his skills and worked tirelessly to perfect his craft. His hard work paid off when, in 1989, he made his professional debut at the Welsh National Opera as Guglielmo in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \\"Così fan tutte.\\" From that illustrious beginning, Terfel has gone on to play an array of iconic roles in the world's most prestigious opera houses, from the Metropolitan Opera in New York to the Royal Opera House in London. Some of his most remarkable performances include his portrayal of Mephistopheles in Charles Gounod's \\"Faust,\\" Figaro in Gioachino Rossini's \\"The Barber of Seville,\\" and the title role in Giuseppe Verdi's \\"Falstaff.\\" Terfel is particularly famous for his interpretations of the works of Richard Strauss – especially the role of Baron Ochs in Der Rosenkavalier – and of Richard Wagner's characters, such as Wotan in \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\\" and Hans Sachs in \\"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.\\" Terfel's accomplishments extend well beyond his extraordinary operatic performances. As a celebrated recitalist, he has performed on some of the most prestigious stages worldwide, showcasing an eclectic repertoire from traditional Welsh and Irish folk songs to contemporary works by composers such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Additionally, he has been a dedicated advocate for the arts, investing in the promotion and development of young talents through initiatives such as the Bryn Terfel Foundation, which provides scholarships and mentoring for up-and-coming artists. Throughout his career, Terfel has received a plethora of accolades in recognition of his exceptional contributions to the world of classical music. Among these are an honorary doctorate from the Royal Academy of Music, a Grammy Award, a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), and a Companion of Honour. As of the New Year Honours list for 2021, he now adds the title of \\"Sir\\" to that impressive resume. The knighthood awarded to Terfel is an acknowledgment of his indelible impact on the opera world and his unwavering commitment to preserving and advancing the success and legacy of classical music. It is a testament not only to his incredible talent, but to his dedication, perseverance, and integrity. As Sir Bryn Terfel steps into a new and triumphant chapter of his career, he will continue to inspire generations of opera goers and performers alike with his captivating voice and unparalleled artistry. Knighted and ever-enduring, Terfel's legacy will live on as a beacon of excellence, proving that the magic of opera can – and does – transcend borders, cultures, and backgrounds to unite us all in the shared beauty of human expression."},{"question":"Q: Carrier proteins bind and carry the molecules across what cell structure?

Greece averted the immediate threat of an uncontrolled default on Thursday when it successfully concluded a bond swap deal under which private sector creditors agreed to accept deep cuts in the value of their holdings. \\"There is now more than just recession, budget cuts and tax increases ... there's the hope to turn the wheel of growth,\\" he told a party conference. In a sharp reminder of the deep unpopularity of the austerity measures he has overseen, a pensioner on crutches hurled yoghurt at the burly Venizelos just before his speech, forcing him to delay his appearance to change clothes. Venizelos, the dominant figure in the party since his appointment to the finance portfolio by former Prime Minister George Papandreou last year, is expected to win PASOK's leadership comfortably in an internal vote on March 18. However opinion polls show the Socialists far behind the conservative New Democracy party ahead of elections expected by mid-May at the latest. Both PASOK and New Democracy are in the coalition government headed by former central banker Lucas Papademos but have been openly jockeying for position in the runup to the elections, which may not produce a clear winner. Formed in November, Papademos' emergency coalition government had a narrow mandate to complete bailout and debt cut talks and then hold elections as soon as possible. A government official said Greeks may go to the polls as early as the end of April once the final details of the bond restructuring are in place. The so-called Private Sector Involvement (PSI) is a key component of the 130 billion-euro (170.55 billion) rescue package agreed last month with the European Union and International Monetary Fund and is expected to be approved following Thursday's bond swap. Once the debt swap operation is finally completed on April 12, when a smaller tranche of bonds worth at least 20 billion euros will be exchanged, Greece can go ahead with new elections, an official said. \\"I imagine it (the elections) will be somewhere then,\\" government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis told Skai television when asked if the polls would take place on April 29 or on one of the following Sundays. Whoever wins the poll, Greece will have to stick to the reforms it has promised, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned. \\"Greece must stick to its obligations after the election. That's the basis for the (bailout) program,\\" he said in an interview with Greek newspaper To Vima. Austerity measures associated with the policies have plunged the Greek economy into its longest and deepest slump since World War Two and there is no clear sign of a return to the kind of growth that could help cut its crippling debt pile. Underlining the dire state of an economy in which unemployment is running at 21 percent with one in two young people out of work, data on Friday showed gross domestic product shrank by a record 7 percent in 2011. Investment slumped by 21 percent after a 15 percent slide in 2010. Central bank governor George Provopoulos said this week's bond restructuring would allow Greece to begin the long journey towards regaining the trust of investors. \\"This is a new opportunity ... to gradually restore confidence in the economy's prospects,\\" he was quoted as saying in financial newspaper Imerisia. As the government struggles to stabilize the economy, a senior official said there were hopes of getting 1 billion euros in financing from the European Investment Bank (EIB) this year as a stimulus to encourage investment. Greece and the European Commission are pushing the EIB, the European Union's long-term investment arm, to disburse the funds, said Gikas Hardouvelis, top economic adviser to Papademos. \\"The faster we do it, the better. The economy is sinking and everyone is too scared (to invest),\\" Hardouvelis told Mega television (Additional reporting by Michael Shields in Vienna; editing by Andrew Roche) What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of this text are that Greece has avoided an uncontrolled default on its debt by completing a bond swap deal with private sector creditors. This means that the focus in Athens has now shifted towards upcoming elections once an international bailout deal is cleared. The Greek Finance Minister, Evangelos Venizelos, has submitted his candidacy to lead the Socialist PASOK party. The elections are expected to take place around the end of April. The Greek economy is currently facing high unemployment and a large reduction in Gross Domestic Product."},{"question":"A school bus has 4 columns and 10 rows of seats. If the school has 6 buses, how many students can the buses accommodate? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Determine the number of seats in one row of a school bus. A school bus has 4 columns of seats. So in one row, there are 4 seats. Step 2: Determine the total number of seats in a single school bus. A school bus has 10 rows of seats. Since there are 4 seats in one row, multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in a row to find the total number of seats in a bus: 10 rows * 4 seats per row = 40 seats Step 3: Determine the total number of seats in all 6 school buses. The school has 6 buses, and we have determined that each bus has 40 seats. Multiply the number of buses by the number of seats per bus to find the total number of seats in all buses: 6 buses * 40 seats per bus = 240 seats Step 4: Determine the number of students the school buses can accommodate.

She is also a highly skilled race car driver, but is sometimes haunted by memories of her father's death at a NASCAR race many years ago. Meanwhile, on another side of town, Carlo (Nathan Phillips) has just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. He meets up with his brother Jason (Jesse Johnson) before heading to Vegas themselves. Carlo is not happy that Jason is living with their mob boss uncle Michael D'Orazio (Angus Macfadyen), whom he always sees as the cause of their family's destruction. Little do they know that Michael has been running an unsuccessful counterfeiting ring and owes millions of dollars to another syndicate led by the \\"Godfather\\" (David Dayan Fisher). On the outskirts of Vegas, a high-stakes race event is being held, with Michael, Infamous, Hollywood producer Jerry Brecken (Tim Matheson) and Chinese businessman Marcus Cheng (Michael Hagiwara) placing their bets over who has the better car. When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for 300,000 and a recording contract. However, she is unaware that Infamous has to place her on his wager, as Michael - who has been obsessed with her since watching her band perform on stage earlier - has placed four platinum bars at stake. At the same time, Brecken wagers his brand-new Enzo Ferrari on Natasha. Natasha (driving a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren) takes on Jason (driving a Lamborghini Diablo).

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out.

Ihre Fähigkeit, Waren effizient und kostengünstig herzustellen, hat es ihnen ermöglicht, sich erfolgreich auf internationaler Ebene zu positionieren und ihre Präsenz auf globalen Märkten auszubauen. Wenn diese asiatischen Länder weiterhin Märkte erobern und weltweit expandieren, könnte dies die Wachstumsaussichten für Lateinamerika erheblich beeinträchtigen. Dies würde dazu führen, dass die lateinamerikanischen Länder Schwierigkeiten haben, mit den asiatischen Wirtschaftsmächten auf dem internationalen wirtschaftlichen und Handelsschauplatz zu konkurrieren.

Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.","response":"The first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas, as mentioned in the article, is Giacomo.

Israel does not have a constitution, but the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \\"The State of Israel (...) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\\" Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. In 2012, Israel ranked eleventh out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. Since the founding of the State of Israel, relatively few women have served in the Israeli government, and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman--Golda Meir--has served as Prime Minister, it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government. Although the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \\"The State of Israel (...) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,\\" the Haredi political parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) have never allowed women on their lists for Knesset elections. However, in December 2014, women activists in the Haredi community have threatened a boycott of Haredi parties in upcoming elections if women are not included in election slates. As of 2016, women comprised 26.7% of Israel's 120-member Knesset, placing it 54th of 185 countries in which women are included in the legislature. For comparison, the female ratio in Scandinavia is over 40%, the European Union average is 17.6%, while in the Arab world it is 6.4%. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from religious Jewish or Arab parties. In January 1986 Israeli female teacher Leah Shakdiel was granted membership in the religious council of Yeruham, but the Minister of Religious Affairs Zvulun Hammer canceled her membership on the grounds that women should not serve in that capacity. In early 1987 a petition was submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court regarding this incident. The Supreme Court precedent-setting ruling was unanimously accepted in Shakdiel's favor, and in 1988 Shakdiel became the first woman in Israel to serve in a religious council. In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called \\"U'Bizchutan: Haredi Women Making Change.\\" Who was the first female in leadership in Israel?","response":"The first female in leadership in Israel was Golda Meir.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lamp in the flashlight works properly happens, how will it affect a GREATER spread of the virus. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"To answer the question, let's analyze the perturbation hypothesis and its effects on the virus spreading process step-by-step. Perturbation Hypothesis: The lamp in the flashlight works properly. This perturbation deals with a flashlight's proper functioning and does not seem to have an immediate connection to the virus spreading process. 1. A virus enters a host body. The flashlight's functionality does not directly or indirectly affect this stage. The entry of a virus depends on the host's exposure to the virus, such as through respiratory droplets, touch, or other transmission methods. 2. The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell. The flashlight's functionality has no impact on the interaction between viral receptors and target cells because it is a biochemical process that takes place inside the host's body. 3. The virus enters the cell. Similar to the previous step, the lamp in the flashlight working properly does not have any direct or indirect impact on the virus's ability to enter the cell. 4. The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus. Again, the flashlight's functionality does not come into play during the replication of the virus inside the host cells. 5. The new copies of the virus leave the cell. As with the previous steps, there is no effect of a working flashlight on the virus's ability to exit the cells and spread. 6. Infect other cells. No impact on the virulence or ability of the virus to infect other cells is observed, given the hypothesis on flashlight functionality. 7. The host gets sick as its cells are damaged. The physical condition of the host and cellular damage result from the virus spreading in the host's body. The flashlight's functionality has no impact on this process. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation (the lamp in the flashlight working properly) does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of the virus spreading. The virus spreading process inside a host body is a series of biochemical interactions, independent of an unrelated external factor such as a flashlight."},{"question":"Quoc: Forged in Fire is an American competition series that airs on the History channel, and is produced by Outpost Entertainment, a Leftfield Entertainment company.

Is bakelite a condensation polymer? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choices: (A). no. (B). yes.","response":"Yes, both questions are related to bakelite being a condensation polymer. So the answer is (B). yes. Now, let me explain what a condensation polymer is and why bakelite is one. A condensation polymer is a type of plastic that is made by joining small molecules together in a chemical reaction that also forms water or another simple molecule as a byproduct. Think of it like building a toy train by connecting individual train cars together. Each time you connect two cars, a small toy person (water or another simple molecule) is also formed. Bakelite is a condensation polymer because it is made from two small molecules - phenol and formaldehyde - that combine together in a chemical reaction to form a bigger molecule called a polymer. This process also creates water as a byproduct. So, just like how we connected the toy train cars, bakelite is made from smaller pieces that join together, and that's why it is called a condensation polymer."},{"question":"Diese Informationen werden auch genutzt um Statistiken zu erstellen.

In more detail, data gathered from various sources can be compiled and analyzed to produce meaningful insights and trends. This process greatly benefits various industries, businesses, governments, and individuals, as it facilitates informed decision-making and helps predict future developments. Statistics can be created from several types of information, including demographic data, economic indicators, educational data, and health-related data, among others. These data sets can be collected through surveys, studies, experiments, observations, or other methods, depending on the information's nature and the intended purpose of the analysis. Once the data is collected, it can be organized, categorized, and structured to facilitate processing and analysis. This step often involves cleaning and filtering the data, as well as eliminating irrelevant or duplicate information that might skew the analysis. Statistical tools, including software and programming languages like R, Python, or advanced statistics software like SPSS, are then employed to analyze the data. Through the data analysis process, raw information is transformed into statistically significant patterns and trends that can be used to understand various phenomena better and make predictions about possible future outcomes. For example, businesses might use sales data to identify their best-selling products, target their marketing efforts, and optimize their production processes. Governments might analyze economic data to inform their fiscal policies, education data to develop new curricula, or health-related data to implement new public health initiatives. In the age of big data, the importance of employing high-quality statistical analysis techniques has grown exponentially to ensure accuracy and reliability when analyzing large and complex data sets.

Options: - (A) Energy. - (B) voltage - (C) heat produced - (D) heat energy - (E) electrons - (F) a solute - (G) kinetic - (H) Energy Let's think step by step below.","response":"When substances react with one another, they undergo chemical changes due to the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms. Therefore, the correct answer is: - (E) electrons Let's break down the process step by step: 1. Atoms and molecules consist of positively charged protons, negatively charged electrons, and neutral neutrons. In a chemical reaction, the arrangement of these particles changes as substances react and transform into new substances. 2. During a chemical reaction, atoms either share electrons or transfer electrons between them in order to achieve a more stable electron configuration. This change in electron configuration leads to the formation of new chemical bonds and, ultimately, new substances. 3. This process of sharing or transfer of electrons is governed by the principle of electronegativity, which dictates the relative attraction of atoms to electrons. Elements with high electronegativity values attract electrons more strongly, while those with lower values tend to give up electrons more readily. 4. There are two main types of chemical reactions involving the sharing or transfer of electrons: - In ionic reactions, electrons are completely transferred from one atom (usually a metal) to another (usually a non-metal), resulting in the formation of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). These ions are then attracted to each other and form ionic compounds. - In covalent reactions, electrons are shared between atoms (usually non-metals) to create covalent bonds. Each atom contributes one or more electrons to the shared pair, which allows both atoms to achieve stable electron configurations. Now that we have a better understanding of the process, we can confidently say that option (E) electrons is the correct choice, as it is the sharing or transfer of electrons that drives chemical reactions between substances."},{"question":"Question: If dNA and RNA work together to create albumin, then what do DNA and RNA work together to create?

This service has not only provided convenient transportation to the many city dwellers who are out late at night, but it has also boosted the city's economy and provided job opportunities. In this article, we will explore the impact of the Night Tube service on London's transportation, the economy, and the city's vibrant nightlife. A Major Leap in Overnight Transportation Launched in August 2016, the Night Tube service has become an indispensable part of London's transportation network. With around 300,000 journeys being made every weekend, it is clear that the service has been well-received by London's residents and visitors alike. The ability to travel around the city 24 hours a day on weekends provides flexibility and convenience to those who work or play in the late hours of the night. The Night Tube service currently operates on five lines: the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines. By offering late-night access to these key transport arteries, the Night Tube is helping to keep the city moving during the night and reducing reliance on other forms of public transportation or private taxi services. The Economic Impact of the Night Tube Service The introduction of the Night Tube service has had a significant impact on London's economy, particularly in the areas of tourism, hospitality, and entertainment. With the ease of overnight travel, visitors from around the world can take full advantage of London's diverse nightlife offerings, from West End theaters and restaurants to pubs, clubs, and live music venues. By boosting the city's tourism sector, the Night Tube also indirectly contributes to job creation and economic opportunities. According to a study by consulting firm EY, the service supports around 3,600 jobs and adds £171 million annually to London's economy. These figures are expected to increase as the Night Tube service extends to other lines and as tourists and business travelers continue to flock to the city. Enhancing London's Vibrant Nightlife The Night Tube service has made London's nightlife more accessible and convenient for both locals and international visitors. From partygoers heading out for a night on the town to late-night shift workers making their way home, the overnight service provides a safe and reliable means of transportation. Furthermore, the Night Tube service has led to the growth and expansion of London's popular nighttime events, such as the city's numerous street food markets and late-night gallery and museum openings. With more efficient transportation options available, these cultural events are now more attractive to patrons and offer an added incentive for attendees. The Future of the Night Tube Service The success of the Night Tube service is undeniable, and discussions are ongoing about extending the service to other lines and potentially introducing a 24-hour weekend bus service to complement the Night Tube. These proposed expansions could further improve the availability and convenience of overnight transportation, solidifying London's reputation as a city that never sleeps. Conclusion The Night Tube service has truly revolutionized London's overnight transportation scene, with a considerable impact on the city's economy and nightlife. With 300,000 journeys being made every weekend, it's evident that the service is fulfilling its promise of providing convenient transportation during the late hours. As the service continues to expand, London can look forward to even greater economic benefits and increased accessibility to the city's vibrant nightlife offerings. The Night Tube is undoubtedly a testament to the city's innovative spirit and dedication to ensuring a world-class experience for its residents and visitors alike."},{"question":"Answer the following question: He had apparently spaced out for a second or two.

Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels? Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

The SPF measurement on sunscreens refers to the UVB protection level -- and the number may not mean what you think it does. SPF 15 doesn't protect you from 15% of UVB rays, just as SPF 100 doesn't protect you from 100% of the rays. In fact, as you get into the higher numbered SPF sunscreens (think: 50 and above), the difference in UVB protection is actually pretty small. Theoretically, though the increase in UVB protection with a super-high SPF sunscreen may be not worth considering, it may help, and certainly can't hurt, to use it -- that is, as long as you do so correctly. \\"The only _ is whether you're giving yourself a sense of false security,\\" Dr. Gohara says. Indeed, as Dr. Wang also pointed out, when people choose increased SPFs, they may actually feel so protected by the product that they finally ignore proper sun protection. \\"When people use really high SPF products, they tend not to reuse, they tend to stay out in the sun much longer, and they don't use other protective measures such as clothing and hats,\\" he says. Regardless of any increase in protection that a high SPF may or may not offer, one thing is certain: It doesn't give your body a free pass from sunburns, aging, or cancers, and it doesn't protect you from those things for any greater length of time than the lower SPF options. Both Dr. Wang and Dr. Gohara emphasized that, no matter what the SPF is, it's important to reapply your sunscreen every two hours. Why are we advised to reapply our sunscreen every two hours? A) We choose too low SPF products. B) The higher SPF can make us stay outside longer. C) Clothing and hats are not enough for sun protection. D) It can't completely protect us from aging, sunburns or cancers. Answer:","response":"D) We are advised to reapply our sunscreen every two hours because it can't completely protect us from aging, sunburns, or cancers. No matter the SPF level, sunscreen's effectiveness diminishes over time due to various factors, such as sweating, swimming, and rubbing.

The disease is surging in the state, which has seen at least 381 cases this year, compared to just 27 last year; 95% of tested Houston mosquitoes were carrying the virus, the Los Angeles Times reports. \\"Texas is on track to have the worst year ever for West Nile virus,\\" an official says. The statewide death toll stands at 16. Officials blame a warm winter and wet spring; human and bird activity can also play a role, a CDC epidemiologist says.

The virus can turn into West Nile fever or a range of other, more threatening diseases—though \\"less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness,\\" says a CDC rep, according to CNN. An expert points out that 90% of the victims she has studied took no precautions (like wearing bug spray). Expand this summary.","response":"The West Nile virus outbreak in Dallas County, Texas, has led to a state of emergency being declared due to a significant increase in cases and fatalities. So far this year, the county has reported 10 deaths from the virus, and Texas as a whole has seen at least 381 cases, compared to only 27 the previous year. This surge has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a warm winter and wet spring, as well as human and bird activity. Houston, in particular, has been hit hard with 95% of tested mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times. \\"Texas is on track to have the worst year ever for West Nile virus,\\" warns a Texas health official. The statewide death toll currently stands at 16. However, it should be noted that Texas is not the only state battling the virus. Louisiana and Mississippi have each reported 39 cases, including one death each, while Oklahoma has experienced 22 cases. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) epidemiologist remarked, \\"We're probably hitting the peak nationally,\\" indicating a concerning trend for the country. The West Nile virus can manifest in various forms, from West Nile fever to more severe and threatening diseases. However, less than 1% of those infected develop serious neurological illnesses, says a CDC representative, as cited by CNN. It's important to note that many of those who contract the virus can be asymptomatic or only experience mild flu-like symptoms. In most cases, individuals recover without complications. Nonetheless, prevention and caution are essential to mitigate the risk of infection. An expert in the field highlighted that 90% of the West Nile virus victims she studied did not take any precautions, such as wearing bug spray or protective clothing. Residents in affected areas should take preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites, including using insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and removing standing water from their properties where mosquitoes might breed. As the outbreak continues to spread, Dallas County officials have taken action by approving aerial anti-mosquito spraying to combat the virus and control the mosquito population. This measure, alongside individual preventive actions, forms part of a comprehensive effort to address the escalating health crisis and protect the public from further transmission of the West Nile virus."},{"question":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Blue Spice eatType restaurant; Blue Spice food Japanese; Blue Spice area riverside","response":"Blue Spice is a riverside restaurant where you can eat yummy Japanese food while enjoying beautiful water views."},{"question":"Does \\"In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent \\"to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury\\".\\" correctly answer the question of When did Sybaris offer patents?","response":"Yes, the statement \\"In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent 'to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury'.\\" correctly answers the question of when Sybaris offered patents.

In recent years, the global push towards reducing carbon emissions and the strong advocacy for renewable energy have gradually influenced the energy policies of various countries. An increasing number of governments, including the United States, are considering making a nationwide shift to renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power, and hydroelectric power to minimize the environmental impact of traditional fossil fuels. With the potential for significant change in energy production and consumption patterns, this context aims to explore the ramifications of such a nationwide shift on the employment landscape across various sectors. Hypothesis: A nationwide shift to renewable energy sources will lead to an overall net increase in employment opportunities, coupled with re-skilling challenges for impacted workers. If a country were to make a drastic move towards embracing renewable energy, the direct implication would be a surge in demand for the technologies, materials, and expertise required for the development, production, installation, and maintenance of these cleaner energy sources. The hypothesis posits that this increased demand will, on balance, create a greater number of employment opportunities within the renewable energy sector. These new jobs may include roles in research and development, manufacturing, construction, installation, operations, and maintenance. Additionally, the hypothesis suggests that this job market shift would not be limited to the energy sector only and that the overall net employment benefit would encompass multiple sectors due to the ripple effect. For instance, the demand for electric vehicles would likely grow as part of the push for cleaner energy, creating opportunities in the automotive industry. Similarly, increased interest in energy-efficient building designs could boost the construction sector. While offering a promising outlook in terms of job growth, the hypothesis also acknowledges the inevitable challenges that come with the transition to renewables. Workers from shrinking industries, such as coal and oil, could face job displacement, necessitating either re-skilling or up-skilling to find new employment in the renewable sector. There is also a possibility of job polarization, wherein low-skilled and high-skilled positions grow, but those in the middle experience contraction. In conclusion, the hypothesis posits that a nationwide shift to renewable energy sources will result in a net increase in employment opportunities across various sectors, but that this transformation will not come without challenges. Addressing these challenges will require targeted policies supporting workforce re-skilling and up-skilling, as well as adequate safety nets for the workers most affected by the changes."},{"question":"Question: - Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract What might be the last step of the process?

Why he won will remain a matter of some dispute. Given the piss-poor accuracy of Israeli polls, we’ll never know for sure whether Netanyahu stormed back from a deficit or not. Nonetheless, Netanyahu’s last-minute rhetoric left a bad taste in some observer’s mouths. Some conservatives question the significance of that rhetoric. But as The Washington Post’s Steven Mufson noted: Benjamin Netanyahu’s triumph in Tuesday’s parliamentary elections keeps in place an Israeli prime minister who has declared his intention to resist Obama on both of these fronts, guaranteeing two more years of difficult diplomacy between leaders who barely conceal their personal distaste for each other. The Israeli election results also suggest that most voters there support Netanyahu’s tough stance on U.S.-led negotiations to limit Iran’s nuclear program and his vow on Monday that there would be no independent Palestinian state as long as he is prime minister. The key question, to quote Joss Whedon, is: Where do we go from here? The short-term answer seems pretty damn clear. One of President Obama’s favorite aphorisms is “elections have consequences.” By late Wednesday, the administration had signaled those consequences to three press outlets. First up: Foreign Policy’s John Hudson and Colum Lynch: After years of blocking U.N. efforts to pressure Israelis and Palestinians into accepting a lasting two-state solution, the United States is edging closer toward supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution that would call for the resumption of political talks to conclude a final peace settlement, according to Western diplomats…. “The more the new government veers to the right the more likely you will see something in New York,” said a Western diplomat. And then there’s Politico’s Michael Crowley, with quotes from senior administration officials: The positions taken by the prime minister in the last days of the campaign have raised very significant substantive questions that go far beyond just optics,” said a senior administration official, adding that recent Israeli government actions were in keeping with Netanyahu’s rhetoric. While saying it was “premature” to discuss Washington’s policy response, the official wouldn’t rule out a modified American posture at the United Nations, where the U.S. has long fended off resolutions criticizing Israeli settlement activity and demanding its withdrawal from Palestinian territories. “We are signaling that if the Israeli government’s position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state, we’re going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward,” the official said. And finally, the New York Times’ Helene Cooper and Michael D. Shear, have a “senior White House official” quote: Such a Security Council resolution would be anathema to Mr. Netanyahu. Although the principles are United States policy, until now officials would never have endorsed them in the United Nations because the action would have been seen as too antagonistic to Israel. “The premise of our position internationally has been to support direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians,” a senior White House official said. “We are now in a reality where the Israeli government no longer supports direct negotiations. Therefore we clearly have to factor that into our decisions going forward.” Yeah, as signals go, this one seems pretty clear: Elections have consequences, and those consequences will be uncomfortable for Benjamin Netanyahu. So, is this simply a fit of administration pique, or is there a larger strategic purpose in mind? Or, to put it more plainly, if there is a strategic purpose, does the strategy make sense? There are three ways to look at this. The first, as FP’s Hudson and Lynch note, is that the administration will accede to action at the UN Security Council, “as an alternative to the Palestinian effort to hold Israel accountable at the [International Criminal Court.]” So ,really, the administration is playing defense at the UN to save Israel a worse outcome. This strikes me as too charitable an interpretation, especially given this (from Cooper and Shear): In strikingly strong criticism, the White House called Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign rhetoric, in which he railed against Israeli Arabs because they went out to vote, an attempt to “marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens” and inconsistent with the values that bind Israel and the United States. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters traveling with Mr. Obama on Air Force One on Wednesday that Mr. Netanyahu’s statement was “deeply concerning and it is divisive and I can tell you that these are views the administration intends to communicate directly to the Israelis.” A second possibility is that the administration is trying to influence the nature of Netanyahu’s coalition. By signaling possible repercussions now, the administration hopes that the eventual Netanyahu cabinet will prove more amenable to negotiations with the Palestinians than the campaign rhetoric suggested. As the Monkey Cage’s Nadav Shelef notes, the narrow win set of the emergent right-wing coalition government will put Netanyahu in a tight corner: Netanyahu is therefore likely to face a choice between somehow engaging in negotiations – and thereby destabilizing his government – or refusing to do so at the cost of increasing Israel’s isolation in the world; isolation that, if combined with increasing E.U. sanctions, would drastically impact Israel’s economy and shrink the pie available for redistribution. This scenario would only exacerbate the looming political fight over Israel’s budget. In either case, we can expect Israel to face new elections in the not-too-distant future. There is one last bank-shot possibility that’s worth considering — that the intended audience for these signals isn’t Israel but Iran. Netanyahu’s victory, combined with the Senate letter from last week, provide ammunition to Iranian hard-liners who do not want to see a nuclear deal with the P5+1. They’d argue that Obama is weak and therefore cannot be trusted to carry out any nuclear deal. One of the ways that leaders can signal intentions to adversaries is to take costly actions that separate them from leaders who would otherwise be bluffing. The administration’s huffing and puffing on Israel will certainly generate some political costs: OBAMA PLOTS TO BYPASS BIBI WITH UN ACTION http://t.co/XPHrWOufkB — DRUDGE REPORT (@DRUDGE_REPORT) March 19, 2015 So maybe Obama’s throat-clearing exercise is designed to tell his Iranian counterparts that he’s still committed to implementing any nuclear deal. These possible explanations are not mutually exclusive. But I do hope the administration really does have one of these in mind, because otherwise this looks like a fit of pique against a difficult but longstanding ally. And pique is not the right way to run the foreign policy railroad.

The verb \\"to be\\" is \\"být\\" in Czech, and its negative form in the past tense for the 3rd person singular (it) is \\"nebylo\\". 3. \\"you\\" - In Czech, the pronoun \\"you\\" can be translated as \\"ty\\" (informal) or \\"vy\\" (formal). We'll use the informal version \\"ty\\" since the original sentence in English is informal as well.

LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A judge declared a mistrial in the murder case against music legend Phil Spector after a jury announced for the second time in eight days that it was hopelessly deadlocked. Phil Spector did not testify at his five-month murder trial. The jury said it was split 10-2. The jury deliberated for 12 days, taking six ballots, but was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Jurors told Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler they were split 10-2, without indicating which way they were leaning. They added there was nothing Fidler could do to help them arrive at a unanimous verdict.","response":"Imagine you're playing a game where all 12 of your friends have to agree on a single answer.

This is similar to a \\"deadlock\\" in court - like in this case where 10 people thought one way and 2 people thought another. They discussed it over and over again for 12 days but still couldn't agree. This kind of disagreement is very serious in court, especially in a murder case. So, the judge, who is like the mature, responsible adult overseeing the game, decided they could not continue and declared a \\"mistrial\\" - which is like stopping the game because you can't agree on what to play. The man they were deciding about, Phil Spector, is a very famous music maker, like the person who made your favorite songs. But he was in trouble because some people thought he might have done something very bad – murder. But since the friends (or in this case, the jurors) couldn't agree if he did or didn't, the judge had to stop the trial. The judge is like a teacher in your school, kind of a referee, who has the power to stop a game or a trial. In this passage, the reporter doesn't tell us if most friends thought Phil was guilty (like he did do the bad thing) or not guilty (like he didn't do the bad thing).

Go in there on a Friday or Saturday night and you won't find harder working drink slingers anywhere in the city. There's usually only two people manning the bar, but considering how packed it gets sometimes, the wait is pretty short. - Their frites (6) are shoestring style and awesome; they come with curry ketchup, garlic aioli and chipotle mayo. - The rest of their menu is well-priced pub-grub and the kitchen serves until 11. - The upstairs dance floor and adjoining bar sometimes have a cover for live bands or djs, but it's generally reasonable and on occasion their dance party themes are pure magic (Sweet Lovely Death: A 1970's punk dj dance party, I'm lookin' at you). - The atmosphere is relaxed.

He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \\"big pie\\" from it, and is given a \\"pig sty\\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes. During tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage.

It is a far cry from the grand properties in which she once lived. She will have to use on-street parking and get used to having neighbours.","response":"Title: From Grand Mansions to Terraced Houses: Miss Turner's New Life in South-West London Introduction South-West London has recently become home to a new, notable resident: Miss Turner. Leaving behind her previous luxurious mansions, Miss Turner now resides in a terraced house in the bustling urban center, paying £6,000 a month in rent. This lifestyle change means adapting to new experiences like dealing with neighbours and finding on-street parking, but Miss Turner seems prepared to embrace these challenges with open arms. A Shift from Grand Properties Gone are the days where Miss Turner lived in palatial residences, complete with expansive gardens and multi-car garages. Having once enjoyed the serenity and privacy that comes with sprawling estates, Turner has now opted for a simpler life in a charming terraced house that offers proximity to local amenities and vibrant city attractions. The terraced home, which now welcomes Miss Turner with its cosy atmosphere, fetches a monthly rent of £6,000. It represents a more practical choice when compared to her previous luxurious accommodations, allowing Miss Turner to fully immerse herself in London's bustling life and all that this dynamic city has to offer. Adjusting to City Life: Parking and Neighbours One of the most significant changes Miss Turner will experience in her new South-West London home is on-street parking. As a former resident of grand properties, Turner once had the luxury of personal driveways and spacious garages that provided ample parking space. Now, she must navigate the crowded streets of London in search of a spot for her vehicle. In addition to parking, another new aspect of Miss Turner's life will be getting accustomed to having neighbours. While grand estates can offer privacy and seclusion, life in a terraced house brings with it the challenges and joys of being part of a close-knit community. From neighbourly exchanges to navigating the occasional disputes, Miss Turner is on her way to becoming a seasoned Londoner as she adapts to the city's unique way of life. Conclusion As Miss Turner settles into her new South-West London terraced house, she's bound to experience several changes from her previous grand abodes. With the challenges of on-street parking and neighbourly interactions, Miss Turner demonstrates her adaptability and willingness to embrace all that city living entails. And though her current home may be a far cry from the sprawling mansions she once occupied, the experience will undoubtedly enrich and broaden her perspective on life in a thriving urban environment."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a target profession, and two sentences.

The force field protected networks, who needed series to run until there was no more profit to be extracted from them, and fans, who could watch through their fingers knowing their favorites could never really die because their names were too high up in the credits. The mark of many “serious” dramas these days has been their willingness to power down that force field. As the likes of Game of Thrones and Boardwalk Empire killed off major stars with relish, it announced their daring, their commitment to drama over fandom, their willingness to go there. Now some TV fans and critics have become a kind of capital jury, deciding which characters “need” to die and when. Go on, Sons of Anarchy, kill off [name redacted]–if you’ve got the cojones! So did Nicholas Brody need to die? Well, he at least needed to go, lethally or not. He was a character in a CIA drama whose connection to any CIA operation had to be justified by more and more implausible twists over the last two seasons, as he went from war hero to terrorist suspect to congressman to assassin to wrongly framed terrorist to international fugitive to junkie to assassin again, but for the other team. (Homeland is a show that’s best enjoyed if you don’t stop to summarize its story turns in a sentence.) With Abu Nazir gone and Brody’s intel value gone with him, there was nothing to keep Brody relevant to the espionage storylines short of a implanting a computer chip in his brain. And while you can certainly find drama in a man trying to redeem himself to his estranged motel-housecleaner daughter, Homeland was not the show to do it (though it tried). It wasn’t so much that Brody needed to die as that, as a plausible character, he died at least a year ago, and probably two. Homeland wanted to be two things: a romance between two damaged soldiers and a fast-moving political-minded thriller that was honest about the implications of that damage. Its first season could have brought those two things together devastatingly; instead, it fell in love with its love story and, like Brody, couldn’t pull the trigger on its explosive vest. Season two began strong, and the searing showdown between Carrie and Brody in “Q&A” suggested the contrivances might all have been worth it. But as the show’s plot spiraled like a top losing its balance, it became clear that Brody’s survival was Homeland’s Monkey’s Paw, a case of wishing the dead back with, horrible results. Season three was a lower-stakes, more focused season, but more than that, in retrospect it was an attempt to call backsies on that early decision. It was not exactly more believable; Iran, for instance, is apparently a country that the CIA can infiltrate only dangerously under cover of darkness, or by booking a flight and checking into a nice hotel. But “The Star” gave Brody and Carrie closure, their run to the safehouse recalling their cabin getaway in the first season, and his redemption was fittingly dark, as he was hanged before a jeering crowd and denied a hero’s honor by his country. (Though the episode was fuzzy on just how Brody’s last act was received in the world: did the world “see him through [Carrie's] eyes” now, or was his heroism ignored?) Like American Idol contestants investing an awful ballad with emotion, Claire Danes and Damian Lewis managed to find the heart in the most jury-rigged scenarios. But even if there was–as Brody meta-acknowledged in the safehouse–nowhere left to go with the character, Homeland and Showtime deserve credit for doing what the story called for. Yeah, the writers had painted themselves into a corner, but Homeland had a big, loyal following of Brody-and-Carrie fans who would have been glad for it to keep painting that corner, even if it had to climb up the wall toward the ceiling. Those fans sent the show’s ratings ever higher even as it became a critics’ target, and there’s no guarantee they’ll come back for a show about–who? what? Carrie as Istanbul station chief? Saul Berenson, private intelligence contractor? Quinn, your new replacement Brody? Carrie’s baby-visitation arrangements with her in-laws the Brodys? (All this, of course, assumes that Brody isn’t just going to turn up next year like the unkillable “cockroach” we were told he was, with a scar on his neck and a debt to Javadi for arranging his fake execution.) The show could reboot itself now as the realpolitik espionage drama it occasionally was. It could have space now to explore some of the more interesting characters it ended up sidelining. (For instance Fara, the Muslim analyst whose loyalties were doubted both by her government and her family, had a promising storyline that just sort of evaporated this year.) But it will be a tough assignment. Those of us who long thought Brody was past his expiration date might decide the plot holes are just too big for fine performances and Saul’s majestic beard to cover up. And fans who bought in for the Brody-Carrie love story–the story that Homeland has spent three seasons tell us was the essential reason to watch–are likely looking for something else to do Sundays next fall. The title “The Star,” after all, doesn’t just refer to the emblem Carrie Sharpied onto the CIA wall at the end of the episode. It’s what you call a central character–the kind you’re not supposed to kill, under the rules that, as Homeland reminded us, now belong to a different time.

The mountain crumbles and Moses faints at the sight of God's manifestation upon the mountain. In Qushayri's words, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and there was nothing left to Moses of Moses. In that state of annihilation from himself, Moses was granted the unveiling of the realities. From the Sufi point of view, God is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"From the context provided, it is clear that neither Sufi nor Moses reject the concept of God being always the beloved. Rather, both of these perspectives uphold this belief, albeit in subtly different manners. In the case of Moses, as per the recounting of the event in Quran 7:143, he yearned for a direct vision of God, a wish that underscores his deep love and desire for proximity to the divine. Despite the fact that this wish was not granted in the way he might have expected - his suffering upon being shown God's manifestation on the mountain was part of his assigned test - Moses' love for God remains evident. Thus, it is correct to say that, from Moses' point of view, God is unquestionably the beloved. When analyzing Sufi philosophy, the concept of God as the beloved becomes even more profound. Sufism, a mystic tradition within Islam, is notably characterized by its emphasis on love and devotion to God, and its aspirational pursuit of a kind of psychic and spiritual intimacy with Him. Sufis see their journey of faith as a path of continuous longing, and their suffering in this path is perceived as a conduit to the realization of higher truths about God. Their ultimate aim is to attain a state of self-annihilation, where their egoistic self is wholly consumed in the love and consciousness of God - a state of 'fana' in Sufi terminology. This is exemplified in the context where Moses, in his state of annihilation from himself, was granted the unveiling of the divine truths. Thus, both from the perspective of Moses and Sufism, God is always the beloved. Their experiences and expressions of this love might differ, given the dissimilarities between an individual's communion with God and a mystical tradition's overarching philosophy. However, the fundamental conviction tying them together is the unwavering love and deep-seated longing for God. Moses expresses this through his quest for a divine vision, and Sufis through their spiritual journey of longing and self-effacement. Therefore, it can be deduced from the context that neither Sufis nor Moses would claim that 'God is not always the beloved'."},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Polish.

Step-by-step justification: 1. Limestone is located under the soil: This sets the stage for the process, as limestone is a common sedimentary rock that can be dissolved by acidic solutions, such as carbonic acid. 2. Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth: Rainwater becomes slightly acidic by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming a weak carbonic acid solution. 3. The rain falls on the soil over the limestone: The rain, now containing carbonic acid, comes into contact with the soil above the limestone. 4. The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil: The acidic rainwater percolates through the soil, carrying the carbonic acid deeper toward the limestone. 5. The carbon dioxide turns into acid: This step is perhaps redundant, as the rain has already picked up carbon dioxide and formed carbonic acid in the previous steps. 6. The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil: The carbonic acid in the rainwater finally reaches the limestone layer, starting the dissolution process. 7. The acid dissolves the limestone: The carbonic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate in the limestone, gradually dissolving it and creating channels and voids within the rock. 8. Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time: As more acidic rainwater percolates through the soil and comes into contact with the limestone, the dissolution process continues, further eroding the rock. The final step in this process is the formation of caves, sinkholes, and other karst features as a result of the ongoing dissolution of the limestone by acidic rainwater."},{"question":"Hamšarí chystal před pár lety atentát na Ben-Guriona... v Kodani.

Who is \\"they\\"?","response":"In this context, \\"they\\" refers to the members of airline unions who are typically composed of various airline professionals, including pilots, flight attendants, ground staff, and maintenance crews, among others. These individuals come together as a collective and unified group, advocating for their rights, workplace conditions, and fair compensation through unions. The principal reason for the unions constantly going on strike against the airlines for better salaries is to secure higher wages and improved work conditions for their members. Strikes are a form of industrial action used as a negotiation tactic to draw attention to the employees' demands and apply pressure on the airline companies. Although money is often the primary concern, several factors may contribute to the decision to go on strike. These factors include job security, benefits, promotion opportunities, scheduling, pension, and safety regulations. The consistent demand for better salaries and improved working conditions stems from various challenges faced by the airline industry, such as long working hours, irregular schedules, and the necessity for improved safety measures. Unions act as a voice for employees in labor negotiations with the airline companies, and strikes are seen as a last resort when negotiations fail or stall.

Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, hedgerows, mountain slopes and marshes host heather, wild grasses, gorse and bracken.

Politics The answer is:","response":"Title: \\"The Duffy Dilemma\\" Plot Summary: In a small town, Duffy (a wise, old political consultant) discovers the true potential of a young and passionate community leader named Meyers, who has aspirations of climbing the political ladder. Despite his natural talent for uniting people and deep empathy, Meyers gets caught in a web of political corruption that threatens to consume him. Duffy takes it upon himself to advise Meyers on the consequences of choosing moral integrity over political ambition, prompting Meyers to make a life-changing decision. Act One: Introduce Meyers (the protagonist), a charismatic young leader who has the town captivated with his passion for social change. He is approached by a local political party to run for mayor.

Act Two: As Meyers gets drawn into the political arena, Duffy becomes increasingly concerned about Meyers' adoption of less-than-honest tactics to gain an advantage. Duffy urges Meyers to stick to his principles, fearing the town's reaction when they see the person Meyers is becoming.

He hides from the dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him).

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Almost Famous Context: In 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in with the world. His widowed mother Elaine â who has led him to believe he is 12 years old, until William's older sister, Anita, tells their mother to tell the truth, his age is actually 11, from being placed into 1st grade at the age of 5, and skipped 5th grade. Their mother strictly controls and protects him and his older sister Anita, forbidding rock music and other unwelcome influences, driving Anita to leave home and become a flight attendant. In 1973, 15-year-old William, influenced by the rock albums left by his sister, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in San Diego. Rock journalist Lester Bangs, impressed with his writing, gives him a 35 assignment to review a Black Sabbath concert. He can't get backstage, but opening band Stillwater arrives, and after he flatters them with critical praise they bring him along. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him, partly because of William's new friendship with veteran groupie Penny Lane, though she prefers the term Band-Aid. Feigning retirement from her glory days, she takes William under her wing, but only to get close to Russell, for whom she has genuine feelings. William is contacted by Ben Fong-Torres, editor of Rolling Stone, who believes him to be older and hires him to write a story. He convinces Ben to let him write about Stillwater, and he is instructed to go on the road with them. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe are evident. William begins to interview the members of the band, but Russell repeatedly puts it off. Penny watches the interaction and sympathizes with William, whom they joking call \\"the enemy\\" because he's a journalist, but he quickly becomes part of their inner circle as he loses his objectivity. The band experiences problems with promoters and venues on the tour, and hires Dennis, a professional manager. Penny is told she must leave them before New York, where Russell's ex-wife/girlfriend Leslie will... The answer is:","response":"In the movie Almost Famous, various factors contribute to shaping William Miller's emotional state. Growing up, William faces multiple challenges that significantly impact his emotions and the way he perceives the world around him. Firstly, his family situation plays a significant role in shaping his emotional state. Having lost his father and living with a strict, overprotective mother who forbids rock music and other influences she deems unwelcome, William struggles to fit in with the world. Additionally, discovering he was led to believe the wrong age affects his self-identity and adds to his distress. When his older sister Anita leaves home, William feels abandoned but uses the rock albums she left behind as an escape. Secondly, his passion for rock music and aspirations for becoming a rock journalist also shape his emotional journey. William's adventure with the band Stillwater introduces him to a world of excitement, fame, and unpredictability while exposing him to the harsh realities of the music industry. His interactions and relationships with the band members, particularly lead guitarist Russell Hammond and lead singer Jeff Bebe, whom William interviews, create an emotional rollercoaster, as he tries to balance professional objectivity with personal attachment. Furthermore, William's relationship with Penny Lane, a veteran groupie, contributes to his emotional growth. Despite their connection, Penny's true feelings are for Russell, thus complicating William's emotional state. Through this relationship, William learns about love, heartbreak, and the complexities of human emotions. Lastly, the pressure of writing a story for Rolling Stone, a prestigious magazine, and their belief that he is older than he is, as well as touring with Stillwater, adds to his emotional turmoil. William tries to maintain a balance between fulfilling his duties as a rock journalist and navigating the world of rock bands, friendships, love, and loyalty. Throughout the movie, William's experiences help him grow emotionally and provide valuable life lessons on dealing with challenging situations, relationships, and self-discovery.

Purpose of games: The primary purpose of computer games is to provide entertainment, relaxation, and enjoyment to the users. They are designed with engaging elements, immersive storylines, and appealing visuals to give an enjoyable and satisfying experience to the players. 2. Not work: Computer games are not meant to be used as a tool for doing work, such as managing tasks, creating documents, or processing data. While there are educational games that help develop specific skills, their primary focus is still entertainment. 3. Not expensive: The expense related to a computer game depends on the user's choices, such as buying games, in-game purchases, and hardware upgrades. However, the goal of playing games is not to spend money; it is to have fun. There are numerous free games and affordable options available to cater to this objective. 4. Not earning money: While some professional gamers and streamers earn money from playing computer games, they are not the primary goal of playing games for most users. People play games for enjoyment and relaxation, with earning money being a side-effect or bonus for a few. 5. Not fast: Speed or being fast is not a goal when it comes to playing computer games, although certain games may require quick reflexes or test the player's ability to make fast decisions.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - An academy (Attic Greek: ; Koine Greek ) is an institution of secondary education, higher learning, research, or honorary membership. - Attic Greek is the main Greek dialect that was spoken in ancient Attica, which includes Athens. Of the ancient dialects, it is the most similar to later Greek and is the standard form of the language that is studied in ancient-Greek language courses. Attic Greek is sometimes included in the Ionic dialect. Together, Attic and Ionic are the primary influences on Modern Greek. - The Western world or the West is a term usually referring to different nations, depending on the context, most often including at least part of Europe. There are many accepted definitions about what they all have in common. The Western world is also known as the Occident (from Latin: \\"occidens\\" \\"sunset, West\\", as contrasted with Orient). - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination. - Arabic (' or ' ) is a Central Semitic language that was first spoken in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.7 billion Muslims. It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, and from northwestern Arabia to the Sinai in the south. - Byzantium (\\"Byzántion\\") was an ancient Greek colony on the site that later became Constantinople, and later still Istanbul. Byzantium was colonised by the Greeks from Megara in . - Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period. - Not to be confused with Olympiodorus the Elder Olympiodorus the Younger ( Greek : ; c. 495 -- 570 ) was a Neoplatonist philosopher , astrologer and teacher who lived in the early years of the Byzantine Empire , after Justinian 's Decree of 529 AD which closed Plato 's Academy in Athens and other pagan schools . Olympiodorus was the last pagan to maintain the Platonist tradition in Alexandria ( see Alexandrian School ) ; after his death the School passed into the hands of Christian Aristotelians , and was eventually moved to Constantinople . - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - Biblical Hebrew (\\"Ivrit Miqra'it\\" or \\"Leshon ha-Miqra\\"), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of Hebrew, a Canaanite Semitic language spoken by the Israelites in the area known as Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term \\"Hebrew\\" was not used for the language in the Bible, which was referred to as Canaanite or Judahite, but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century BCE, and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in the siege of Jerusalem (AD 70). - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","response":"The plant runs on a combination of 92 percent bagasse and 8 percent heavy fuel oil. Belcogen is contractually obligated to sell at least 106 Gigawatt-hours (GWh) to BEL for the first year of operation, making the company the source of at least 20 percent of Belize’s national energy demand. Belcogen is a power plant that relies primarily on bagasse, which is a byproduct of sugar production. Bagasse is a fibrous residue left over after the extraction of juice from sugarcane. The use of bagasse as an energy source is quite practical and sustainable, since this material is readily available from sugarcane processing industries. By utilizing 92 percent bagasse in the energy production process, Belcogen not only contributes to a circular economy, but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, as bagasse is a renewable resource. In addition to bagasse, Belcogen utilizes 8 percent heavy fuel oil (HFO) to meet its energy requirements. Heavy fuel oil is a residual fuel obtained from the crude oil refining process. Although HFO is not a renewable source of energy, it is economically viable due to its lower cost as compared to other fossil fuels such as diesel or natural gas. The combination of bagasse and heavy fuel oil allows the plant to achieve the desired efficiency while keeping operational costs down. Belcogen is legally bound to sell a minimum of 106 Gigawatt-hours (GWh) to Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) during the first year of operation. This is an enormous contribution to the national energy supply, accounting for at least 20 percent of Belize's total energy demand. By integrating this significant amount of renewable energy into the country's power grid, Belcogen plays a vital role in increasing the share of renewables within Belize's energy mix, leading to a more sustainable and environmentally responsible energy sector. Moreover, the partnership between Belcogen and BEL is expected to facilitate a smooth transition towards cleaner energy sources and a more innovative approach towards energy production within the country. As the demand for energy continues to grow, it is crucial for countries like Belize to explore alternative and eco-friendly methods of meeting their energy needs, and the joint efforts of Belcogen and BEL seem to be a promising step in this direction. In conclusion, the collaboration between Belcogen and BEL is a significant milestone for the energy sector of Belize. By leveraging the abundant bagasse resources available from sugarcane production, together with heavy fuel oil, Belcogen is capable of supplying a substantial portion of the country's energy needs while reducing the dependency on non-renewable sources. This in turn will contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious energy industry for Belize."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

And the answer is...","response":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like we're talking to a five-year-old. We have the equation: -14 = 3*p + 7. 1. We want to find out what p is, so first, we will get rid of the \\"+ 7\\" on the right side. To do this, we will subtract 7 from both sides of the equation. So, the equation becomes: -14 - 7 = 3*p 2. Now we can calculate -14 - 7 which is -21. So the equation is now: -21 = 3*p 3. We are getting closer! Now we just need to remove the \\"3*\\" from the right side. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 3. So the equation becomes: -21 ÷ 3 = p 4. And finally, we can calculate -21 ÷ 3 which is -7. So, the answer is: p = -7.

Created by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, the show is a fantasy drama that intertwines well-known fairytales and their characters, placing them in the modern world of Storybrooke, Maine. The unique spin on classic fairy tales attracted a wide audience and garnered the show a dedicated fanbase. The series was primarily filmed in and around the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia, Canada. This region is known for its picturesque landscapes, lush forests, and diverse architecture, which beautifully complemented the magical realism of the Once Upon a Time universe. Several specific filming locations contributed to the iconic look and feel of the show. 1. Steveston Village, Richmond: One of the most recognizable filming locations, this charming and historic fishing village served as the backdrop for the fictional town of Storybrooke. Many of the show's iconic locales – such as Granny's Diner, Mr. Gold's Pawn Shop, and Storybrooke Town Hall – can be found in and around the village. The exteriors of these buildings were often shot in Steveston, while interiors were filmed in a studio in Burnaby. 2. Central Park, Burnaby: The beautiful Central Park in Burnaby provided the perfect setting for various scenes that took place in the enchanted forest. Its towering trees, meandering pathways, and serene ponds served as an idyllic backdrop for many of the characters' adventures in the magical realm. 3. Lynn Canyon Park, North Vancouver: Another popular filming location, Lynn Canyon Park, provided the dense, lush forest that is often portrayed in fairy tale settings. The park's suspension bridge, waterfalls, and hiking trails added mystique and grandeur to many scenes throughout the series. 4.

The techniques make farming possible in places where there is not enough water. Because of this, he won this year's World Food Prize. Hillel is using the techniques in his orchards near his home in Israel. Irrigating drop by drop -- called drip irrigation -- has changed agriculture by greatly reducing the amount of water needed. Farmers now rely on it in places from Spain, to Africa, to America. \\"We in California grow about 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables of the continental United States,\\" says Jan Hopmans from University of California at Davis. \\"And these drip irrigation techniques make it possible.\\" Hillel got his start in dry land farming in Israel's Negev Desert in the 1950s. \\"The key was making good use of water,\\" he says. \\"There's much land. Water is limited.\\" These farmers did not have the advantage of running irrigation water through channels to their crops. So Hillel and others gave plants just what they needed and just where they needed it. \\"The idea is to use water little by little,\\" Hillel says. It worked so well that Hillel was soon traveling around the world, showing others how to do it. Experts say drip irrigation's importance is growing, as climate change and rising population make water supplies become few in many parts of the world. \\"This is where water use, climate change and crop production all meet at one point,\\" Hillel says. \\"And this has been really the essence of my career.\\" A career whose importance can be measured drop by drop.

Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General Saw Maung staged a coup d'état and formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. SLORC changed the country's official English name from the \\"Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\\" to the \\"Union of Myanmar\\" in 1989. Why was marshal law declared in Burma in 1989?","response":"Martial law was declared in Burma (now Myanmar) in 1989 due to a combination of factors that threatened the stability and control of the ruling military regime. The government, led by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), was facing widespread protests and unrest in the country, stemming from economic mismanagement, political oppression, and a yearning for greater freedom and democracy among the population. This climate of instability and popular dissent ultimately forced the military government to take drastic measures in order to maintain its grip on power and suppress the growing opposition to its rule. One of the key events that led to the declaration of martial law in 1989 was the 8888 Uprising – so named because it reached its peak on the 8th of August, 1988 (8/8/88). This was a series of nationwide protests and demonstrations that challenged the military's rule and called for the establishment of a democratic government. The protests were primarily driven by students, intellectuals, and Buddhist monks, but they soon garnered support from various segments of Burmese society, including workers, farmers, and even some members of the military. The 8888 Uprising posed a significant threat to the SLORC, as it demonstrated that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the military regime and its policies. In response to the protests, the government used force to crack down on dissent, resulting in the deaths of thousands of demonstrators and the imprisonment of many others. However, these repressive measures were not enough to quell the unrest, and the protests continued to grow in intensity and magnitude. As tensions between the government and the opposition intensified, the situation in Burma reached a boiling point in 1989. The SLORC feared that the continued unrest could lead to a complete loss of control and the possible overthrow of the regime. In order to reassert its authority and maintain control of the country, the military government decided to declare martial law, which granted them greater power to arrest, detain, and punish those who were deemed a threat to state security. Martial law allowed the SLORC to take extraordinary measures to suppress the opposition and curtail civil liberties. Under this state of emergency, the government could bypass the country's existing legal system and implement strict measures to control the population, including curfews, restrictions on movement, pervasive surveillance, and the deployment of large numbers of security forces to quash dissent. Through martial law, the SLORC hoped to regain control of the situation and prevent the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people from threatening the survival of the regime. In summary, martial law was declared in Burma in 1989 in response to the escalating unrest and pro-democracy protests throughout the country, which threatened the stability and control of the military government. By implementing martial law, the SLORC sought to reassert its authority, suppress the opposition, and maintain its grip on power in the face of widespread popular dissent. This decision marked a turning point in Burma's political landscape and set the stage for the continued struggle between the military regime and pro-democracy forces in the years that followed."},{"question":"death could not hold him and as a result, jesus opened up a way back to god—a way on which we who are his disciples can follow him. what a powerful, hopeful gospel we have been given! learn more about overcoming sin.

Most people are familiar with the \\"trophy wife\\" stereotype that attractive women marry rich men, placing little importance on their other traits, including physical appearance, and that men look for pretty wives but don't care about their education or earnings. New research, however, by University of Notre Dame Sociologist Elizabeth McClintock, shows the trophy wife stereotype is largely a myth fueled by selective observation that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivializes women's careers. In \\"Beauty and Status: The Illusion of Exchange in Partner Selection?\\" forthcoming in American Sociological Review, McClintock resolves the paradox between the trophy wife stereotype and the evidence that couples match on both physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status. Using, for the first time, a nationally representative sample of young couples in which both partners were interviewed and rated for physical attractiveness, McClintock was able to control for matching on attractiveness. She says prior research in this area has ignored two important factors. \\"I find that handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women,\\" says McClintock, who specializes in inequality within romantic partnerships. \\"So, on average, high-status men do have better-looking wives, but this is because they themselves are considered better looking--perhaps because they are less likely to be overweight and more likely to afford braces, nice clothes and trips to the dermatologist, etc. Secondly, the strongest force by far in partner selection is similarity -- in education, race, religion and physical attractiveness.\\" McClintock's research shows that there is not, in fact, a general tendency for women to trade beauty for money. That is not to say trophy wife marriages never happen, just that they are very rare. \\"Donald Trump and his third wife Melania Knauss-Trump may very well exemplify the trophy wife stereotype,\\" McClintock says. \\"But, there are many examples of rich men who partner with successful women rather than 'buying' a supermodel wife. The two men who founded Google (Larry Page and Sergey Brin) both married highly accomplished women--one has a PhD and the other is a wealthy entrepreneur.\\" McClintock says the trophy wife stereotype is most often wrongly-applied among non- celebrities. \\"I've heard doctors' wives referred to as trophy wives by observers who only notice her looks and his status and fail to realize that he is good-looking too and that she is also a successful professional--or was before she had kids and left her job,\\" McClintock says. McClintock's research also indicates that, contrary to the trophy wife stereotype, social class barriers in the marriage market are relatively impermeable. Beautiful women are unlikely to leverage their looks to secure upward mobility by marriage. # ||||| Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Trophy wives are a constant source of media and pop-culture fixation, and for understandable reasons: One, they tend to be beautiful, and two, they tend to be hitched to powerful, prominent men. Underlying the concept, of course, is a particularly old-fashioned notion of gender, of who seeks what in a relationship — but one which has been supported by certain empirical literature on relationship and marriage patterns. An important new study argues that this idea, and the research backing it, may be a myth that can be explained by biased misinterpretations of who is pairing with whom, and why. The paper, written by Elizabeth Aura McClintock of Notre Dame and published in American Sociological Review, examined a big data set of heterosexual young-adult couples to better figure out how people choose a mate. McClintock discusses two mechanisms at work that potentially help explain the pairing process: matching and exchange. Matching is the notion that people “select a partner with similar characteristics” to themselves when it comes to education, attractiveness, and other characteristics. Exchange, on the other hand, is the idea of someone trading beauty or status to land a partner who has what they lack. The classic example of this is the trophy wife marrying a rich guy — she has beauty but lacks dough, while he has money but ain’t much to look at, so each partner is trading something for something. McClintock’s argument is that past evidence for so-called “beauty-status exchange” — focusing, naturally, on attractive women settling down with rich men — is built on a misreading of the data. To make a long and somewhat wonky story short, socioeconomic status and beauty are correlated — richer people are more likely to be attractive, and vice-versa (this may be because attractive people are treated better and have an easier time gaining status, because rich people are healthier and can afford better beauty and grooming products, or some combination of these and other factors). This leads to problems when you realize that several of the past studies upon which the idea of beauty-status exchange is built only examined the women’s attractiveness and the men’s status. They ignored how the men looked and the education and/or the status levels of the women. So let’s say you’re a researcher conducting one of these studies, and you notice that lots of high-status men marry beautiful women. Bam — beauty-status exchange. Only, slow down: What if these results can mostly be explained by matching rather than exchange? If people with high levels of status or beauty simply seek out similarly blessed people, that could explain why high-status men (who are more likely to be attractive) often end up with attractive women (who are more likely to be high status). Like is seeking like: It isn’t necessarily the case that much trading is going on. Without data on male attractiveness or female status, you’d miss these potential dynamics entirely, and instead chalk the patterns in the data up to a trophy-wife mechanism. That’s the case McClintock makes, writing that her study is the first of its size and scope to look at both partners’ attractiveness and status. Sure enough, she finds scant evidence for beauty-status exchange — and what little evidence she does find is gender-symmetric, meaning men are just as likely to trade their beauty for a woman’s status as vice-versa, and seems restricted to shorter-term relationships. It’s easy to find oneself flailing about in this methodological morass, but it’s worth understanding what’s going on here. McClintock’s study touches on some extremely important, fundamental questions about how we deal with gender in the social sciences, about how we potentially let our biases creep into the scientific (or “scientific”) method and therefore become legitimatized. No one study can conclusively disprove the idea of beauty-status exchange, but this one certainly puts a sizable dent in it, and it offers a rather compelling-seeming reason as to how so many researchers could have come to believe this idea in the first place. As McClintock puts it: This article … demonstrates how the expectations researchers bring to a topic may bias their findings. Assuming that the importance of beauty and status is gendered may cause researchers to overlook men’s attractiveness and women’s socioeconomic resources and thus to misidentify matching as exchange. Eli Finkel, a psychologist at Northwestern who studies relationships but who wasn’t involved in this study, expanded on this point in an email. “Scientists are humans, too, and we can be inadvertently blinded by their beliefs about how the world works,” he said. “The studies that only looked at men’s (but not women’s) income and only looked at women’s (but not men’s) attractiveness were problematic in that way, as was the peer review process that allowed flawed papers like that to be published. Fortunately, cases like that are the exception rather than the rule, and science tends to do a good job of ferretting them out. That’s what McClintock has done here.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"New research by University of Notre Dame Sociologist Elizabeth McClintock has shown that the \\"trophy wife\\" stereotype is largely a myth, fueled by selective observation that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivializes women's careers. McClintock's research also indicates that social class barriers in the marriage market are relatively impermeable, and beautiful women are unlikely to leverage their looks to secure upward mobility by marriage. The study found scant evidence for beauty-status exchange, and what little evidence was found is gender-symmetric. It highlights the importance of considering biases that may impact research findings and interpretations in the study of gender and relationships."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

It developed in the early 18th century in Paris, France as a reaction against the grandeur, symmetry, and strict regulations of the previous Baroque style, especially of the Palace of Versailles, until it was redone. Rococo artists and architects used a more jocular, florid, and graceful approach to the Baroque. Their style was ornate and used light colours, asymmetrical designs, curves, and gold. Unlike the political Baroque, the Rococo had playful and witty themes. The interior decoration of Rococo rooms was designed as a total work of art with elegant and ornate furniture, small sculptures, ornamental mirrors, and tapestry complementing architecture, reliefs, and wall paintings. - Henri ( de ) Gissey ( ca 1621 -- 1673 ) was a French draughtsman and designer who held the post of dessinateur de la Chambre et du cabinet de Roi in the Menus Plaisirs du Roi in the early years of Louis XIV of France . Jean Bérain the Elder , who succeeded him in the post , is likely to have been in some sense his pupil . Gissey 's appointment made him responsible for the expressions of court style , above all in the elaborately costumed and produced ballets de cour , in which the young king danced among his courtiers ; following Colbert 's remodelling of the royal household , the Cabinet du Roi , to which Gissey was also attached , produced the sumptuous engraved festival books that often followed such events and are sometimes the only surviving record of them . His court position demanded in addition to designs for costumes , designs for other kinds of court ceremonial festivities , carried out under the general direction of Louis Trelons - Cochon Hesselin , \`\` Overseer of the King 's pleasures '' , the part of the royal household -- the Maison du Roi -- in charge of entertainments . Hesselin was a grand collector , patron and amateur of art ; for Hesselin 's own lavish entertainments for the king , Gissey 's office produced the costumes and sets . Several of his pen - and - wash designs for ballets de cour are at the Victoria and Albert Museum . There are several designs for costumes for Louis XIV as Apollo , a role he repeated in numerous court ballets : several are at the Bibliothèque de l'Institut de France . They are reminders of the extent to which the \`\` Sun King '' would identify himself as Apollo through consistent iconography at Versailles and in the sculptural program of its gardens and fountains . Gissey seems to have worked as an engraver as well as a designer . - Since at least the 18th century (in French and German as well as English), grotesque (or grottoesque) has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, fantastic, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as Halloween masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, \\"grotesque\\" may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as sympathetic pity. More specifically, the grotesque forms on Gothic buildings, when not used as drain-spouts, should not be called gargoyles, but rather referred to simply as grotesques, or chimeras. - Saint-Mihiel is a commune in the Meuse department in Grand Est in north-eastern France. - The Bâtiments du Roi (\\"The King's Buildings\\") was a division of Department of the household of the Kings of France (the \\"Maison du Roi\\") in France under the Ancien Régime. It was responsible for building works at the King's residences in and around Paris. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'place of birth' with 'paris'.

In 1993, Michael Jackson was accused of sexually molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler. Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson. Safechuck and Robson allege that Jackson sexually abused them at his home, Neverland Ranch, and at his other residences across California.Reed described his film as a \\"study of the psychology of child sexual abuse, told through two ordinary families who were groomed for 20 years by a paedophile masquerading as a trusted friend\\".","response":"From the article, the full names of the people who testified in defense of Michael Jackson in the past are Wade Robson and James Safechuck.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: The speed of light in a vacuum, denoted as 'c', is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) or roughly 186,282 miles per second (mi/s). According to Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, it establishes the cosmic speed limit for any object or information traveling through space. Einstein's equations demonstrate that as an object accelerates and its velocity approaches the speed of light, its mass increases, and the energy required to accelerate it further also increases. Effectively, the object's mass would become infinite at the speed of light. Consequently, it would require an infinite amount of energy to propel the object to reach or surpass the speed of light, which is practically impossible. Moreover, the theory of special relativity also states that the flow of time for an object moving close to the speed of light slows down relative to a stationary observer. This is called time dilation. If an object were to travel faster than light, it would essentially break the fundamental linear progression of time, leading to numerous paradoxes and inconsistencies with the laws of physics. Thus, based on our current understanding of the laws and principles governing the universe, the answer is no, it is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum."},{"question":"Question: Rose's mom took Rose roller skating one night.

This scratch will cost Kim 500 to fix.","response":"A linguist would indeed find the given sentence to be a valid English sentence, both grammatically and semantically. The sentence has a clear subject, verb, and object, and it conveys its meaning effectively. Let's break down the sentence to understand its grammatical elements: 1. \\"This scratch\\" - This is the subject of the sentence. The phrase \\"this scratch\\" is a noun phrase, serving as the focus of the sentence. \\"This\\" is a demonstrative pronoun that specifies a particular object (in this case, the scratch), and \\"scratch\\" is a singular countable noun referring to the damage on a surface. 2. \\"will cost\\" - This is the verb phrase, indicating the main action and providing a sense of tense. The modal verb \\"will\\" is used to express future predictions, while \\"cost\\" is the main verb that describes the action of having a certain price or expense associated with it. The use of \\"will cost\\" indicates that the cost of fixing the scratch is expected in the future. 3. \\"Kim\\" - This is the indirect object in the sentence, denoting the person who will bear the cost of fixing the scratch. \\"Kim\\" is a proper noun used as an indirect object, representing a specific individual. 4. \\"500\\" - This is a direct object in the sentence and provides important information. The \\"\\" symbol is a currency symbol, and \\"500\\" is a numeral, collectively denoting the amount of money that the action (cost) concerns. 5. \\"to fix\\" - This is an infinitive verb phrase that explains the purpose of the cost incurred. The preposition \\"to\\" is used with the base form of the verb \\"fix,\\" together denoting the intention behind the money spent, which is to repair the scratch. The sentence maintains proper syntax and word order, with the subject (\\"this scratch\\") followed by the verb phrase (\\"will cost\\") and then the indirect object (\\"Kim\\"), ultimately providing specific information and the purpose within the sentence (\\"500 to fix\\"). Therefore, a linguist would confirm that \\"This scratch will cost Kim 500 to fix\\" is indeed a grammatically valid English sentence, as it follows the conventions of standard English grammar and effectively conveys a complete thought with a logical structure."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given news headlines, an edited word and funniness labels.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Now, I have a new situation: Bend city used a lot of fossil fuels to generate electricity. Hop city, another city from the same county, used only alternative sources of energy. Answer this question please: Which city disrupted more ocean food webs? The answer to this question is:","response":"Bend city disrupted more ocean food webs compared to Hop city. To understand the reason behind this, let's first examine the sources of energy each city is using. Bend city is primarily using fossil fuels to generate electricity, while Hop city is using only alternative sources of energy. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, that release large quantities of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, when they are burned for energy production. These emissions contribute to several environmental issues, such as air pollution, global warming, and the depletion of the ozone layer. As previously mentioned, ozone layer depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth, which ultimately leads to the disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, the death of plankton, and the disruption of ocean food webs. On the other hand, alternative sources of energy, such as solar power, wind energy, and hydropower, do not produce significant amounts of greenhouse gases or pollutants that contribute to ozone depletion. Consequently, these sources of energy have a much smaller impact, if any, on ocean food webs compared to fossil fuels. In conclusion, based on the energy sources used by the two cities, Bend city – which predominantly relies on fossil fuels to generate electricity – is the city that disrupted more ocean food webs when compared to Hop city, which only utilizes alternative energy sources. To reduce the negative impacts on the environment and ocean food webs, cities should aim to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner and renewable energy sources."},{"question":"Student: Premise: \\"A clown is applying makeup.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A clown gives a motivational speech.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Firstly, Argentina is known for its rich culture and history. It has been heavily influenced by European culture due to the influx of immigrants from countries like Spain and Italy, and this influence is evident in its art, music, literature, and architecture. One key element of Argentinian culture is the tango. This dance form, characterized by its passionate and dramatic style, originated in the late 19th century in the working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina's vibrant capital city. Argentina is also known for its gastronomy, especially beef. Argentinian grilled meat \\"asado\\" and the iconic \\"empanadas\\" are dishes enjoyed not only locally but globally. The country is one of the world's largest producers of wine, particularly known for its Malbec. In terms of geography, Argentina is renowned for its diverse landscapes. It boasts one of the longest coastlines in the world, with the Atlantic Ocean to the east. And there’s the stunning Andes mountains range to the west, which includes Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas. Furthermore, the country is home to an array of breathtaking natural sites including Iguazú Falls, one of the world’s largest and most spectacular waterfall systems, and the Perito Moreno Glacier, located in the Los Glaciares National Park, both UNESCO World Heritage sites. In sports, Argentina is known for its passion for football (soccer). The country has produced some of the world's best players, including Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. The domestic league and the national team, also known as “La Albiceleste”, inspire fierce loyalty and enthusiasm from fans, and Argentina has won numerous prestigious soccer titles including the FIFA World Cup. While it's interesting to note Argentina's contributions to science and peace, reflected in its Nobel Prize achievements, this fact alone doesn’t provide a comprehensive picture of the rich cultural, geological, historical, and sports-related aspects that Argentina is known for.

Now, let's calculate the number of hot dogs eaten by the 2nd and then the 3rd competitor: 2nd competitor: Since they ate twice the amount of the 1st competitor, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of hot dogs eaten by the 1st competitor by 2. 12 hot dogs * 2 = 24 hot dogs 3rd competitor: They ate 25% less than the 2nd competitor. First, we need to find what 25% of the number of hot dogs eaten by the 2nd competitor is, and then subtract that number from the total hot dogs eaten by the 2nd competitor. 25% of 24 hot dogs = (25/100) * 24 = 6 hot dogs Now, subtract this number from the total hot dogs eaten by the 2nd competitor: 24 hot dogs - 6 hot dogs = 18 hot dogs The 3rd competitor ate 18 hot dogs."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Article: Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around but we can't detect them or sense them without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs. Even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. A child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Question: Which of the following can be best inferred from the passage?

D: Radiation can hurt those who do know about its danger.","response":"A: The importance of protection from radiation cannot be overemphasized."},{"question":"Information: - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\". - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Marcin \`\` Novy '' Nowak ( born October 17 , 1975 ) is a Polish death metal musician known for his contribution to the bands Devilyn , Dies Irae , Nader Sadek , Thy Disease , Behemoth , Spinal Cord , Vader , Virgin Snatch and Crucified Mortals .

Other times, you might find it more beneficial to install it at night, when few others are around to interfere. Yarn bombing during the day will likely make it impossible to remain anonymous, but if secrecy is not important to you, the daylight will make it much easier to see. If you want to remain anonymous, you will need to pick a time of day when very few people are likely to be around. Usually, this means installing the yarn bomb at night. Aside from your yarn artwork and installation tools, you may also need to bring a few helpers with you. You will need to bring a yarn needle, matching yarn, and scissors to actually install a crocheted or knitted piece. If you are latch hooking or cross stitching, bring the tools you would usually use to create a piece of this nature. Take your diagram, as well, so that you can check your work against it as you move through the installation. You should also bring along a ladder if you need to reach tall places and a flashlight if you are working at night. Even if you think you can install the yarn bomb on your own, it is a wise idea to bring at least one friend with you if you are doing the work in the evening or at night. Use your diagram as a guide as you wrap each piece of yarn artwork around the appropriate part of the object. Hold each piece in place with safety pins until all of the pieces are in their correct position. If you are cross stitching, latch hooking, or wrapping, you won't have any previously created pieces to wrap around the work. Instead, you will need to use the object itself as your canvas and create the entire work on scene. Use additional yarn and a large yarn needle to stitch all the seams together, holding the yarn bomb in place more securely. Once everything is in place, you can remove the safety pins previously responsible for holding the pieces together. Use a simple stitch to make the process as easy and quick as possible. For instance, a whip stitch is usually a good choice. It is crucial that you do not cause any damage to anyone's property while installing your yarn bomb. Aside from man-made property, like benches and signs, you should also avoid damaging the plants and animals living in the area.","response":"Yarn bombing is like creating art with yarn and putting it around things outside, like trees or benches.

However, the heaviest snowfalls have been reported in the mountains of other areas during winter. Snow is even known to fall near the Equator ,but only on the highest mountains. Snow contains much less water than rain, but much of the water the world uses comes from snow. Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power stations and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to seventy-five percent of all surface water supplies. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals . Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is limited. Snow also influences the movement of sound waves. The surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. As snow grows older or if there have been strong winds, it can become hard and flat. Then, the snow,s surface will help to send back sound waves. Snow may be beautiful, but it can be deadly. It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads covered with snow and ice or from being seriously stuck in the winter storm. Others die from heart attacks caused by too much physical activity out in the cold. People may not be able to avoid living in areas where it snows often. However, they can avoid becoming victims of snowstorms. People should stop driving and stay at home until the storm has passed. People living in these areas should carry emergency supplies in their vehicle. These include food,emergency medical supplies,and extra clothing to stay warm and dry. Mountain snowfall _ .

When there is more fluid in a tube the pressure in the tube increases or decreases? The answer is:","response":"The answer is: the pressure in the tube increases. Step-by-step logic: 1. Initially, we establish the fact that if blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. This implies a direct correlation between volume and pressure. 2. Applying this concept to the tube scenario, we would assume that the fluid in the tube represents the 'blood volume' in the initial statement, and the pressure in the tube stands for 'blood pressure'. 3. Therefore, going by the first statement, if the volume (in this case, the amount of fluid in the tube) increases, the pressure (in this case, the pressure in the tube) should also increase. 4. Therefore, the answer is that when there is more fluid in a tube, the pressure in the tube increases. This is a basic idea common in areas such as fluid dynamics and health sciences, and it is partially rooted in Boyle's law from physics which states that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship when temperature is held constant. However, in real life situations, these principles may not always directly apply due to various other influencing factors."},{"question":"If \\"Three children play with a volleyball in shallow water while an adult in a red cap and neon green shirt observes.\\", does this mean that \\"There are four people outdoors by a body of water.\\"?","response":"Step 1: Identify the number of people mentioned in the sentence.

Since the children are playing in shallow water and the adult is observing them, it is reasonable to assume that they are outdoors. It is unlikely for such activities to be held indoors. Conclusion: Based on the steps above, I can confirm that the provided statement, \\"There are four people outdoors by a body of water,\\" accurately represents the information conveyed in the initial sentence."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What South Korean K-pop group has 13 members and their own online TV program?

They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP. In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file. Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released Gorgeous, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro.

Then they visited the Great Wall and took lots of photos. Four hours later it began to rain. They had to go back to the hotel. After getting to the hotel, they found their camera was lost. Mr Green's kids felt sorry and they didn't want to eat anything for dinner. Mr Green told a joke to make them happy. \\"An old man lived in a tall building. It had sixty _ . One day he fell down from it, but he didn't hurt himself,\\" Mr Green said. \\"Do you know why?\\" The kids were surprised and they didn't know the answer. \\"Because he lived on the first floor.\\" The kids all laughed after hearing the answer.

In this case, it's asking if the person who was viewed and subsequently blocked can still see that their profile was viewed.

If you're looking for a \\"jump scare\\" — that quick jolt of fear that you get when something suddenly surprises you — there's probably no quicker way to get it than this. Shocking \\"popup\\" and \\"screamer\\" videos came to popularity in the early days of the internet and have been a staple online prank ever since. Usually, these videos show a simple, pleasant scene or animation to lull you into a false sense of security, then have a horrifying image suddenly appear, accompanied by loud noise. It's cheap, but effective, and if you've never seen a jump scare video before, it's almost impossible to not be scared by one. Ready to be scared? Here's a short list of videos to watch — some have jump scares and some don't. Click at your own risk! For best results, watch alone in the dark with headphones in full-screen mode. Video 1 Video 2 Video 3 Video 4 Video 5 Video 6 Good scary movies pack a lifetime's worth of scares into two hours or less. Want a fun, scary way to spend the evening? Invite a few friends over for a movie night and watch a scary movie no one has seen before — if you're lucky, you may experience dozens of excellent jump scares in a single night! Here is a brief list of horror movies that contain at least one truly shocking jump scare — many contain more. Insidious The Descent The Ring The Exorcist III The Thing Audition Mulholland Drive (this is not a horror movie but contains a single profoundly scary jump scare early in the film) While it may once have seemed unlikely that video games could ever compete with horror movies, some games today are seriously scary. Even more so than with scary movies, scary video games allow you to personally experience the events happening on screen — since you have some control over the events of the game, you're naturally invested in what's happening (and, thus, you're extra-vulnerable to getting scared!) Some games that are considered to be among the scariest of all time are listed below (there are many more): Slender (Windows, Mac) (Free to download) Amnesia: The Dark Descent (Windows, Mac, Linux) Most games in the Silent Hill series (many platforms — consult the wiki for more information) Five Nights at Freddy's and its sequels Five Nights at Freddy's 2,3,4, and Sister Location (Windows and mobile) Condemned: Criminal Origins (Xbox 360 and Windows) Is it late September or October? If so, there may be chance that there are one or more haunted houses open around you. Haunted houses can be great fun with friends or significant others (they can even make great dates if your sweetheart has the right temperament.) If you're truly brave, consider going through on your own, but be ready to be scared witless — many haunted house owners take great pride in their ability to shock visitors in new, inventive ways. If you do go to a haunted house, be sure to use proper etiquette even as you're being scared. Luckily, this is mostly common sense: don't touch the actors, don't try to ruin scares before they happen, and so on. See our article How to Avoid Ticking Off the Actors in a Haunted House for more information. If you're willing to put your jump scare in someone else's hands, consider enlisting the help of a trusted friend. Tell your friend that you want to be scared sometime in the next few days and that you don't want to see it coming, then simply go about your life. Beware — assuming your friend remembers to uphold his or her part of the bargain, a nasty scare will be waiting for you just around the corner in the near future! Some people enjoy the thrill of being scared so much that they'll actually deliberately seek out things that make them feel like they're in danger but are actually safe. Sound ridiculous? If you've ever gone on a roller coaster, you've done the same thing! Below are just a few ideas for perfectly safe activities that may make you feel like you're in mortal peril: Going on a roller coaster or amusement park ride. Standing next to the railing on the observation deck of a tall building. Rock climbing (indoor; with a harness) See a thrilling IMAX movie Going in a full-body computer flight simulator (these are often at science centers, museums, and other educational facilities) Phobias are intense, irrational fears that are centered around certain specific things or activities. Almost everyone has something that seems to freak them out more than it freaks out others, but about four to five percent of the population have clinical (medically significant) phobias. If you have a mild phobia (but not a severe one), consider exposing yourself to the thing you dread to give yourself a quick jolt of adrenaline. Only do this if you have no previous history of experiencing fainting or anxiety attacks from your phobia. Unsure whether or not you have a phobia? The most common phobias are arachnophobia (a fear of spiders), ophidiophobia (a fear of snakes), acrophobia (a fear of heights), necrophobia (a fear of dead things), cynophobia (a fear of dogs), and claustrophobia (a fear of tight spaces). If any of these make you feel a deep dread, you may have a phobia. Note that, unlike all of the other activities in this section, this one has a small (but real) risk of causing lasting distress. People with severe phobias may be paralyzed with traumatizing fear if they attempt to confront their phobia head-on. In this case, the phobia is an issue to seek psychological help for — not something to use for a cheap thrill. See our \\"overcoming phobias\\" article for more information.

We're consumed with sporting class: who has it, who doesn't have it, the right way to win and the wrong way to win. The latest \\"classless\\" wonder is Richard Sherman, a Stanford-educated cornerback who decided to use his postgame interview on FOX as an audition for the WWE. Sherman was brash, opinionated, angry, spiteful and full of histrionic aggression. In other words, he was an entertainer. Who, mercifully, did not suggest that Jesus was behind his accomplishments -- a sentiment that, if shared, would have stamped him as \\"classy.\\" In order to be classy, you have to be humble, genuflect at the altar of the meek. Essentially, you have to be the exact opposite of what's actually required to succeed at your chosen profession. We want athletes, entertainers and anyone else in the public eye to be \\"real,\\" but what we really mean is we want them to all act the exact same. We want them to utter the same banal cliches, put on a false face for television, talk as, simultaneously, everyone and no one actually does in real life. You ever wonder why 99 percent of athlete interviews sound the exact same? It's because everyone is acting, playing the role that countless athletes before them have played in their postgame interviews. It's been so long since someone was actually honest that none of us even knows what that looks like. And if you don't act that way -- a patently false way that no one truly resembles in actual life -- then you're classless. Personally, I wish Sherman had said with a straight face, \\"God really hates the 49ers. I can't believe He picked us over them, but I'm glad He did.\\" That's what I would say if I were interviewed in the postgame scrum. \\"I'm really excited to be going to the Super Bowl, I just wish God didn't hate (insert the team we just beat) so bad.\\" Then, I'd smile, wink and go celebrate. I'd revel in the uproar, delight in the anger. Mostly, though, I'd just enjoy flipping the cliche on its head, doing something different. The reaction to Sherman's interview, which you can watch here, was instantaneous on Twitter. Some loved it, some hated it, but millions took to social media to use it as the latest reflection of modern-American class. How could a football player behave this way? After all, football players -- grown men who make a handsome living trying to knock each other senseless for 60 minutes -- should know better than to comport themselves in such a manner. Oh, won't someone please think of their monocles and canes! Who will protect our children!? According to many, Sherman was -- wait for it -- \\"classless.\\" Or, if you aren't smart enough to spell \\"classless,\\" as many of Sherman's critics were not, then he was \\"not classy.\\" If you're ever bored one day, do a Twitter search for the terms \\"classy,\\" \\"classless\\" or \\"not classy.\\" Plug in any famous person in America and the words \\"classy,\\" \\"classless\\" or \\"not classy,\\" and you'll be stunned by how much reaction there is. Want to know why every celebrity in American life has the depth of a cardboard cutout? Focusing on how classy they are based on a two-minute interaction is a good place to start. Want to know why we're constantly surprised when these celebrities reveal themselves to be different from how they seemed in their \\"classy\\" interviews? Dive in to the real-time Twitter stream. Here's classy on Twitter right now. Every few seconds a new list of comments pops up, discussing what is or is not classy. This happens all day, every day, throughout the end of times. If nuclear war happened tomorrow and most of us were eliminated from the face of the Earth, when the American survivalists climbed out from their bunkers, the first thing they'd say would be, \\"That was not a classy way to have a nuclear war.\\" If the rapture actually happened, those left behind would survey their surroundings and take to Twitter: \\"I thought God was classier than this. To just snatch people up in the middle of the day? Not classy. #godsnotclassy\\" Being classy is a national fixation in all walks of life; sports just reflects this obsession. Of course, the class we focus on is the trivial, inconsequential kind. We avoid discussions of economic class or racial class or class that actually determines whether many of us have equal shots at making it in America today. Nope, those are difficult issues, ones that can't be analyzed immediately. Instead we focus on the low-hanging fruit, the easy target. And one of the great flaws of the social media era is its tendency to create tens of millions of pearl-clutching reactionaries and then give them a voice, leading to a cabal of caterwauling old maids. Somewhere along the way, \\"If you don't like it, don't watch it\\" has been turned into, \\"If I don't like it, you shouldn't be able to watch it, either.\\" Why shouldn't you be able to watch it? An obsession with class, above all else, reflects a society with plenty of time on its hands and nothing that consequential to worry about. There was a reason British aristocrats spent so much time focusing on class and comportment -- because they had nothing else to do. \\"Can you believe these colonies and their Declaration of Independence? Who do those classless colonists think they are?\\" Present-day America has reached that point as well: Let's focus on class. You know what else the British thought wasn't classy back in the day? I'm glad Twitter doesn't decide its fate. What was this article about?","response":"This article discusses the American obsession with 'class' in sports, specifically focusing on the reaction to Richard Sherman, a Seattle Seahawks cornerback. Sherman gave a postgame interview that was considered brash, opinionated, and aggressive, which led to a massive debate on social media platforms about whether his behavior was \\"classy\\" or \\"classless.\\" The author argues that this fixation on class in sports and other aspects of life reflects a society that is too focused on trivial matters and avoids discussing more substantial issues like economic class or racial inequalities."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: Who does Marge re-question at the car dealership?

Movie title: Fargo Context: In the winter of 1987, Minneapolis car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) is desperate for money; repayment is due on a large GMAC loan that he fraudulently collateralized with nonexistent dealership vehicles. Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them. Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal; when Gustafson agrees to front the money, Jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean in Minneapolis as planned. While transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd, Minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. After Carl tries and fails to bribe the trooper, Gaear kills him. When two passing eyewitnesses spot Carl disposing of the body, Gaear kills them as well. The following morning, Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand), who is seven months pregnant, initiates a homicide investigation.

The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the (fictional) Los Angeles International Speedway in California. Lightning is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team.

Napoleon Hill wrote, \\"whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.\\" A young man asked Socrates the secrets to success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning. When they meet, Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river. When the water got up to their necks, Socrates took the young man by surprise and pressed him into the water. The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy stared turning blue. Socrates pulled his head out of the water and the first thing the young man did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, \\"What did you want the most when you were there?\\" the boy replied. \\"Air.\\" Socrates said,\\" That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it. There is no other secret.\\" A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment .

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"If we consider the first sentence to be true, then it can be assumed that the situation being described is quite wild and has Dudley Moore as its narrator. In other words, the first sentence states that Dudley Moore is responsible for narrating the events. Now, if we examine the second sentence, it directly contradicts the first by claiming that Dudley Moore did not narrate the situation. These two sentences are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of them is true, then the other cannot be true. Therefore, if the first sentence is considered true, the second sentence cannot be true, as it directly contradicts the information provided in the first sentence. However, it's important to note that the sentences are independent of each other and could represent different contexts or situations. In such a case, it's possible that both sentences are true within their respective contexts, but contradict each other when taken together. In conclusion, if we accept the first sentence to be true, then we must consider the second sentence to be false, given that they are in the same context. If they refer to different situations, then it's possible for both sentences to be true within their respective contexts."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the bio below and try to give details on karni liddell 's: - birth place - birth date Bio: karni liddell -lrb- born 1 march 1979 -rrb- is a paralympic swimming competitor from australia .

A: A:","response":"A: In many biomes, even dominant plants depend on various types of disturbances to maintain their ecological balance and ensure their survival. These disturbances can be natural or human-induced events that create a change in the structure, composition or functioning of the ecosystem. The type of disturbance that dominant plants depend on varies across different biomes, but they generally help in creating opportunities for regeneration, promoting growth and allowing the plants to adapt to new conditions. Some examples of such disturbances include fire, flooding, storm events, insect infestations, grazing, or even human activities such as logging and agriculture. Fires are a common disturbance in some forest ecosystems and savannas, helping in the recycling of nutrients and allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor for the growth of new plants. Some plants have even evolved with specific adaptations to withstand fire, enabling them to colonize recently burned areas, such as the fire-adapted serotinous cones in some pine species which open after a fire, allowing the seeds to disperse and germinate. Flooding is another type of disturbance that can create suitable conditions for the growth and regeneration of dominant plants in certain biomes, such as wetlands and floodplain forests. These floods can rejuvenate soil nutrients, transport seeds, and create new habitats by depositing sediments. Storm events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, can cause widespread damage to vegetation, creating gaps in the canopy and opening up space for new plants to take advantage of available light and resources. This type of disturbance can help maintain the species diversity and structural complexity of the ecosystem, allowing dominant plants to continue their growth and establishment. Insect infestations can have both destructive and regenerative impacts on ecosystems. In some cases, they can contribute to the death and decay of vegetation, creating opportunities for other species to colonize. In other cases, they may facilitate the growth of certain species by altering the competitive dynamics among the plants, enabling the dominant plants to establish more effectively. Grazing by herbivores can also create disturbances in grassland ecosystems, contributing to the maintenance of plant diversity and productivity. By consuming dominant plants, these grazers can help prevent the formation of monocultures, allowing a mix of species with different growth forms and strategies to persist. Human activities, such as logging or agriculture, can also create disturbances, albeit unintentionally. While these practices can lead to the degradation of some ecosystems, they can also create openings and opportunities for regeneration in others. For instance, some forests can regenerate and recover following selective logging, while fallow agricultural lands might provide suitable conditions for the re-establishment of certain plants. In conclusion, even dominant plants in many biomes depend on various types of disturbances to maintain their ecological balance, adapt to new conditions, and promote growth and regeneration. These disturbances can be natural or human-induced and are integral to the long-term viability and resilience of these ecosystems."},{"question":"Industry giants are giving Howard University 70.6 million in technology to help the school #39;s engineering and science programs.

The cat knocked over the bottle and polish went everywhere. Sue tried to clean it up. However, she could not get the spot clean. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? If her cat wasn't running around Sue never would've knocked over the bottle.","response":"In the given paragraph, we can gather the following information: 1. Sue bought a new bottle of pink nail polish. 2. While she was painting her nails, her cat ran through. 3. The cat knocked over the bottle, causing the polish to spill everywhere. 4. Sue tried to clean up the mess but could not get the spot completely clean. Based on the information provided, the statement \\"If her cat wasn't running around Sue never would've knocked over the bottle\\" appears to be true. It is clear that the cat's action of running through led to the bottle being knocked over and the subsequent spill of the nail polish. Therefore, we could reasonably conclude that if the cat had not been running around, it would not have knocked over the bottle, and Sue might have been able to continue painting her nails without incident. However, it is important to acknowledge that this statement is only true based on the information given in the paragraph. It does not account for any other potential reasons that could have caused the bottle to fall and spill, such as clumsy handling by Sue or an external force like an earthquake or a strong breeze.

The stays came from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Georgia Court of Appeals. \\"I think we were within about a half hour of the execution,\\" said Brian Kammer, an attorney for Hill, whose supporters say is mentally disabled. The Georgia Court of Appeals acted on a appeal of a challenge to the way the prison handles the lethal injection drugs used in executions, while the federal appeals court issued a stay \\"ordering a further briefing on the issue of mental retardation,\\" Kammer said. Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay of execution, as did the state Supreme Court, while the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles similarly denied a request for clemency. Listen: Asking for mercy in the end. The execution had been scheduled for 7 p.m. ET at a state prison in Jackson, about 45 miles south of Atlanta. Hill was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of Joseph Handspike, another inmate in a Georgia state prison. He was convicted of beating Handspike to death with a nail-studded board while serving a life sentence in the 1985 killing of his girlfriend, Myra Wright. His lawyers have argued that Hill's IQ of 70 means he should be spared under a 2002 decision that barred the execution of the mentally disabled. But a string of state courts has said Hill doesn't qualify under Georgia law, which requires inmates to prove mental impairment \\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" \\"This is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation. Even Warren Hill, a man with an IQ of 70 who is diagnosed as mentally retarded by every doctor who has examined him, found it impossible to meet this standard of proof,\\" Kammer said. Handspike's family has called for the execution to be called off. The Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities also weighed in against the execution, stating, \\"No other state risks the lives of those with developmental disabilities to this extreme.\\" Three doctors who examined Hill for the state \\"have now revised their opinions and find that Mr. Hill does meet the criteria for mental retardation,\\" his lawyers argued in court papers. But lawyers for the state have said that Hill served in the Navy, held a job and managed his money before Wright's killing -- signs that he didn't necessarily meet the legal standard for retardation, even though he has a low IQ. Hill had previously been scheduled for execution in July, but the state Supreme Court halted the execution on procedural grounds. Georgia has executed 52 men since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1973, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections. There are currently 94 men and one woman under death sentence in the state. CNN's Dana Ford, Bill Mears and Dave Alsup contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","response":"1.

Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

The pilot of Air Force One has revealed for the first time how they feared the presidential jet would be rammed by hijacked jet in the hours after the 9/11 terror attack. Colonel Mark Tillman said he and his crew received a radio message saying 'Angel is next' as America reeled from the attack on the twin towers. Angel was the secret call sign for Air Force One as it left Sarasota, Florida, where President Bush had been told about the attacks on the Twin Towers. Warning: Colonel Mark Tillman said he and his crew received a radio message saying 'Angel is next' Under threat: President Bush and staffers look out at fighter jets accompanying Air Force One en route from Sarasota, Florida, to Shreveport, Louisiana. Tillman revealed air traffic controllers also gave them an ominous warning that another passenger jet was close to them that was not responding to calls. 'As we got over Gainesville, Fla., we got the word from Jacksonville Center. They said, \\"Air Force One you have traffic behind you and basically above you that is descending into you, we are not in contact with them - they have shut their responder off\\". 'And at that time it kind of led us to believe maybe someone was coming into us in Sarasota, they saw us take off, they just stayed high and are following us at this point. 'We had no idea what the capabilities of the terrorist were at that point.' Tillman said he flew the specially adapted Boeing 747 out into the Gulf of Mexico to see if the other plane would follow. Safe: President Bush walks down the steps of Air Force One as he arrives at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on 9/11. Concern: President Bush speaks to vice president Dick Cheney by phone aboard Air Force One on September 11. When the other jet continued on its route he was later told it was an airliner that had lost its transponder -which sends out an electronic identification signal - and the pilots had failed to switch to a new radio frequency. Tillman said the threat remained and he received the message:'We got word from the vice president and the staff that 'Angel was next,' Angel being the classified call sign of Air Force One.' 'Once we got into the Gulf and they passed to us that 'Angel was next,' at that point I asked for fighter support. If an airliner was part of the attack, it would be good to have fighters on the wing to go ahead and take care of us.' The senior pilot said President Bush's plans to fly to Washington DC were scrapped and he landed at air force bases in Louisiana and Nebraska from where the president addressed the nation. Tillman said he was fearful Air Force One would be attacked when he brought the plane back to Andrews Air Force base in Washington DC. Message: President Bush is told news of the 9/11 terror attacks. Escort: A F-16 fighter flies just off the wing of the presidential aircraft Air Force One on a flight back to Washington on 9/11. 'All along, everybody knew I was bringing him home, so my fear was they've done all of this, they know Air Force One is eventually going to come back to Washington, D.C.; they are sitting there, they're waiting for us,' he said. Tillman, who now flies a corporate jet after retiring from his duties with Air Force One in 2009, said he fears terrorists will launch another attack. He told Fox News:'I'm a strong believer that there will be other attacks. 'They caught us with our pants down, they attacked our country, they attacked from within... You got to assume right now that they're going to go ahead and infiltrate us and they're going to go ahead, take advantage of everything we offer to them.' He added:'I think President Bush did a great job making sure the American people realize our safety is important, but we've got to go ahead and protect each and every one of us, take care of each other and change the way we do business so the terrorists won't take advantage of us anymore.'

Technical analysis can seem silly for many people until you truly get it. This book demystifies things a bit. One definite drawback though is the editing is quite poor. There are numerous mistakes referencing wrong prices, and charts which sometimes made me wonder if I was looking at what the author was writing about. If not for that issue I may have given it 5 stars as the book is what is says it is and does it quite well. Answer: Possible answers: + No; + Yes; The answer is:","response":"Yes, this product review is overall positive. The reviewer shares that they have read a decent amount of books and articles on technical strategies and found this particular book clearer and easier to understand than most. The review states that the book demystifies technical analysis, which can seem silly to many people until they truly understand it. However, the reviewer points out a drawback in the book - poor editing. They mention numerous mistakes referencing wrong prices and charts, which made them doubt if they were looking at what the author intended. Despite this issue, the reviewer acknowledges that the book is what it claims to be and does its job quite well. Although the review has a minor negative point, the overall tone is positive, as it praises the book's clarity and ability to demystify technical analysis. Therefore, we can conclude that this product review is positive."},{"question":"BH'de Komsiç partisinden istifa etti Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Step 1: Identify the language of the source text.

I have brought visiting family members here for everything from t-shirts to expensive jewelry items. The staff is helpful and friendly. The owner, \\"Hong\\", however - is not. She has a major attitude and has been rude and insulting on more than one occasion. I have had her follow me around like a suspected shoplifter when needing to try on a \\"Double D Ranchwear\\" t-shirt. It isn't my fault the only dressing room is in another area of the store, and \\"Lucita\\" already knew who I was/what I was trying on. Further, if a store owner is following a customer - the proper approach is to offer service: \\"How are you doing? Can I get you a different style or size?\\" Hong does not offer service if her subordinates are present. Hong has also insulted the jewelry I was wearing at the time - a 500 item. Her insult was in response to the fact I asked the source of the turquoise on an item in her case. My grandfather was Native American and I have an extensive collection and have worked with turquoise, so I do know the characteristics between the turquoise produced by the domestic mines and how it differs from Mexican and Chinese turquoise. I have truly made an effort to practice more graciousness than she clearly possesses by NOT observing that I could easily identify types of turquoise decades before she married into the Bischoff family. Further, I have heard her misrepresent some of her products to tourists. (Native Americans will usually identify their jewelry by the terms \\"Native American\\", \\"Zuni\\", \\"Navajo,\\" etc - not \\"Indian Made.\\") Further, a majority of her earrings - particularly the Repousse- can be found on eBay.....identical product - 60% less. If one purchases here, I would definitely ask for proof of authenticity. (and they do have some real works of art, but their inventory is a mix). There's another issue: pricing. She clearly counts on the naive \\"one-purchase tourists\\" as her priority clients, because she has clothing hanging in her (unbelievably disorganized) clothing area that is nearly 3 years old (2012 Double D Ranchwear t-shirt, \\"The Wild Ones\\" for example). So, from a local who shopped often at this store: I've decided that I can find any of these items elsewhere at any number of businesses that value my patronage. And my sincere apologies to the friendly and helpful staff that have to work under her. It's taken me a long time to write this review, and I kept going back and just avoiding her. In that time, I've discovered her attitude is already widely known around town. Choose the sentiment of this review? Available options: i. negative. ii. positive.","response":"i. negative. This review is decidedly negative. While at first it seems like it might be positive because the writer describes shopping at the store for many years and highlights some of the products they've bought, it quickly descends into a litany of complaints. The reviewer has major issues with the owner's demeanour and the way she interacts with customers, feeling like she was treated like a suspect and insulted, and criticizes the quality and authenticity of some items. The reviewer also accuses the owner of preying on naive tourists and keeping old stock, while also treating her workers poorly. They even state they've decided to take their business elsewhere where it'll be valued, which indicates dissatisfaction with the overall service at the store. The mention of friendly and helpful staff isn't enough to tilt the overall sentiment of the review towards positive. This is because the positive remarks are not only few, but they are also vastly outweighed by the multiple negative statements about the owner's behaviour, identification authenticity of products, pricing methods, and shop organization.

Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language. Commonly cited examples include Ainu, Basque, Korean and Sumerian, though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages. - Sumerian (\\"native tongue\\") is the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate which was spoken in southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a \\"Sprachbund\\" (area of linguistic convergence). - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - Sumer was the first urban civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq, during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze ages, and arguably the first civilization in the world with Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, Sumerian farmers were able to grow an abundance of grain and other crops, the surplus of which enabled them to settle in one place. - Sumerian literature is the literature written in the Sumerian language during the Middle Bronze Age . Most Sumerian literature is preserved indirectly , via Assyrian or Babylonian copies . The Sumerians invented the first writing system , developing Sumerian cuneiform writing out of earlier proto - writing systems by about the 30th century BC. The earliest literary texts appear from about the 27th century BC. The Sumerian language remained in official and literary use in the Akkadian and Babylonian empires , even after the spoken language disappeared from the population ; literacy was widespread , and the Sumerian texts that students copied heavily influenced later Babylonian literature . - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - Babylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of Babylon. Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called \\"Mt Akkad\\" \\"the country of Akkad\\" in the Akkadian language. It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792 1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696 1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi. - A sprachbund (\\"federation of languages\\") also known as a linguistic area, area of linguistic convergence, diffusion area or language crossroads is a group of languages that have common features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact. They may be genetically unrelated, or only distantly related. Where genetic affiliations are unclear, the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness. Areal features are common features of a group of languages in a sprachbund. - In anthropology and geography, a cultural region, cultural sphere, cultural area or culture area refers to a geographical area with one relatively homogeneous human activity or complex of activities (culture).

The San Francisco coroner’s report showed that Mario Woods, 26, also had drugs in his system when he died in the shooting that sparked protests and calls for the police chief’s removal. Woods had two gunshot wounds in his buttocks and others to his head, legs, abdomen and hands. Some of the wounds could have been from the same bullet, the autopsy said. It also showed that Woods had used methamphetamine, marijuana, antidepressants and cough medicine before he was shot. Investigators have said five officers opened fire on the knife-wielding Woods on 2 December and that 27 shell casings were recovered at the scene where he died. Police had encountered him while searching for an assailant who stabbed a stranger earlier in the day. Police say Woods ignored commands to drop the knife and resisted even after he was shot several times by a “bean-bag” gun and pepper-sprayed. The shooting was captured on video and circulated widely online, igniting ongoing protests over police tactics. A group of Beyoncé’s backup dancers created a political firestorm when they were photographed at the Super Bowl last weekend, dressed in Black Panther-inspired costumes, holding a sign that read “Justice 4 Mario Woods”. The department, district attorney and police commission have each launched an investigation. “It is difficult for anyone to watch videos of the shooting. Similarly, it is equally as difficult to read the medical examiner’s report,” the San Francisco police department said in a prepared statement. It said the agency was “committed to a thorough review of the shooting, and this report will be an important component of all three ongoing independent investigations”. Chief Greg Suhr says he will not resign as a result of the shooting, and Mayor Ed Lee says he will not fire him. Suhr and the mayor called on the US Department of Justice to review department policy and procedures and advise the city on reforms. The DoJ said last week it would conduct the review. Woods’s family has filed a legal claim against the police and the city, arguing that officers did not have to open fire. The family’s attorney, John Burris, told the Guardian that the autopsy report confirmed his view that the shooting was unlawful, comparing it to the Chicago police killing of Laquan McDonald. “It’s unconscionable that a person can be shot that many times in the back,” Burris said. “When you shoot someone in the back, that means he’s not threatening you.” Write a title for it.","response":"\\"Autopsy Report Reveals Young Black Man Killed by San Francisco Police Suffered 20 Gunshot Wounds, Sparking Protests and Calls for Police Chief's Removal\\""},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale about a pair of enchanted crimson ballet slippers, 'The Red Shoes' follows the beautiful Vicky Page (Moira Shearer), a young socialite who loves ballet, the rising composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) whom she loves, and her dictatorial director, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook).After attracting the attention of the famous Director, and earning respect and admiration from her colleagues, Vicky is promised by Lermontov that- ''You shall dance, and the world shall follow'' -but only on the agreement that she will dance, and he will control everything else.On this basis, Vicky rises to fame as the prima ballerina in a world- class Ballet Company.

We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs.

Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence? The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","response":"Group L had more changes in their RNA sequence. According to the paragraph, Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.

Which friend received fewer antiretroviral drugs? Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. A:","response":"Manny received fewer antiretroviral drugs. In the provided paragraph, it is mentioned that Nigel was infected with the HIV virus, and Manny contracted a bacterial infection. Antiretroviral drugs, as described in the paragraph, are specifically developed to treat viral diseases, and their development has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Since HIV is a virus and Nigel is the one infected with it, he would be the one receiving antiretroviral drugs as part of his treatment. On the other hand, Manny's infection is bacterial, and the treatment for such infections involves antibiotics rather than antiviral or antiretroviral drugs.

Context: There is an enormous amount of work that goes on in committees when members put aside some of their partisanship and focus on how to build an excellent health care system, on how to build a good research and development program and how to deal with issues of equity when you are looking at issues of debt reduction. Hypothesis: Committees do very little work. OPT: [i] Yes. [ii] It's impossible to say. [iii] No.","response":"[iii] No. From the given context, we can draw the hypothesis that committees are indeed involved in a significant amount of work. The context highlights various aspects where committee members put in efforts to address important tasks. There is mention of putting aside partisanship to focus on essential issues such as building an excellent health care system, developing a strong research and development program, and dealing with equity issues relating to debt reduction. These tasks require careful thought, evaluation, and collaboration, which in turn implies substantial work being conducted by these committees. Furthermore, the context uses the phrase \\"enormous amount of work\\" to describe the efforts of committee members. This statement counters the hypothesis that committees do very little work. Instead, it supports the notion that committees are actively engaged in handling complex issues and are putting in considerable work to find solutions and make improvements in the mentioned areas."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I spotted (;) him at the checkout counter, bagging at No.14.

OPT: *unacceptable. *acceptable....I think the answer is","response":"*unacceptable. A linguist would rate this sentence to be unacceptable linguistically, due to the ambiguity and improper use of prepositions, which make the meaning unclear. Let's break down the issues with the sentence to understand why it is considered unacceptable. 1. Ambiguity: The sentence is ambiguous, as it isn't clear whether Cheryl is the one standing while passing the books or if she is making the books stand in a specific order. In either case, the word \\"stand\\" is likely an inappropriate choice of verb to convey the intended action. 2. Improper prepositions: The preposition \\"from\\" is used here to indicate the relationship between Edna and the books. However, it is unclear as to whether this means that the books belong(ed) to Edna, or if Edna previously had possession of the books. If the intention is to indicate that Cheryl is giving the books to Sarah, then a more appropriate preposition would be \\"to\\" (e.g., \\"Cheryl passed the books to Sarah\\"). If the intention is to communicate that the action of standing the books is being done in order to create a specific arrangement, then we might see a sentence like \\"Cheryl stood the books from Edna's collection next to Sarah's.\\" To revise this sentence and make it linguistically acceptable, we should first clarify its intended meaning. If the intention is to convey the act of Cheryl passing the books from Edna to Sarah, the sentence could be rewritten as: - \\"Cheryl passed the books from Edna to Sarah.\\" If the intention is to convey the act of Cheryl arranging the books in a specific order, the sentence could be rewritten as: - \\"Cheryl arranged the books from Edna's collection next to Sarah's.\\" In either case, by rephrasing the sentence to better clarify the intended meaning and by using appropriate verb and preposition choices, we can create a sentence that a linguist would rate as acceptable linguistically."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a question and you have to answer the question based on your knowledge.

His compositions include melodies, solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite Trois mouvements perpetuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champetre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the Organ Concerto (1938), the opera Dialogues des Carmelites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Context: Poulenc, a highly accomplished pianist, usually composed at the piano and wrote many pieces for the instrument throughout his career. In Henri Hell's view, Poulenc's piano writing can be divided into the percussive and the gentler style reminiscent of the harpsichord. Hell considers that the finest of Poulenc's music for piano is in the accompaniments to the songs, a view shared by Poulenc himself. The vast majority of the piano works are, in the view of the writer Keith W Daniel, \\"what might be called 'miniatures'\\". Looking back at his piano music in the 1950s, the composer viewed it critically: \\"I tolerate the Mouvements perpetuels, my old Suite en ut [in C], and the Trois pieces. I like very much my two collections of Improvisations, an Intermezzo in A flat, and certain Nocturnes. I condemn Napoli and the Soirees de Nazelles without reprieve.\\" Of the pieces cited with approval by Poulenc, the fifteen Improvisations were composed at intervals between 1932 and 1959. All are brief: the longest lasts a little more than three minutes. They vary from swift and balletic to tender lyricism, old-fashioned march, perpetuum mobile, waltz and a poignant musical portrait of the singer Edith Piaf. Poulenc's favoured Intermezzo was the last of three. Numbers one and two were composed in August 1934; the A flat followed in March 1943. The commentators Marina and Victor Ledin describe the work as \\"the embodiment of the word 'charming'. The music seems simply to roll off the pages, each sound following another in such an honest and natural way, with eloquence and unmistakable Frenchness.\\" The eight nocturnes were composed across nearly a decade (1929-38). Whether or not Poulenc originally conceived them as an integral set, he gave the eighth the title \\"To serve as Coda for the Cycle\\" (Pour servir de Coda au Cycle). Although they share their generic title with the nocturnes of Field, Chopin and Faure, Poulenc's do not resemble those of the earlier composers, being \\"night-scenes and sound-images of public and private events\\" rather than romantic tone poems. The pieces Poulenc found merely tolerable were all early works: Trois mouvements perpetuels dates from 1919, the Suite in C from 1920 and the Trois pieces from 1928. All consist of short sections, the longest being the \\"Hymne\\", the second of the three 1928 pieces, which lasts about four minutes. Of the two works their composer singled out for censure, Napoli (1925) is a three-movement portrait of Italy, and Les Soirees de Nazelles is described by the composer Geoffrey Bush as \\"the French equivalent of Elgar's Enigma Variations\\" - miniature character sketches of his friends. Despite Poulenc's scorn for the work, Bush judges it ingenious and witty. Among the piano music not mentioned, favourably or harshly, by Poulenc, the best known pieces include the two Novelettes (1927-28), the set of six miniatures for children, Villageoises (1933), a piano version of the seven-movement Suite francaise (1935), and L'embarquement pour Cythere for two pianos (1953). Question: Did he perform these pieces himself? Answer:","response":"Yes, Francis Poulenc was a highly accomplished pianist, and he usually composed at the piano. He performed many of his own pieces, like his piano suites, improvisations, and nocturnes. He also played music for many of his compositions, including songs, ballets, and orchestral concerts. So, when he created all these beautiful piano pieces, he liked to play them himself and share them with others."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

An image is shown of a plate of sardine pasta, along with a list of ingredients. water","response":"An image is shown of a plate of sardine pasta, along with a list of ingredients, including a generous serving of water. The sardine pasta offers a delightful combination of flavors and textures, as the rich taste of the sardines blends harmoniously with the robust pasta, bathed in an aromatic sauce. The sauce, a delectable concoction of ripe tomatoes, extra-virgin olive oil, finely chopped garlic, and red pepper flakes, infuses every bite with a bold and zesty essence, giving the dish a sense of warmth and comfort. As for the pasta itself, it's cooked al dente, meaning that it is neither too soft nor too firm, offering the perfect toothsome texture. This is achieved by boiling fresh or dried pasta in a large pot of water, seasoned with a generous pinch of salt, until it has reached the desired tenderness. The type of pasta chosen for this enticing dish is typically a thicker and more robust variety, such as linguine or fettuccine – ideally suited to embrace the hearty sauce and ensnare the tender sardine pieces. Sardines, the star of the dish, are not only remarkable for their flavorful contribution to the pasta but are also well-known for their considerable health benefits - being an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are instrumental in promoting a healthy heart. The sardines, whether canned or fresh, are pan-fried beforehand in a dash of olive oil, accompanied by a sprinkle of salt and pepper to elevate their inherent flavors. Once golden and crispy, the sardines are then flaked and incorporated into the aromatic sauce, where they mingle with the other ingredients to create a culinary masterpiece. No sardine pasta would be complete without a generous helping of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, which imparts a nutty and slightly tangy flavor and impels every forkful with added depth. A spritz of lemon juice is also suggested as a way to create an additional layer of brightness, as the citrusy notes help to accentuate the overall savoriness of the dish. Finally, to round off the sardine pasta experience, we have a sprinkling of freshly chopped parsley, added right before serving. The verdant herb imparts a touch of freshness to the plate, its mild and subtly sweet taste serving as a perfect foil to the bold and intense flavors of the dish. Paired with a crisp glass of white wine and a slice of crusty bread to mop up any excess sauce, this gastronomic delight is an absolute must-try for seafood and pasta lovers alike, as it provides a symphony of flavors that are difficult to resist."},{"question":"Question: What is Haeckel unsuccessful in creating?

Ralston asks Miz Carnation, a necromancer, to revive his recently deceased wife; she refuses, but then decides to tell him the story of Ernst Haeckel, and says that, if he still wishes to revive his wife afterwards, she will do as he asks. Main story[edit] The story mainly concerns Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil), who is trying to follow in the footsteps of Victor Frankenstein, but is unsuccessful with his attempts to create life. He learns of Montesquino, a necromancer, but believes that the man is a charlatan. Learning of his father's ill condition, he travels and encounters Walter Wolfram (Tom McBeath) and his wife Elise (Leela Savasta). Haeckel is oddly drawn to Elise and vice versa. Wolfram seems undisturbed by the attraction but when unearthly shrieks echo outside, Elise is drawn to them. Haeckel also notices that Elise is caring for a baby. Elise finally goes outside and the despondent Wolfram notes that he can't satisfy his wife, although he has sold everything he has to take care of her. Haeckel goes after Elise and follows the shrieks to a nearby necropolis. There he discovers that Elise is having sexual consort with her dead husband and the other resurrected corpses. Wolfram has paid Montesquino to raise the dead so that they can satisfy Elise. When Wolfram tries to take her home, the corpses kill him. Haeckel confronts Montesquino and demands that he make it stop. The necromancer says that he cannot, and an angry Haeckel shoots him as he tries to escape. The dying Montesquino shoves Haeckel into a tombstone, knocking him out. The next morning, Haeckel wakes up and returns to the cabin, where he finds Elise nursing the baby: a corpse-child, the son of her \\"true\\" husband. The baby rips out Haeckel's throat.

Give them the umbrella so they can go on their way. When your birthday or holidays draw near, your friends and family might start asking you what you want. Ask them to make a charitable contribution to an organization of their choice (or of your choice) instead of getting you a gift. There are many ways to become a mentor. For instance, if you’re a strong reader and writer, you could help out a young person who you know needs help writing an essay for school. If you know a teen neighbor needs help finding a job but their parents are too busy, you could teach them how to browse classifieds, develop a resume, and dress properly for an interview. If you have a valuable skill set, you could put your abilities to work as a volunteer with an organization. For instance, if you’re a lawyer, you might offer to help out at a nonprofit that needs help with a legal matter. If you’re an electrician, you might be able to help fix electrical problems at your local homeless shelter or soup kitchen. If you see someone waiting at the bus stop or trying in vain to hail a taxi, pull over and offer them a ride to their destination. The stranger is even more likely to appreciate and accept your offer if the weather is poor. Contact local music venues and ask if they would be willing to host an event for a charity. Once you’ve secured a venue, contact some local musicians and ask if they would be interested in performing in a charity concert. Once you have three or four bands or musicians available, advertise the event on social media and in local papers. Donate the ticket sales to a worthy charity. Encourage musicians and music venues to participate in your event by reminding them that while they won’t make money directly from ticket sales of the event, they will get positive exposure. Music venues, additionally, will earn money from the sale of food and drinks during the concert, while musicians can sell their records and other merchandise. Identify charities that match your interests, then research each to ensure they are legitimate. Check each organization’s website for a clear mission statement and lists of its programs, board of directors, and accomplishments. Find out how you can make a donation by checking the organization’s website. The easiest way will probably be to use a credit card, PayPal, or another digital payment service. Many charities also accept checks or money orders. If you can’t find information online about how to make a donation, call the charity’s offices directly and inquire about how to do so. Use a third-party site like CharityWatch or GuideStar to identify charities and nonprofits that are legitimate.

Nielsen was born the seventh of twelve children to a poor peasant family on 9 June 1865 at Sortelung near Nørre Lyndelse, south of Odense on the island of Funen. His father, Niels Jørgensen, was a house painter and traditional musician who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography Min Fynske Barndom (My Childhood on Funen). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837–1881), was a talented musician.Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \\"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin\\". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense.Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 øre and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances.

(A). no; (B). yes;","response":"(B). yes; Both sentences essentially convey the same meaning. There are only minor differences in the phrasing and punctuation, but these do not change the core meaning of the sentences. In both sentences, the key points are: 1. The thirteen colonies of the Anglo-United States were all original possessions. This implies that the colonies were the initial territories that made up the United States and were under British control before gaining independence. 2. Popular culture became a major foundation of American folk and former British music.

Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech..., can you guess it ?

It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. The term is most often used with reference to medieval Western Europe. Antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later Roman Empire (Dominate). With a declining birthrate and population, labor was the key factor of production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade, councilors were forbidden to resign, and coloni, the cultivators of land, were not to move from the land they were attached to. The workers of the land were on their way to becoming serfs. Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such coloni: it was possible to be described as servus et colonus, \\"both slave and colonus\\". Laws of Constantine I around 325 both reinforced the semi-servile status of the coloni and limited their rights to sue in the courts; the Codex Theodosianus promulgated under Theodosius II extended these restrictions. The legal status of adscripti, \\"bound to the soil\\", contrasted with barbarian foederati, who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries, remaining subject to their own traditional law. As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations. The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted. The thesis put forward by Henri Pirenne, while disputed widely, supposes that the Arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralization and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centers. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did Manoralism begin?","response":"Manorialism began as an organizing principle of rural economy originating in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire. It was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe, and emerged as a result of a blend of factors from the late Roman Empire, such as the rural self-sufficiency spurred by disruptions in Mediterranean trade, and evolving socio-economic conditions. As the Roman Empire declined, labor became the key factor of production, and administrations attempted to stabilize the economy by freezing the social structures in place. The cultivators of land, or coloni, started to become serfs under this developing system. The Germanic kingdoms, which succeeded Roman authority in the West during the fifth century, also contributed to this transition. Often, Roman landlords were replaced by Germanic ones without significant changes to the existing situation or displacement of populations. The Arab conquests in the Mediterranean Sea region further reinforced the process of rural self-sufficiency, contributing to the development of the classic feudal pattern, which consisted of varying degrees of servile peasantry under a hierarchy of localized power centers. Ultimately, these historical and socio-economic factors led to the establishment of manorialism as an essential element of feudal society in medieval Europe."},{"question":"Use some thinking to answer the following question. Find the 100th place digit of a number forming from digits 1 to 9 without repeatation and number passes the divisibility test of 11 means difference of sum of alternative digits is 0 or divisible by 11. Options: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5","response":"To solve this problem, first, we need to find a number formed by the digits 1-9 without repetition that passes the divisibility test of 11. The rule for testing divisibility by 11 is that the difference between the sums of the alternating digits must be 0 or divisible by 11. Step 1: Test the sums of alternating digits. Let's consider a number of the form ABCDEFGHI, where each letter corresponds to one of the digits from 1 to 9. For the number to be divisible by 11, (A + C + E + G + I) - (B + D + F + H) should be 0 or divisible by 11. Step 2: Find sets of digits that satisfy the divisibility rule. We need to divide the digits into two groups, such that the sum of the digits in each group is the same or has a difference divisible by 11. There are a few possible combinations that satisfy this condition: - (1 + 3 + 6 + 8) - (2 + 4 + 5 + 7) = 18 - 18 = 0 - (1 + 4 + 6 + 9) - (2 + 3 + 5 + 7) = 20 - 17 = 3 - (1 + 4 + 7 + 9) - (2 + 3 + 5 + 6) = 21 - 16 = 5 Step 3: Choose a combination that will lead to the 100th digit. Out of the combinations in Step 2, we only need to consider the ones that have a difference of 0 (mod 11), since those combinations will create numbers that are divisible by 11. In this case, we have just one such combination: - (1 + 3 + 6 + 8) - (2 + 4 + 5 + 7) = 0 Step 4: Arrange the digits in increasing order. Now arrange the numbers using the combined digits we got from the step above, in the increasing order of magnitude for each number: (1, 3, 6, 8) and (2, 4, 5, 7). This gives the number 13,628,457,9. We see that the 100th place digit from the largest digit in this combined number (9) is 3. So our answer is (C) 3."},{"question":"This is a notice to inform you that the server where your Outlook mailbox resides is scheduled for an outage tonight.

Solve this problem.","response":"To solve the equation -72 = 6*p - 42 for p, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable p. To do this, you want to get rid of the -42 on the right side of the equation. Since it's a subtraction, you should add 42 to both sides of the equation to maintain the equality: -72 + 42 = 6*p - 42 + 42 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. -72 + 42 = -30, and -42 + 42 equals 0, so the equation becomes: -30 = 6*p Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, you need to isolate it by eliminating the coefficient, which is 6 in this case. Since 6 is being multiplied by p, you should divide both sides of the equation by 6: -30 / 6 = 6*p / 6 Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation. -30 / 6 = -5, and 6*p / 6 equals p, so the equation becomes: -5 = p Now you have found the value of p: p = -5."},{"question":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: lightning and storm clouds over the mountains","response":"1.

Step 2: Evaluate the feasibility of each option - Affected by weather: Extreme weather conditions, such as drought or flooding, can affect a tree's root growth. However, without more context about the specific garden or weather conditions, it's hard to determine if this is the primary reason the roots have stopped spreading. - Wall in: Physical barriers, like walls or compacted soil, can impede root growth. If there is a wall or some other barrier in the garden, it could be preventing the roots from expanding further. - Grow tall: It's possible that the tree is prioritizing vertical growth instead of root growth, especially if it's competing for sunlight with other trees. However, this assumption might not hold if there are no other competitors or if the tree is already taller than the canopy of trees surrounding it. - Burn: Root damage as a result of a fire can lead to stunted root growth. However, without information about recent fire events, it is difficult to establish a correlation between the roots' growth and a potential burn. - Hatred: Although it is a figurative term, \\"hatred\\" could be interpreted as intentional actions, such as chemical applications or root pruning, which might limit root growth. However, as we don't have enough context about the garden or tree's surroundings, considering this factor might not be enough to establish a clear cause. Step 3: Select the most likely option based on the given context Given the lack of contextual information, the most feasible option appears to be \\"wall in,\\" as a physical barrier in the garden, like a wall or compacted soil, would directly hinder the tree's roots from spreading. Other options can't be completely ruled out without additional information, but \\"wall in\\" seems the most generic in the context of a garden and may be the most probable cause for the roots to stop spreading."},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity, the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures.\\" answer the question \\"What types of Christianity do Quakers belong to?\\" (A). yes.

A blowfish, also known as a pufferfish, belongs to the family Tetraodontidae and comprises over 120 species. These creatures are typically found in warm and temperate marine waters and can also be found in some freshwater locations. Their natural habitats include oceans, seas, and estuaries in regions like the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, as well as the Red Sea and the Caribbean Sea. When considering the options provided: - Jungle: Blowfish are aquatic creatures and are not found in jungles. Jungles primarily consist of dense forest areas and terrestrial wildlife, making it an unsuitable environment for a blowfish. - Sea Water: This is the best and most accurate answer. Zoos aim to create environments that closely resemble the natural habitats of the species they house. Since blowfish naturally inhabit sea waters, you would find them in a designated sea water exhibit designed to replicate their natural habitat. - Cuba: While it is true that blowfish can be found in the waters surrounding Cuba, this option is not the most specific answer and doesn't pertain directly to a zoo environment. - Atlantic Ocean: Blowfish are indeed known to inhabit the Atlantic Ocean. However, this option doesn't provide information about where to find them within a zoo setting. - Lake: Though some freshwater species of blowfish can be found in lakes, they are more commonly associated with sea water habitats. This option is also not specific to a zoo environment. In conclusion, the best answer is the sea water option.

But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? A:","response":"People in inland areas are more at risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency as compared to those in coastal areas. Iodine is an essential element for the production of thyroid hormones, which play crucial roles in the development of the brain and nervous system, particularly during fetal and early childhood development. An inadequate supply of iodine in the diet can lead to a range of disorders, including mental retardation, stunted growth, and even goiter. In coastal regions, the soil, water, and food resources available are typically abundant in iodine. Seafood, seaweed, and other marine products serve as excellent sources of iodine, and their consumption ensures that the population residing in these areas has a sufficient intake of this vital element. Moreover, the iodine present in the coastal environment can also infiltrate the soil through weathering and erosion, making it available to crops and livestock. Consequently, people in coastal areas are generally less prone to iodine deficiency-related ailments. In contrast, inland areas face a higher risk of iodine deficiency due to a lack of natural iodine sources. Soils in these regions usually contain very low levels of iodine, which consequently affects the crops and animals raised on this land. As a result, food items in inland areas tend to have reduced iodine content. Also, processed foods made from these crops typically lose additional iodine during manufacturing or cooking, further lowering their iodine levels. These factors contribute to an increased vulnerability to iodine deficiency disorders among inland populations. Mental retardation poses a serious risk, especially in children who do not receive adequate iodine during critical developmental phases. Studies have found that iodine-deficient children may experience cognitive delays, lowered IQ, and long-term neurological deficits. Apart from mental retardation, iodine deficiency can also cause goiter, hypothyroidism, delayed growth, and reproductive issues in affected populations. Preventing iodine deficiency is crucial, especially in inland areas. One effective measure is the iodization of table salt, which ensures that every household has access to iodine in their daily meals. Other strategies may include providing iodine supplements to at-risk populations, nutrition education, and promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods where available. In conclusion, people living in inland areas face a higher risk of mental retardation and other iodine deficiency-related health issues compared to those living in coastal regions, primarily due to the limited availability of natural iodine in their food sources and environment. Efforts to mitigate this risk should focus on providing adequate iodine to these populations through dietary and supplemental means."},{"question":"By. Sean Poulter. Npower is axing almost 2,000 staff as it outsources work to India, it emerged last night. Just weeks before Christmas, the firm has decided to close its British call centres. The move was condemned by the GMB and Unison unions, who called for a public inquiry into the way Npower is being run. Npower has decided to close its British call centres, axing almost 2,000 staff just weeks before Christmas. It is understood that sites at Peterlee in County Durham, Thornaby in North Yorkshire, and Stoke will be closed, with the transfer of 1,400 jobs to India, while 570 customer service jobs will go to another company in Britain. Npower is owned by RWE of Germany, which earlier this week dumped a project to build a vast wind farm in the Bristol Channel. Colin Smith, of the GMB, said: ‘This is about cost of living, bad management and naked greed.. ‘At this time of the year, when the Christmas lights are being turned on for most people, Npower workers their families and communities have no Yuletide greetings. ‘They have only fear from a company only interested in their fat-cat salaries and what they can get out of consumers who are paying ever higher energy prices so corporate bureaucrats can get fatter as their reward for failure. 'It is an absolute scandal that a company like Npower can operate as a cartel player in a captive market, while jobs are placed offshore.’ Npower is to move all UK call centres to India. Matthew Lay, Unison national officer, said: ‘Npower have consistently let their customers and staff down by not investing enough in the workforce, technology or the latest customer-service techniques. ‘This has led to a huge number of complaints which the company seems to think they can deal with by shifting the responsibility to somewhere else, including India. ‘If the company goes ahead with this disastrous plan, it will backfire badly, damaging their already tarnished reputation for service.’ Its poor record on complaints, a punishing 10.2 per cent price rise and its failure to pay tax have angered many customers of Britain’s most expensive energy firm. But chief executive Paul Massara, who earns £600,000, has rejected calls to give up a bonus of £150,000 awarded for hitting targets for employee and customer satisfaction. Just last week, Npower was named and shamed as the nation’s worst performer for customer service. The company receives 202.5 complaints for every 100,000 customers – five times more than the best energy supplier. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at official customer watchdog Consumer Futures, said Npower’s performance was ‘unacceptable’ and it was unclear how moving call centre services to outside firms would improve the situation. She added: ‘Energy companies have repeatedly said they want to rebuild consumer trust. Good customer service and complaints handling are key ingredients to achieving this and suppliers still have a long way to go.’ The firm is also about to hit customers with a 10.2 per cent rise in the cost of heat and light, which will take average bills up by £139 to just under £1,500 a year. Npower said: ‘Npower has been undertaking a major review of sites, operations and people across the UK to improve customer service and keep costs down, at a time of external pressures on customers’ bills.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"Npower, a big energy company, decided to remove a lot of people from their jobs in the UK and move these jobs to a far away place called India. This is because it costs less money for the company to have people working there. Many people are upset because it is happening close to a special holiday called Christmas, and those people who lost their jobs will have a harder time enjoying the holiday. Some people in charge, like the GMB and Unison unions, are really unhappy about this decision and want to investigate if Npower is being managed correctly. This decision might also hurt Npower's reputation, because they already have many unhappy customers due to high prices and bad service."},{"question":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what artist have song with ashanti?

Researchers said the mummy was one of two females found in 1903 in a small tomb believed to be that of Hatshepsut's nurse, Sitre In.

The decisive truth-telling fact was a tooth in a wooden box marked with the queen's name, Hawass said. The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty .

Select from: a. yes. b. it is not possible to tell. c. no.","response":"c. no. The terms \\"Old Kingdom\\" and \\"Middle Kingdom\\" relate to specific periods in the historical timeline of Ancient Egypt, while \\"The Left and Young Kingdoms\\" doesn't correspond to any particular eras in history. Furthermore, \\"left\\" and \\"young\\" are not chronological or historical terms. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of these periods, it is crucial to look at them separately. 1. The Old Kingdom (2686 - 2181 BCE): The Old Kingdom is usually regarded as the first of three golden eras of Ancient Egypt, followed by the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom period is marked by some of Egypt's most well-known accomplishments, primarily in art and architecture. The Old Kingdom era is sometimes referred to as the \\"Age of Pyramids,\\" due to the construction of the most famous Egyptian pyramids during this time. The Step Pyramid of Djoser, the first pyramid of Egypt, built by the architect Imhotep, is a notable example. Other renowned pyramids constructed during this period include the Great Pyramid of Giza, which was built for the Pharaoh Khufu, as well as the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure. During the Old Kingdom, pharaohs and their administrations achieved remarkable political stability and organization. The central government was highly active, and civil service was introduced. The artistic achievements of this period are also significant, as art became more formalized and idealized, setting the standards for later periods. The Old Kingdom finally came to an end because of increasing political instability, regional rivalries, and droughts. This led to a period of decline known as the First Intermediate Period. 2. The Middle Kingdom (2055 - 1650 BCE): The Middle Kingdom is characterized by a period of reunification and stability after the chaos and disarray that marked the First Intermediate Period. The Pharaohs Mentuhotep II and Amenemhat I are credited with reuniting Egypt during this time. This period is known for its significant advancements in various forms of art, literature, and architecture. The Middle Kingdom produced the first known pieces of Egyptian literature, such as the 'Tale of Sinuhe' and the 'Instructions of Amenemhat.' The art of this period exhibits more realism and portrays people in more personal and individual ways, as opposed to the Old Kingdom's formalized style. The Middle Kingdom also saw developments in architectural techniques. The period featured a shift from pyramids to rock-cut tombs. Osiride columns and papyrus capitals were also introduced during this era. The decline of the Middle Kingdom can be attributed to various factors, including weak pharaohs, internal strife, and the invasion of the Hyksos, a group from Western Asia. This decline led to the Second Intermediate Period, which eventually gave way to the New Kingdom, the third major era of Ancient Egypt. In conclusion, \\"The Left and Young Kingdoms\\" does not follow the historical context or timeline of Ancient Egypt. It is important to recognize the specific concepts, achievements, and events of the Old and Middle Kingdoms to better understand their place in the grand narrative of ancient Egyptian civilization."},{"question":"Komatsubara was born on July 28 , 1992 , in Okayama , Japan .

Review title: you get what you pay for Product review: Got this dutch oven to try because it was inexpensive. Tried frying potatoes in it once but even after coating the bottom with a generous amount of olive oil, had a one inch layer of potatoes on the bottom which was very difficult to remove. I bought it mainly to brown meat, and maybe I shouldn't have attempted to fry potatoes in it, but I still have brown spots on the enamel from my first cooking expedition. Frying potatoes and browning meat, though, is a similar process so my impression is that this is a cheap dutch oven. My friend has a Le Crueset pot that this doesn't happen to. It's probably best for simmering stews and sauces, but I'd rather use my stainless steel pots which heat evenly, don't weigh 20 pounds, and are easy to clean.

Options: - movie - casino - theatre - show - comedy The answer is \\"movie\\" because The answer is:","response":"\\"movie\\" because movies are a popular form of visual entertainment that are specifically created to be viewed on a screen. They are a versatile and engaging medium that caters to various tastes and preferences, offering a wide range of genres, themes, and narratives to capture the imagination and provide a compelling viewing experience. Movies are an ideal choice for entertainment on a screen because they cater to an individual's or group's specific interests, mood, and desired level of engagement. A movie, also known as a film or motion picture, is a form of storytelling that uses moving images to tell a fictional or non-fictional narrative. These moving images are created by capturing a series of still images with photographic equipment and then projecting them in rapid succession onto a screen, creating the appearance of continuous motion. The process of creating movies typically involves a combination of various elements, such as cinematography, sound design, editing, and direction, to craft a cohesive and engaging story that is both visually and emotionally captivating. The other options provided - casino, theatre, show, and comedy - may also offer entertainment on a screen, but not in the same way or to the same extent as movies. Casinos are primarily associated with gambling and gaming, with screen-based entertainment often being a secondary consideration. Casino screens usually display information related to games, such as roulette wheels or slot machines, rather than conveying a comprehensive narrative or evoking an emotional response. Theatre refers to the art of live performance and typically takes place on a stage, not on a screen. Although recorded theatrical performances can be enjoyed on a screen, the primary medium for theatre is still a live, in-person experience. A \\"show\\" is a more general term that can encompass various forms of entertainment, from live performances to television series. In some cases, a show may be an appropriate answer when referring to screen-based entertainment, such as when watching a TV series. However, the term is not as specific or definitive as \\"movie\\" when addressing entertainment on a screen. \\"Comedy\\" is a genre of entertainment rather than a specific format. While it is true that comedy can be enjoyed on a screen in the form of comedic movies or TV shows, the term itself does not directly indicate a screen-based form of entertainment. In summary, the answer \\"movie\\" is the most fitting of the provided options because movies are specifically produced for the purpose of providing visual entertainment on a screen. They encompass a vast array of narrative styles, genres, and themes, making them appealing and engaging to diverse audiences. While the other options may offer varying levels of screen-based entertainment, none of them are as focused, versatile, or universally enjoyable as movies."},{"question":"Available choices: (i). flask was almost full.

Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis.

A high bridge spans a ravine on the Bataan Peninsula. After the army and some civilians cross, a group of thirteen hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. They dig in on a hillside, setting up heavy machine guns in sandbag fortifications. They succeed in blowing up the bridge, but their commander, Captain Henry Lassiter, is killed by a sniper, leaving Sergeant Dane in charge. One by one, the defenders are killed, while Ramirez succumbs to malaria. Despite this, the outnumbered soldiers doggedly hold their position. Malloy shoots down a Japanese aircraft with his Tommy gun before being killed. Dane and Todd creep up, undetected, on the partially rebuilt bridge and throw Mk 2 hand grenades, blowing it up. There is also tension between Dane and Todd. Dane suspects that Todd is a soldier from his past named Danny Burns who was arrested for killing a man in a dispute, but escaped while Dane was guarding him. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Steve Bentley and his Filipino mechanic, Corporal Juan Katigbak, work frantically to repair a Beechcraft C-43 Traveler aircraft. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed and Bentley is mortally wounded. Dying, he has explosives loaded aboard and crashes the C-43 into the bridge's foundation, destroying it for a third time. The remaining soldiers repel a massive frontal assault, inflicting heavy losses and ultimately fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed, leaving only Dane, Todd, and a wounded Purckett alive. Purckett is shot, while Todd stabbed through the back by a Japanese soldier who had only feigned being dead.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group would have more warm blood near the surface of the skin? Hint: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. A:","response":"The group that would have more warm blood near the surface of the skin would be the blue group, which consumed the blue drink containing alcohol. As mentioned in the hint, alcoholic beverages cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood, creating the sensation of warmth. Although this sensation doesn't make the entire body warmer, it does result in the presence of more warm blood near the skin's surface. In contrast, the red group that consumed the non-alcoholic red drink would not experience this effect as their drink does not contain any alcohol to cause the blood vessels to dilate.

When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. In 1485, following his death in battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field, Richard III's body was buried in Greyfriars Church in Leicester. Following the discoveries of Richard's remains in 2012, it was decided that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite feelings in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him in The Hollow Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. His cathedral tomb was designed by the architects van Heyningen and Haward. The tombstone is deeply incised with a cross, and consists of a rectangular block of white Swaledale fossil stone, quarried in North Yorkshire. It sits on a low plinth made of dark Kilkenny marble, incised with Richard's name, dates and motto (Loyaulte me lie - loyalty binds me). The plinth also carries his coat of arms in pietra dura. The remains of Richard III are in a lead-lined coffin, inside an outer English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard's sister Anne of York, and laid in a brick-lined vault below the floor, and below the plinth and tombstone. The original 2010 raised tomb design had been proposed by Langley\`s \\"Looking For Richard Project\\" and fully funded by members of the Richard III Society. The proposal was publicly launched by the Society on 13 February 2013 but rejected by Leicester Cathedral in favour of a memorial slab. However, following a public outcry, the Cathedral changed its position and on 18 July 2013 announced its agreement to give King Richard III a raised tomb monument.

A: Later the region saw the first states to adopt Christianity officially - initially in Armenia (301 AD) and in Georgia (337 AD), later in the Great Russian Principality (Kyivan Rus, Russian: Великое княжество Русское, ca 988 AD). Does the answer correctly answer the question Select from the following. [a]. yes; [b]. no;","response":"A: Armenia adopted Christianity as its state religion in 301 AD, making it the first nation to do so. The conversion is traditionally attributed to the missionary work of St. Gregory the Illuminator. The adoption of Christianity was a significant event for Armenia and had far-reaching implications for the nation's cultural, political, and spiritual development. The history of Christianity in Armenia goes back to the 1st century AD when the apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus are believed to have preached the gospel in the region. However, it took several centuries for the faith to spread widely, and the efforts of St. Gregory the Illuminator were critical to the Christianization of the Armenian people. St. Gregory, whose original name was Grigor Lusavorich, was born into a noble Armenian family but grew up in the Roman Empire. He returned to Armenia as a missionary after having been educated in the Christian faith. His relentless efforts to spread Christianity and his successful conversion of King Tiridates III were crucial factors in the adoption of Christianity as the state religion in 301 AD. The adoption of Christianity as the state religion separated Armenia from its neighboring states and the traditional Armenian religion, giving the nation a distinct identity. This also helped strengthen the bond between the Armenian Church and the ruling elite, as well as enabled the church to play an essential role in the nation's social and political life. Along with the political implications, Christianity also had a significant impact on Armenia's cultural development. The introduction of the Armenian alphabet by St. Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD facilitated the translation of religious texts, such as the Bible, and helped lay the foundation for Armenian literature, education, and art. To summarize, Armenia adopted Christianity as its state religion in 301 AD, thanks to the missionary work of St. Gregory the Illuminator. The conversion had lasting effects on Armenia's political, cultural, and spiritual identity, distinguishing it from its neighboring states and leading to the emergence of a distinctive Armenian civilization."},{"question":"Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically as category: b).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less sound waves hit the mouth happens, how will it affect more echoes are produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if less sound waves are emitted from the bat's mouth, there will be a greater production of echoes. However, this may not be entirely accurate. The relationship between sound waves and echoes is not directly proportional. Rather, if a bat emits fewer sound waves, it is likely to receive fewer echoes. This is because echoes are produced when sound waves hit an object and then return to the bat's ears. If there are fewer sound waves, then there is a lower probability for them to hit an object and produce echoes. In terms of the effect on the overall process of echolocation, the perturbation may have a negative impact. Since the bat relies on these echoes to locate objects, a decrease in emitted sound waves and consequently, fewer echoes received, may result in decreased accuracy and effectiveness in their echolocation abilities. Such perturbations could make it more difficult for the bat to navigate their environment and locate objects, ultimately affecting their ability to find food and avoid obstacles. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis's assumption that fewer sound waves will result in more echoes is incorrect. Instead, fewer sound waves are likely to produce fewer echoes, which could negatively affect the bat's echolocation process and overall spatial awareness."},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the track Ryan Seacrest erroneously announced was available for purchase on the iTunes Store?, using the article: Although a low-quality version leaked on December 31, 2014, a full version of the recording was not made available for the public.

There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\". - History. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden.

Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse.

A simple sentence can have an object or additional information but it is not necessary. Since the goal is to generate a short sentence, I'll keep it simple by not adding any. Step 5: Review and finalize the sentence. Looking at the subject and verb, the sentence \\"The dog barked.\\" is linguistically acceptable as it has proper subject-verb agreement and conveys a complete thought. Final Sentence: The dog barked."},{"question":"Solve -1693*p - 17643 = -1315 + 24304 for p.. What is the answer??","response":"To solve the given equation for p: Step 1: Write down the equation. -1693*p - 17643 = -1315 + 24304 Step 2: Start by simplifying the equation. Combine the constant terms on the right-hand side. -1693*p - 17643 = 24304 - 1315 Step 3: Calculate the simplified right-hand side. 24304 - 1315 = 22989 Now the equation becomes: -1693*p - 17643 = 22989 Step 4: Move the constant term from the left-hand side to the right-hand side to isolate \\"p\\" term. -1693*p = 22989 + 17643 Step 5: Calculate the simplified right-hand side. 22989 + 17643 = 40632 Now the equation becomes: -1693*p = 40632 Step 6: Divide both sides by the coefficient of \\"p\\" which is -1693. p = 40632 / -1693 Step 7: Calculate the value of p. p ≈ -24.01 So, p ≈ -24.01 which is the solution to the equation."},{"question":"Avrupa Komisyonu (AK) 29 Ocak Perşembe günü yaptığı açıklamada, telekom düzenleme şirketinin bağımsızlığının ciddi derecede ihlali nedeniyle Romanya hakkında ihlal işlemi başlattığını duyurdu.

Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived. But I can use this background: Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" What is an answer for this question: Which continent caused less tropical forest destruction?

It is a simple one-to-one translation. \\"it would take ambitious proposals\\" is translated to \\"vaadittaisiin kunnianhimoisia ehdotuksia\\". In Finnish, \\"would take\\" can be translated to \\"vaadittaisiin,\\" which is the conditional form of the verb 'vaatia'. \\"Ambitious proposals\\" can be translated to \\"kunnianhimoisia ehdotuksia\\". \\"at the European level\\" is translated to \\"Euroopan tasolla\\" in Finnish. The word \\"level\\" is translated as \\"tasolla\\" which implies a level in context of an organization or system. \\"for us to make any headway\\" is translated to \\"että meidän olisi edistyttävä\\". In Finnish, \\"to make headway\\" can be directly translated to 'edistyä', which means 'to progress'. But here it's in conditional form which is \\"olisi edistyttävä\\" meaning 'should progress', to maintain sentence context. \\"in international negotiations\\" can be translated to \\"kansainvälisissä neuvotteluissa\\".

But we should have realized the quickest way to get a teenage boy to do something is to tell him not to do it. That’s why it doesn’t surprise us that the Biebs has been all about this look lately, wearing the questionable style nonstop over the past two weeks. He’s strutted around in them while shopping, making appearances, out at a club — and it even appears that a pair of tight-at-the-calves, loose-at-the-crotch white pants are part of the singer’s official tour uniform. (He’s worn them to all his concerts in the U.K. so far.) And while Bieber is loyal to this one silhouette, he’s not picky about the color, print or style, sporting a blue canvas pair one day, a purple cheetah pair the next, then continuing the streak with a leather design he’s clearly quite taken with. The more he wears the pants, the more confused we become. Bieber can’t possibly like the way the pants look, right? So he must be putting them on for some other reason. Here are some explanations we came up with: •One of the last outfits Selena Gomez saw him in before the two split included a pair of these perplexing pants. This is his way of reminding her that despite all the stories, he’s still the same guy she used to be in love with. •Being the fashion-forward dude that he is, he’s noticed that a skinnier leg is en vogue with men, but the allover supertight style isn’t compatible with his dance moves. So he had to find a type of pant that combined flexibility with fashion. Et voilá: the drop-crotch pant. •He’s trying to become a spokesperson for the Association of People With Long Torsos and Short Legs. Tell us: What do you think of Justin Bieber’s drop-crotch pants? Can you think of any other reasons why he might be wearing them? –Zoë Ruderman PHOTOS: VOTE ON MORE CONTROVERSIAL STAR STYLES HERE! ||||| Justin Bieber's current tour may be remembered for the debacle at London's O2, where weeping fans and furious parents endured a two-hour wait for his eventual appearance, but the defining image of his UK visit appeared in the press last week.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Thomas Kresk is a loser—he isn't good at his job, he's been tossed out of his home, and his wife just dumped him for the marriage counselor. Now he's depressed, and contemplating suicide. And yes, things get worse: a criminal named Avnet has stolen three priceless coins, and decided to blackmail Bollingsworth, his billionaire partner in crime. After Kresk overhears this, he almost gets shot—and Avnet ends up impaled on a pair of barbers' scissors. Now Kresk is in a considerably nastier situation, so he steals the gun and the coins. But things take a sharp turn when he hires a hit man named Mikey, and discovers that the hit man is only seventeen and emotionally traumatized by his parents' suicide. And that Kresk is falling for the cop/Playboy model Sgt. Meredith Kolko, and that his nephew Scottie has now swallowed the coins. Now Kresk is in over his head, and has to deal with the strange and sometimes dangerous people around him.

But so far this cycle, New Hampshire’s voters aren’t playing along. Donald Trump has led every poll in New Hampshire since June. Candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush have struggled to get out of the single digits. The weakness of mainstream candidates in New Hampshire poses a big challenge for the party’s beleaguered establishment. If a candidate acceptable to the party can’t win New Hampshire or Iowa, the G.O.P. will face a bleak choice: undertake the daunting and expensive task of mounting a come-from-behind effort, or grudgingly acquiesce to a candidate it really doesn’t want, like Ted Cruz, but who may be better than someone it can never accept, like Mr. Trump. The extent of the weakness of the establishment in New Hampshire is a striking departure from recent contests. In the polling data that The Upshot has collected from the last three Republican primaries, no one other than Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and George W. Bush led even a single New Hampshire Republican poll in the year ahead of the contest. Not only did surging conservatives like Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich never lead, but they also didn’t usually come close. After all, this is a state where Jon Huntsman won 17 percent of the vote in 2012. The traditional strength of the establishment in New Hampshire is underpinned by all of the state’s demographic characteristics. Self-identified moderate voters made up approximately half of the electorate in the last three contests, according to exit polls, compared with about a third nationally. Evangelical Christians, who represent a majority of Republican voters in the South and Iowa, represent around one-fifth of G.O.P. voters in New Hampshire. How is Mr. Trump doing so well? He’s drawing on many moderate and secular voters who haven’t supported the anti-establishment but usually religious candidates who have fared well in Iowa. The same pattern emerges in national polls, which often show Mr. Trump faring best among self-described moderates. The strength of a populist candidate like Mr. Trump, who opposes free trade and immigration, isn’t without precedent in New Hampshire. In 1992, Pat Buchanan, another anti-trade and anti-immigration candidate, won 38 percent of the vote against the incumbent president, George H.W. Bush. Four years later, Mr. Buchanan actually won the state, narrowly beating the eventual nominee, Bob Dole. But the G.O.P. establishment then was not in anywhere near the danger it is now. This year, the “outsider” candidates, like Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz and Ben Carson, possess as much organizational, financial and personal strength as the establishment candidates, or maybe more. This year’s schedule affords the party few opportunities to make a comeback: The contests after Iowa and New Hampshire — the Nevada caucuses, South Carolina and the predominantly Southern states on Super Tuesday — are all relatively favorable to conservatives. This year’s establishment candidates have shown far less strength, by any measure, than Mr. Dole or George H.W. Bush, who had the resources, name recognition and party backing to survive early setbacks. Mr. Trump is generally polling in the mid-20s in New Hampshire surveys. The large number of moderate, establishment-friendly candidates competing in New Hampshire might split the mainstream vote, preventing any one candidate from consolidating enough support to win. Many of these candidates have little chance to win the nomination, and some, like Chris Christie and John Kasich, barely register in national polls. But over all, Mr. Christie, Mr. Kasich, Jeb Bush, Mr. Rubio and Carly Fiorina combine for nearly 40 percent of the vote in New Hampshire polls, compared with around 25 percent in national surveys. There’s no guarantee that these voters, if their favorite exited, would coalesce behind any one of the other candidates in that group, but surely the establishment would be in a better position if there were not so many viable candidates competing for support in New Hampshire. Right now, there’s no good reason for any of them to leave. All of this creates a lot of danger for the party’s establishment. Its worst-case outcome is what the polls are already showing: a clear win for an unacceptable candidate, and the other candidates so evenly split and so far behind that the contest fails to clarify which candidate the establishment should coalesce behind. But there are other dangers, too, like the possibility that a relatively moderate candidate, like Mr. Kasich, could finish above mainstream candidates who are more acceptable to the establishment. The best case for the establishment, of course, would be if a mainstream candidate won the state and became the clear favorite of party elites in the process, but a strong second-place showing by an acceptable candidate would probably suffice. A strong second place for a candidate acceptable to the party would winnow the moderate wing of the field and position that candidate to ultimately consolidate party support and take a lead later in the primary season. There is a lot of time left until the February primary and just as much precedent for late movement. In 2008, Mr. McCain overcame a 15-point deficit over the final month of the race to defeat Mr. Romney by a comfortable margin. In the last cycle, Rick Santorum was polling in the single digits at this point in Iowa, but he ultimately surged in the final weeks to defeat Mr. Romney. There is enough time for Mr. Trump to fade, even if just by a little, allowing someone else to win. There is enough time for an establishment candidate to break out. There is even enough time for momentum and tactical voting to cause voters to consolidate behind a single candidate. So far, though, none of this has happened. Until it does, the establishment’s path to victory will look much longer than it has in any recent contest. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

Train and America are not relevant to this topic, as they are not related to meteorology or storm tracking. 2. Tropical seas and Caribbean are locations where meteorologists usually track storms, especially tropical storms and hurricanes. However, the question asks about where the storm did not show up for meteorologists. 3. Weather report is the most suitable answer, as these reports are prepared and issued by meteorologists to inform the public about the current and future weather conditions. If the storm didn't show up on a weather report, it would mean that meteorologists were not able to predict or detect its formation or trajectory, which is why the storm was surprising."},{"question":"Choose your answer: If \\"A man in a black shirt is holding a piece of corn over something.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A man in a shirt holding a peice of corn over a dog.\\"?

A wire comb is good for getting this type of debris out of dog toys that have fake fur on them. The washing machine is probably the best way to clean a soft dog toy. Check the tags on stuffed animals to ensure they can be put in the washing machine. Wash them on a gentle cycle with a mild detergent or no detergent at all. Once the washing machine has finished you can run the toys through the dryer on low heat for about 30 minutes. You also could allow them to air dry. It’s okay to throw tennis balls in the wash. Keep in mind that new tennis balls actually aren’t good for dogs, so throw the ball in the dirt a few times before giving it back to your dog. That way the chemicals from the packaging won’t irritate their throat. Try to remove as much excess crud as possible before you put the toy in the microwave. The heat from the microwave will do the rest to kill the bacteria and germs on the toy. Make sure you start by soaking the toys in water, ringing them out, and then placing them in the microwave. Run the microwave for 1 minute, keeping an eye on the toys while they heat. Be careful removing toys from the microwave, as they might be hot. Do not microwave a toy if it has any metal on it. Microwaving is a great idea for rope toys. Although it isn't a good idea to put stuffed animal toys or anything with plastic inside of it in the dishwasher, rope toys are fine. If you don’t have a microwave and you want to clean a rope toy you can easily throw it in a dishwasher with no detergent. The more often you clean the toy the better condition it will stay in. If you want to use the toy for longer, take good care of it. You could kill your animal this way and it isn’t worth the risk. The ASPCA says that using watered down bleach on non-porous toys is alright, but you should just stick with another cleaning solution that won’t endanger your dog.","response":"To clean a dog toy, you can use a wire comb or toothbrush to remove dirt and food.

With the increasing reliance on smartphones and the internet, traditional forms of print media, such as newspapers and magazines, are struggling to retain their relevance in society. Many well-established newspapers across the US have either downsized or ceased operations in the face of this digital onslaught. This has sparked a debate on whether the decline of print media is detrimental to the quality of journalism, as most news stories are now primarily accessed online through social media and news aggregators. Hypothesis: The decline of print media and the rise of digital news consumption may lead to shallow news reporting, emphasizing on sensationalism and clickbait, which could ultimately affect the quality of journalism. This phenomenon can be attributed to the shift in focus from long-form, in-depth stories towards shorter articles that cater to the shrinking attention span of today's digital audience, as well as the race amongst news agencies to generate more website traffic by producing breaking news or emotionally-charged articles to quickly capture their readers' attention."},{"question":"Choose your answer: Is \\"Restaurants specializing in the regional cuisines of Mexico's 31 states are available in the city.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What are some international cuisines offered in Mexico City?\\" OPT: A). yes.

Blankfein, 56, is in his sixth year at the helm of the largest U.S. investment bank, which has spent two years fending off accusations of conflicts of interest and fraud. The move to retain Weingarten comes as investigations of Goldman and its role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis continue. The news spooked already jittery investors. Goldman shares fell sharply in the final minutes of regular trading after Reuters reporting the hiring, finishing down 4.7 percent at 106.51, their lowest level since March 2009. They slipped further in after-hours trade to 105.45. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) in April released a scathing report that criticized Goldman for \\"exploiting\\" clients by unloading subprime loan exposure onto unsuspecting clients in 2006 and 2007, and concluded that its top executives misled Congress during testimony in 2010. Goldman has said it disagreed with many of the report's conclusions, but took seriously the issues addressed. The Justice Department launched its investigation in late April. On Monday, Goldman said: \\"As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department's inquiry into certain matters raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset.\\" Blankfein has not been charged in any civil or criminal case. \\"Why do you bring in someone like that?\\" said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, about Weingarten. \\"It says one thing: that they're taking it seriously.\\" Robert Hillman, law professor at the University of California at Davis, said the move showed that the CEO \\"has some concern over action that is likely to be taken, presumably by the Justice Department.\\" But he added, \\"It does not signify that he is guilty, or that any action is definitely going to be taken.\\" Weingarten, whose past clients include a former Enron accounting officer, was in a federal court in New York on Monday for the sentencing of another client, Anthony Cuti, the former CEO of the Duane Reade chain of drugstores, who was convicted of accounting fraud last year. Cuti was sentenced to three years in prison and a 5 million fine. Weingarten did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment. \\"This was the last thing that Goldman Sachs or any institutions in the sector needed,\\" said Peter Kenny, managing director of Knight Capital in Jersey City, NJ. \\"There is zero tolerance for risk or perceived risk right now.\\" HIGH-PROFILE CLIENTS A partner with Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Weingarten has represented a wide array of clients in criminal cases. They include former WorldCom Inc chief Bernard Ebbers, who was later convicted, and former Enron accounting officer Richard Causey, who pleaded guilty in exchange for a 5 to 7-year prison term. In May, his client, former GlaxoSmithKline lawyer Lauren Stevens, was acquitted of charges of lying and obstructing a probe into the company's marketing practices. \\"I'm used to these monstrously difficult cases where everybody hates my clients,\\" Weingarten told AmericanLawyer.com in May, although he described Stevens as a \\"beloved figure.\\" Controversy has continued to swirl around Goldman Sachs and Blankfein in the aftermath of the credit crisis in which Goldman was accused of favoring some clients over others, and of sometimes trading against the interest of clients. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scored a 550 million settlement against the bank in a fraud lawsuit in July 2010, but other investigations continue. In June, New York prosecutors subpoenaed the bank to explain its actions in the run-up to the financial crisis. In addition to the Justice Department, the New York Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating. It was not immediately clear what charges, if any, Blankfein could face personally. One former federal prosecutor, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Blankfein may have hired outside counsel after receiving a request from investigators for documents or other information. The Senate report raised questions about inconsistencies between testimony from Blankfein and other Goldman executives to Congress and emails unearthed in the Senate investigation. The subcommittee's chairman, Senator Carl Levin, has said the question of whether Blankfein and others committed perjury is up to the relevant federal agencies. The former prosecutor cautioned that perjury cases were difficult to prove, adding that prosecutors would not bring charges unless they had a \\"rock solid case.\\" Goldman earlier in August lowered its estimate for future legal costs to 2 billion from its 2.7 billion estimate three months earlier. It said it expects such costs to remain high for the foreseeable future. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Additional reporting by Carlyn Kolker, Andrew Longstreth and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Tim Dobbyn) ||||| Michael Stravato for The New York Times Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Goldman Sachs’s actions during the financial crisis returned to haunt it with a fury on Monday afternoon. In late trading, shares of Goldman tumbled nearly 5 percent, knocking 2.7 billion off the firm’s market value, after a report that the firm’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, had hired a prominent criminal defense lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten. Goldman, when confirming the hiring, portrayed it as routine, given the several government investigations faced by the firm. But the sharp reaction in the stock price showed the fragile nerves of investors, who are worried that potential legal liability could damage the firm and its earnings power. A spokesman for Goldman said executives at the firm were expected to be interviewed by the Justice Department. The agency is conducting an inquiry that stems from a 650-page report produced earlier this year by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. That report said that Goldman had misled clients about its practices related to mortgage-linked securities. “As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the P.S.I. report hired counsel at the outset,” Goldman Sachs said in a statement. While investors apparently feared the worst on Monday, a person close to the matter said that Mr. Blankfein had not been subpoenaed and that no Goldman executive had received an individual subpoena. Goldman is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation. Still, Monday’s stock fall underscored just how vulnerable Goldman’s stock would continue to be until the Justice Department and other authorities finished their investigations. “Until Goldman resolves its legal issues, the company and the stock are vulnerable to all sorts of perceptions, real or perceived,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole Securities. With about 20 minutes left in the trading day, Reuters, citing an unidentified government source, reported that Mr. Blankfein had hired Mr. Weingarten. Mr. Weingarten has defended Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and Mike Espy, a former agriculture secretary. Goldman’s stock price quickly tumbled, falling to its lowest level since March 2009. Its shares closed at 106.51. The stock move also reflected the support Goldman shareholders had for Mr. Blankfein despite the problems the firm’s problems under his stewardship. At Goldman’s stakeholder meeting in May, shareholders voted 97 percent in favor of his leadership. Any suggestion that Mr. Blankfein’s legal woes were mounting, or that he might leave the firm, would be seen as a negative for the stock. Goldman investors have been on a roller-coaster ride since April 2010, when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman of duping clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly created by a hedge fund firm to cash in on the housing market’s collapse. Since then, it has been dogged by investigations and speculation about investigations, all of which have taken its toll on stock. Goldman shares were trading near 180 a share before the S.E.C. filed its lawsuit. Goldman settled that suit a few months later, but its troubles were far from over. This year came the Senate report, which led to a Justice Department inquiry. And in June, Goldman received a subpoena from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, which is also investigating Goldman’s role in the financial crisis. Mr. Blankfein’s decision to hire his own lawyer is not unusual. Legal experts say that it is now common for a company’s chief executive to retain separate counsel from the corporation. It has become rare for a lawyer or law firm to represent both a company and its executives in a government investigation. Mr. Weingarten, 61, is considered a skilled trial lawyer, having won acquittals for Mr. Espy, the former agriculture secretary, and Mark A. Belnick, the former general counsel at Tyco. He has also suffered his share of courtroom defeats. Mr. Ebbers, the head of WorldCom, was found guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. On Monday, Mr. Weingarten was in the Federal District Court in Manhattan with his client Anthony Cuti, the former chief executive of Duane Reade, the drugstore chain. A judge sentenced Mr. Cuti to three years in prison for a scheme to falsely inflate the income and reduce the expense that the company reported. A jury convicted Mr. Cuti in June 2010. Mr. Weingarten did not respond to request for comment on Monday. A spokeswoman for his law firm, Steptoe & Johnson, declined to comment. Steptoe is not the firm most closely associated with Goldman. The bank’s primary outside law firm is Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent and old-line New York law firm. Sullivan represented the firm in its 550 million settlement with the S.E.C. Also, when Mr. Blankfein testified as a witness earlier this year in the insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the former hedge fund manager, lawyers from Sullivan coached him on his testimony and accompanied him to court. A native of Newark, Mr. Weingarten is a graduate of Cornell and the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State. Before becoming a criminal defense lawyer, he spent several years as a deputy district attorney in Pennsylvania and then joined the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section. While at the Justice Department, he spent years bringing cases against corrupt politicians and worked with another young prosecutor, Eric H. Holder. Mr. Holder, now the attorney general of the United States, remains one of Mr. Weingarten’s closest friends. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has hired high-profile Washington defense attorney Reid Weingarten as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank and its role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

I will also analyze different types of participatory democracy to show how they contribute positively to the trust in politics. Step 1: Documented case studies I will search for well-documented case studies that showcase the successful implementation of participatory democratic practices and their impact on trust in politics. Some examples include participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and citizen assemblies in Ontario, Canada. These case studies can provide evidence of increased transparency, citizen empowerment, and improved trust in political institutions. Step 2: Survey data I will collect survey data that measures public trust in politics before and after the implementation of participatory democratic practices. This data can help establish a correlation between participatory democracy and increased trust in political institutions. The Eurobarometer and World Values Survey are two potential sources for this data. Step 3: Academic research I will review academic research on participatory democracy and trust in politics. This research can provide a theoretical understanding of how participatory democratic practices can improve trust in political institutions. I will analyze studies about the effects of increased political participation, transparency, and responsiveness on overall trust in politics. I will also look for research focusing on how technology can facilitate participatory democracy and how it can enhance trust in politics. Step 4: Types of participatory democracy I will analyze different types of participatory democracy, such as participatory budgeting, deliberative democracy, e-democracy, and citizen assemblies, to showcase how each contributes to restore trust in politics. By presenting diverse examples, I can provide compelling evidence of how participatory democracy methods vary in approach but share the common goal of improving trust in political institutions. Step 5: Contrast with representative democracy To further support the claim, I will compare participatory democracy to representative democracy. By identifying the limitations of the latter, such as the lack of direct citizen input and potential for corruption, I can show how participatory democracy offers a viable alternative that enhances transparency, responsiveness, and overall trust in political institutions. By following these steps, I can build a strong body of evidence to support the claim that participatory forms of democracy can restore trust in politics. These examples and data will showcase the potential of participatory practices in improving transparency, empowering citizens, and ultimately creating a more trusting relationship between the people and political institutions."},{"question":"Same meaning?

Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing either of the two main parties' candidates (McCain - Republican Party, or Obama - Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the \\"charade\\" that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process.

The answer is:","response":"Yes, the right answer to the question \\"what causes thermal expansion?\\" can indeed be attributed to \\"kinetic energy\\" as one of the key factors, given that the movement of molecules plays a significant role in this phenomenon. However, to provide a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of thermal expansion, it is important to delve deeper into the underlying concepts and mechanisms at work. Thermal expansion is the process by which matter (such as solids, liquids, or gases) expands or contracts when their temperature changes. When a substance is heated, its constituent particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) gain kinetic energy, which results in an increase in their average speed and motion. These particles have a natural tendency to vibrate, rotate, or move due to the intrinsic energy they possess. As the kinetic energy of these particles increases with temperature, they start to occupy more space due to the greater average distance between them, leading to an increase in the volume of the substance. In the case of solids, thermal expansion is mainly caused by the increase in vibrational motion of the constituent atoms or molecules. When heated, these particles vibrate more vigorously, causing the average distance between them to increase. In turn, this leads to the expansion of the solid's lattice structure, subsequently resulting in a macroscopic increase in size. For liquids, the mechanism of thermal expansion is similar, yet slightly different. As the molecules in a liquid gain kinetic energy upon heating, they move faster and spread out, overcoming some of the intermolecular forces that hold them together. This increased molecular motion leads to an increase in the average distance between the liquid's molecules, causing the liquid's volume to expand. Gases, on the other hand, exhibit a more noticeable thermal expansion compared to solids and liquids. Gas molecules, when heated, not only vibrate more intensely but also move at much higher speeds. This increased molecular motion overcomes the weak intermolecular forces acting on the gas particles, thereby causing the gas to expand considerably as the temperature increases. In conclusion, one can consider kinetic energy as an appropriate answer for the cause of thermal expansion, given that the increased motion of particles due to the increase in their kinetic energy leads to the observed expansion in the macroscopic scale. However, it is important to consider the details and underlying mechanisms at play, such as vibrational motion in solids and the overcoming of intermolecular forces in liquids and gases, to have a well-rounded understanding of thermal expansion."},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Speed (in m/s) = (90 * 1000) / 3600 Speed (in m/s) = 90000 / 3600 Speed (in m/s) = 25 m/s Now, we can use the formula to calculate the length of the train: Length of the train = Speed × Time Length of the train = 25 m/s × 6 seconds Length of the train = 150 meters Therefore, the length of the train is 150 meters, and the correct option is (A) 150 meters."},{"question":"Do these questions have the same meaning? What are the last names of Greek, Roman and Norse gods? What happened to Greek, Roman & Norse gods?","response":"No, these two questions have different meanings and ask for distinct information on Greek, Roman, and Norse gods. Let's look at both questions separately: 1. What are the last names of Greek, Roman, and Norse gods? This question is asking for the last names or surnames associated with deities from three different mythological pantheons: Greek, Roman, and Norse. However, it is important to clarify that gods and goddesses in ancient mythologies generally did not have last names like we do today. For context, here is a brief overview of some major gods and goddesses from each pantheon: Greek mythology: - Zeus: King of the gods and god of the sky, lightning, and thunder - Hera: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, family, and childbirth - Poseidon: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses Roman mythology: - Jupiter: King of the gods and god of the sky, thunder, and lightning - Juno: Queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, childbirth, and family - Neptune: God of the sea, earthquakes, and horses Norse mythology: - Odin: The All-Father, chief of the Aesir, and god of wisdom, war, and poetry - Thor: God of thunder, lightning, storms, and strength - Freyja: Goddess of love, beauty, fertility, and war In mythology, one might argue that gods and goddesses have epithets rather than last names. Epithets are descriptive phrases or terms given to deities to describe their attributes, actions, or roles within their mythology and religion. For example, Zeus is referred to as \\"Zeus Olympios\\" (Zeus of Olympus) or \\"Zeus Xenios\\" (Zeus of hospitality). These epithets provide a form of identification and characteristics, but they are not last names. 2. What happened to Greek, Roman, and Norse gods? This question is seeking information about the historical and cultural development of these three mythological pantheons as well as their influence and transformation over time. Greek gods: The Greek gods were widely worshipped and followed by the ancient Greeks. As time passed and Christianity spread, the influence of Greek gods began to fade. During the Roman Empire, Greek gods were often incorporated into Roman culture and adopted new identities and characteristics. Ultimately, as Roman polytheism declined and Christianity gained prominence, worship and belief in Greek gods diminished further. Roman gods: Initially, the Romans had their gods and followed the traditional beliefs of their ancestors. As the Roman Empire expanded and came into contact with Greek civilization, they adopted many of the Greek deities, attributing Roman names and identities to them. The rise of Christianity and the eventual adoption of Christianity as the state religion by Emperor Constantine I in the early 4th century AD led to the decline of Roman polytheism. Norse gods: The Norse gods were integral to the religious practices and beliefs of the ancient Norse people. As various Northern European regions, such as Scandinavia and other regions inhabited by Germanic tribes, came into contact with Christianity, conversion began to take place. By the end of the Viking Age (around 11th century AD) and the continued spread of Christianity, Norse polytheism saw a decline, and worship and belief in Norse gods dissipated and became part of folklore, legends, and stories. In summary, while the two questions are related to Greek, Roman, and Norse deities, they are indeed asking for different information. The first question focuses on identifying the last names of these gods, whereas the second question seeks historical context on the evolution and decline of these mythological pantheons."},{"question":"Q:David Halvorson - David Philip Halvorson (July 9 1948 – July 1 2013) was an American politician.Born in Sidney Montana Halvorson graduated from Williston High School in Williston North Dakota.

Arkansas is situated in the south-central region of the United States, characterized by a humid subtropical climate, which experiences significant temperature changes and precipitation throughout the year, leading to multiple seasons such as spring, summer, fall, and winter. The Earth's axial tilt, approximately 23.5 degrees, is a critical factor responsible for the change of seasons. As our planet revolves around the sun, the tilt of its axis results in different parts of the Earth receiving varying amounts of sunlight during its orbit. In the case of Arkansas, this varying amount of sunlight creates distinct characteristics for each season observed throughout the year. 1. Spring: In Arkansas, spring usually extends from March to May. During this period, the Earth's axis is tilting towards the sun, leading to an increase in daylight hours. Consequently, temperatures begin to rise after winter and reach an average high of about 60 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Springtime in Arkansas is known for its moderate temperatures, ample rainfall, and blooming flora, making it an ideal time for outdoor activities and farming. However, the state is no stranger to severe weather outbreaks during spring, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, and hailstorms, due to the convergence of warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico and cooler air from the north. 2. Summer: Summer in Arkansas typically lasts from June to August. During this period, the Earth's tilt is at its maximum towards the sun in the Northern Hemisphere, causing the days to be longer and temperatures to rise significantly. Average high temperatures in Arkansas reach the upper 80s to low 90s degrees Fahrenheit, with high levels of humidity contributing to a sweltering climate. While this can be an excellent time for outdoor recreational activities such as swimming, camping, and barbecues, it is also a period of potential heatwaves, droughts, and occasional thunderstorms. 3. Fall (Autumn): The fall season in Arkansas spans from September to November. As the Earth's axial tilt moves away from the sun, the amount of daylight decreases, and temperatures subsequently drop. Averaging between the 50s to 70s degrees Fahrenheit, fall temperatures in Arkansas are generally mild and comfortable. Leaves changing colors and falling off from deciduous trees is a distinct feature of this season, creating picturesque landscapes in the state. This season also brings moderate rainfall, providing much-needed water for plants and animals before the onset of winter. Additionally, cooler temperatures and decreased humidity levels lower the risk of severe weather outbreaks, making autumn a favorable time for outdoor activities, such as hiking and wildlife observation. 4. Winter: Lasting from December until February, the winter season in Arkansas is marked by the Earth's axial tilt being at its most considerable distance from the sun in the Northern Hemisphere. As a result, daylight hours are shorter, and temperatures drop significantly as compared to other seasons. Arkansas typically experiences average high temperatures in the upper 40s to lower 50s degrees Fahrenheit during winter, with overnight lows occasionally dipping below freezing. While snowfall is not uncommon in the state, especially in the northwest region, it rarely accumulates to significant levels. Winter can be a time for various cold-weather activities, such as skiing and ice fishing, but it also brings potential hazards like frost, ice, and freezing rain, which can impact transportation, agriculture, and outdoor activities. In conclusion, Arkansas experiences multiple seasons mainly because of its geographical position and the way Earth's axial tilt influences climate on a regional level. These varying seasonal conditions create opportunities for diverse outdoor activities and influence the state's agriculture, wildlife, and other ecosystems."},{"question":"Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Plus is an Android smartphone produced by Samsung Electronics.

After learning the basics of cake baking from Sydney, it is natural for Carson to be eager to try their new skills on their own. The process of learning from someone and then applying the gained knowledge is what helps solidify the information and gives a better understanding of the task at hand.

This came about after a series of ownership changes throughout the years. Let's take a closer look at the transition of ownership that led to Cumulus Media owning WKY's radio division. Oklahoma City's WKY Radio has a rich history as a pioneer in radio and television broadcasting. Established in 1921, WKY holds the distinction of being the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States. The station began broadcasting under the same call letters in 1922, and in 1928, it was acquired by E.K. Gaylord's Oklahoma Publishing Company. At that time, WKY became affiliated with the NBC Red Network. In 1949, WKY took a significant step in broadcasting history by launching WKY-TV (channel 4), which later became the first independently owned television station in the United States to broadcast in color. The radio and television divisions went their separate ways in 1976 when the Gaylord family sold WKY-TV; however, WKY Radio remained under the ownership of the Oklahoma Publishing Company. The WKY radio division saw a significant change in ownership in mid-2002 when Citadel Broadcasting purchased the station outright. Citadel Broadcasting was a significant player in the radio industry, and its acquisition of WKY added to its growing portfolio of radio stations across the country. The ownership landscape shifted again in 2011 when Cumulus Media Inc., another major broadcasting company, acquired Citadel Broadcasting in a deal worth 2.4 billion. This acquisition made Cumulus the second-largest operator of radio stations in the United States, and it brought WKY Radio under the Cumulus umbrella. As part of Cumulus Media, WKY Radio continues to be a significant presence in the Oklahoma City market. Cumulus Media owns and operates radio stations in many other markets across the country, making it a significant player in the industry. In conclusion, after a series of acquisitions and sale transactions, Cumulus Media Inc. currently owns WKY's radio division as a result of its acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting in 2011."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Disconnects without warning Occasionally drops connection without notifying which is a huge risk!

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV. - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands.

Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry.

Here are possible answers to this question: - go crazy - cool air - hot shower - come in many sizes - cool room I believe the correct choice is \\"go crazy\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"The most appropriate answer among the given options is indeed \\"go crazy\\". This is because the experience of meeting their idol can provoke an overwhelming sense of excitement, joy, and awe in fans. The term \\"go crazy\\" encapsulates the intense emotions fans may feel during such encounters. Below is a detailed analysis of why this choice is the most accurate: 1. Emotional significance: Meeting one's idol can be a dream come true for many fans. They hold their idols in high esteem, and often these celebrities inspire and motivate them in various aspects of their lives. Hence, being able to meet a person who has made a significant impact on their lives would likely elicit an intense emotional reaction. 2. Surprise and disbelief: Fans may experience a sense of disbelief or surrealism upon encountering their favorite celebrity. This can be a major contributing factor to their sense of excitement and exhilaration, as they struggle to come to terms with the fact that they are in the presence of someone they have long admired from afar. 3. Release of endorphins: Excitement and happiness release endorphins, which are hormones that work as natural mood elevators. This release of endorphins can, in turn, contribute to the heightened state of euphoria that fans could experience when meeting their idol. 4. The idol's response: The demeanor and interaction of the celebrity can also play a significant role in shaping the fan's reaction. A warm, friendly, and engaging attitude from the idol can further intensify the fan's sense of awe and excitement. 5. Social media and sharing experiences: In the age of social media, fans are eager to share their experiences meeting their idols, often posting photos and videos online. This can compound their excitement, as they show off and recount their memorable encounters to friends and fellow fans. In contrast, the other options provided, such as \\"cool air,\\" \\"hot shower,\\" \\"come in many sizes,\\" and \\"cool room,\\" do not effectively capture the essence of a fan's reaction upon meeting their idol. These phrases may refer to various situations or sensations but bear little relevance to the fan-idol dynamic. Therefore, in the context of describing a fan's reaction to meeting their idol, the most suitable choice remains \\"go crazy.\\""}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.response&&e.response.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function j(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
