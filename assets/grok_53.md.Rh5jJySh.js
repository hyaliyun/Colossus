Step 1: Define 'substantiate' The word \\"substantiate\\" generally means to provide evidence to support or prove the truth of something, or to give concrete form or reality to an abstract idea or concept. Step 2: Analyze the use of 'substantiate' in the first sentence. In the sentence \\"The president's trip will substantiate good relations with the former enemy country,\\" the word 'substantiate' is used to imply that the president's visit will provide evidence or proof that there are indeed good relations between the two countries. In this context, 'substantiate' refers to providing validation or confirmation of the claim that the relations between the countries have improved. Step 3: Analyze the use of 'substantiate' in the second sentence. In the sentence \\"The painting substantiates the feelings of the artist,\\" the word 'substantiate' is used to indicate that the painting gives concrete form or reality to the artist's emotions or ideas. The painting serves as evidence or manifestation of the artist's feelings. Conclusion: In both sentences, the word \\"substantiate\\" refers to providing evidence or giving concrete form to something. However, the focus is slightly different in each case. In the first sentence, 'substantiate' refers to validating or confirming a claim about improved relations between countries. In the second sentence, 'substantiate' refers to giving tangible expression to an artist's feelings.

The first serious attempt of the Ottoman government to suppress the revolt resulted with the Battle of Deçiq. Terenzio Tocci gathered the Mirdite chieftains on 26 April 1911 in Orosh, proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the flag of Albania and established the provisional government. Shefqet Turgut Pasha wanted to meet this threat and returned to the region with 8.000 soldiers. As soon as he reached Shkodër on 11 May, he issued a general proclamation which declared martial law and offered an amnesty for all rebels if they immediately return to their homes. After Ottoman troops entered the area Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities. On 14 May, three days after his poclamation, Shefqet Turgut Pasha ordered his troops to seize Dečić, hill that overlooked Tuzi. Sixty Albanian chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation on their meeting in Podgorica on 18 May. After almost a month of intense fightings rebels were trapped and their only choices were either to die fighting, to surrender or to flee to Montenegro. Most of the rebels chose to flee to Montenegro which became a base for large number of rebels determined to attack the Ottoman Empire. Ismail Kemal Bey and Tiranli Cemal bey traveled from Italy to Montenegro at the end of May and met the rebels to convince them to adopt the nationalistic agenda which they eventually did.

The Power of Nature's Sounds Lawson's video features the soothing sounds of a waterfall under a footbridge along the River Bonet in Ireland. This seemingly simple video has captivated viewers with its calming effect, keeping them engaged for hours. People from all over the world, including the Vatican, reached out to Lawson expressing how his videos have helped improve their mental health and general well-being. The extraordinary impact of Lawson's video lies in the power of nature's sounds. Natural sounds, such as the gentle flow of water or rustling leaves, have a calming effect on the human brain. These sounds help relax the mind, consequently reducing stress levels, anxiety, and insomnia. The power of nature's sounds has been further supported by several London hospitals, which are using Lawson's videos for medical research. Using Nature's Sounds in Medical Research London's University College Hospital is conducting a trial focusing on reducing trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Lawson's video, along with other relaxation materials, is integrated into the patients' recovery process. Tablets provide access to his catalog of sounds and images taken from the woods and shorelines of County Leitrim. The goal of this trial is to determine whether incorporating nature's calming sounds into recovery plans could improve patients' mental health and overall well-being. Johnnie Lawson's Collection Lawson has a collection of over 170 videos featuring natural scenes and sounds. Initially, viewers would fall asleep to his shorter videos but would wake up in the middle of the night due to the sudden silence. This led Lawson to create eight-hour-long videos, allowing viewers uninterrupted rest throughout the night. The beneficial impact of his videos has brought Lawson an appreciative and loyal viewership. Inspirational Sayings and Future Applications Lawson also posts peaceful and inspirational sayings on his Facebook page, further demonstrating his commitment to promoting relaxation and mental well-being. He shares phrases like \\"Under a warming evening sun, a gentle breeze caresses still waters.\\" These comforting messages add to the tranquility evoked by his videos and reinforce the healing power of connecting with nature. Conclusion Johnnie Lawson's waterfall video has had a surprisingly immense impact on insomniacs and relaxation seekers worldwide. The soothing influence of nature's sounds featured in his video offers solace to those struggling with mental health issues. The fact that medical research is actively studying the effects of these sounds on patient recovery further validates the power of the natural world in fostering well-being.

Russ bought a telescope to view the planet but he couldn't see the star because the Choose your answer from: (A). star was closer.. (B). planet was closer..","response":"Russ bought a telescope to view the planet but he couldn't see the star because the planet was closer. To better understand this situation, it is important to delve into the workings of a telescope and how celestial objects are observed through it. Telescopes are specialized pieces of optical equipment designed for magnifying and observing distant objects, such as celestial bodies, in the night sky. A key feature of a telescope is its ability to gather light, the more light it can collect, the better the image's detail and brightness. The primary component of a telescope is a lens or a mirror, which collects, focuses, and directs light toward the eyepiece where it can be observed or captured. The distance between celestial bodies can affect the capability of a telescope to see them clearly. In this case, the planet was closer to Russ's location than the star. This could have been the result of several factors that ultimately hindered his ability to see the star. Let's explore some of these possibilities. 1. Brightness and Magnitude: Planets can sometimes appear brighter and larger in a telescope than stars due to their relative proximity, which can make them easier to find and observe. As a result, planets can \\"overshadow\\" or mask the visibility of dimmer stars located near them. 2. Skyglow and Light Pollution: Artificial light from cities and towns can drown out the fainter light of distant stars, making them difficult or impossible to see with a telescope. Sky glow occurs when the sky appears to be brighter due to particles in the atmosphere scattering artificial light, making it more challenging to see distant stars, particularly those positioned near bright planets. 3. Telescope Limitations: Some telescopes may be better suited for specific types of observing, and the telescope Russ bought might not have been optimal for looking at the star he was interested in. Variables such as aperture size, focal length, and eyepiece selection can all influence what a telescope is best suited for viewing. 4. Atmospheric Effects: The Earth's atmosphere and changing weather conditions can hinder the visibility of celestial objects. Turbulence, humidity, and airborne particles can all have negative effects on the quality of the image formed in the telescope. While Russ was able to view the closer planet, he may still be able to find the star he wishes to observe by using a different approach. He can attempt to view the star on a night where the planet is no longer in proximity or not as visible, improve his viewing conditions by finding a location with less light pollution, or adapt his telescope setup to better suit his needs for star observing. In the future, Russ can also benefit from learning more about star charts, celestial coordinates, and understanding the best observing techniques for his specific telescope. With this knowledge, he can enhance his stargazing experience and potentially avoid the issue he encountered with the closer planet obstructing his view of the star."},{"question":"Translate \\"The FBI is curious why the Las Vegas-based Linderman Group would be so interested in helping a New York candidate.\\" to Czech?","response":"To translate the given sentence into Czech, I will follow these steps: 1.

The focus here is solely on pimples, which are inflamed bumps on the skin with a white or yellow pus-filled center. 2. How do I get rid of acne and its spots? This question encompasses a broader range of concerns related to acne and its aftermath. Acne is a skin condition that manifests in various forms such as blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. While pimples are a type of acne, this question also addresses other acne types. Additionally, the inclusion of \\"its spots\\" implies concern for post-acne marks and hyperpigmentation that can result from acne, regardless of the specific type.

But it’s part of both a larger assault on the traditional function of the media by the Obama administration, as well as a broader government intrusion into the privacy of U.S. citizens. Under Obama, the government has pursued six cases against individuals suspected of handing over classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined, as the Associated Press pointed out. Meanwhile, disturbing news about the government’s ability and willingness to use electronic surveillance on Americans has continued to mount. It adds up to a chilling effect on citizens, journalists and potential whistleblowers, who rightly now must think twice about offering information concerning government misdeeds or secrets. That comes at an incredibly high cost for society. Whatever you think of the modern press — and I’ve got plenty of problems with it myself — it serves a critical function in bringing government wrongdoing out into the open. It holds officials, police and the military accountable for their actions in a way that nothing else can. It’s in our national interest to protect the media’s use of confidential sources, because too often people can only be honest and open about such matters under the cloak of anonymity. The Justice Department hasn’t provided details about its investigation that ensnared the Associated Press, but it appears to be related to a story the news wire published in May 2012 revealing the Central Intelligence Agency successfully thwarted an al-Qaida plot to blow up a United States-bound airliner. The Justice Department seems to have obtained records of outgoing calls for the work, personal and cell phone numbers of a handful of Associated Press reporters, including the ones involved in that story. The records also included calls coming from the general AP office numbers in several cities. So far, it doesn’t seem the conversations themselves were monitored. The Justice Department’s own rules require that subpoenas for the telephone records of journalists be as narrowly drawn as possible, and sought only after all other possibilities for finding the information it’s seeking are exhausted. The first clearly didn’t happen; the details concerning the second part are still unclear. “There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,” wrote Associated Press Chief Executive Gary Pruitt in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. “These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the news gathering activities undertaken by the A.P. during a two-month period, provide a road map to A.P.’s news gathering operations, and disclose information about A.P.’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.” Even if you’re not outraged by the government’s latest intrusion into the privacy of the press, consider its ongoing intrusions into your own. In the years since the terrorist attack of 9/11, the United States has edged ever closer to a surveillance state, as the National Security Agency engaged in warrantless wiretapping and eavesdropped in secret rooms at the switching centers of AT&T and others. Using open records requests, the ACLU last year found that police departments routinely track personal cell phones, often without warrants. A subsequent congressional inquiry found that cellular carriers responded to at least 1.3 million such requests for subscriber records last year, a notable increase based on carriers that provided figures from earlier years. Also in 2012, Wired reported that the NSA is building a massive, 2 billion data center in Utah to mine and analyze vast amounts of personal data and communications crisscrossing the Internet. “Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private e-mails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails — parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital ‘pocket litter,’ ” the magazine reported. “It is, in some measure, the realization of the ‘total information awareness’ program created during the first term of the Bush administration — an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans’ privacy.” A former FBI counterterrorism agent divulged even more shocking information earlier this month. Tim Clemente was asked in a CNN interview whether the government could review earlier telephone conversations between the late Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his widow, Katherine Russell, to determine if she had any involvement in the crime. “There is a way,” he said. “We certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation. It’s not necessarily something that the FBI is going to want to present in court, but it may help lead the investigation.” “All of that stuff,” he continued after the next question, “is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not.” That seems to suggest that the government can record or access recordings all of our phone calls. It sounds far-fetched; it sounds downright Orwellian. But I, for one, would certainly like to know if it’s true. That strikes me as a far bigger crime — and something much more worthy of an aggressive investigation — than a phone call between a government staffer and a reporter.","response":"This news article talks about how the US government, under the Obama administration, secretly took the private phone records of some reporters from the Associated Press.

Mary poured the entire bottle of cleaning soap into the sink until the OPTIONS: (I) bottle was full. (II) sink was full.","response":"(II) sink was full. As the sink filled with foamy bubbles and the faint scent of lemon, Mary couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. This was her first deep cleaning of the old house since her grandmother passed away, an undertaking she knew would be both emotionally and physically challenging. In the few years leading up to her grandmother's passing, their once-beloved family home had slowly transformed into a disorganized heap of memories. Mary had been her grandmother's sole caregiver during her prolonged illness, and upon her death, the house became Mary's responsibility. Despite the clutter and the mess, Mary was determined to restore the home to its former glory in honor of her grandmother's spirited and nurturing care. As Mary scrubbed at the accumulated grime in the kitchen, she uncovered hidden gems that brought back warm and comforting memories. Her grandmother's old cooking utensils, the dishes they shared in her childhood, and the scented candles that would fill the air with sweet smells during the holiday season were all lovingly recovered from the chaos. With each cleansed item, the memories continued to pour into Mary's heart. In the living room, Mary discovered her grandmother's tattered photo album brimming with images of days past, family celebrations, and glimpses into the life of a woman whose spirit was far greater than anyone who knew her could understand. She sat down upon the worn couch, the scent of lavender wafting through from the open kitchen window, and began to flip through the pages. There, amongst faces of those long gone, were old pictures of her grandparents, her mother in her youth, and images of many cherished holidays spent gathered around the hearth. The relic contained a mixture of kept secrets and shared moments, its unveiling bringing a nostalgic wellspring to Mary's eyes. Despite the emotional toll, Mary pressed on with her mission. In her grandmother's bedroom, she pored over old letters and keepsakes that had been squirreled away over a lifetime of treasured friendships. It was here that she found an old journal, the intricately designed leather-bound cover inviting her to take a peek into her grandmother's mind. Unable to resist, she began to read in hushed tones as though her grandmother's voice were whispering the softly inscribed words to her. The journal contained tales of love, loss, triumph, and heartache, all coming together like the interwoven threads of a priceless lace. As Mary read about her grandmother's courage, seeking opportunities and challenges despite the cultural constraints of her times, she became more in awe of the resilient woman she knew and loved. Mary continued her cleaning, feeling empowered and connected to her grandmother's spirit. Each room held a new depth of memories that she uncovered and treasured. In the living room, she found her mother's old records and remembered dancing to the rhythmic beats of the '60s that surrounded her youth. In her grandmother's sewing room, she ran her fingers over the beautifully hand-crafted quilts and lace curtains that adorned the walls, recognizing the artistry and care that went into every stitch. As the weeks went by, the house was gradually returned to its former splendor. The dust, grime, and clutter were replaced by an atmosphere of serene elegance, a space where memories could rest and new ones could be made. The old foundation breathed a sigh of collective relief as though thanking Mary for her loving attention to detail. And with her grandmother's voice accompanying each step of the transformation, Mary no longer felt alone. In the process of restoring this once beaming home, a new bond with the home and her grandmother emerged, one that transcended the physical realm. Each time Mary looked around her grandmother's house, she was reminded of the strength and love that had filled its rooms. The space had once again become a sanctuary where family and friends could gather to laugh, cry, and cherish the moments that life had to offer. For Mary, the greatest gift that her grandmother's house possessed was the ability to connect generations, whispering the tales of those who came before and reminding her of the beauty and grace of the human spirit."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?

A Neanderthal man stumbles upon what appears to be a large, primal, vicious alien in a cave (although the camera work uses zooms and flash-edits to keep the creature from being visualized fully). The two fight, and the caveman wins, stabbing the alien to death. However, fans of the show will recognize the black oil as it bleeds from the alien's wounds and soaks into the Neanderthal. After a fade to modern-day small-town Texas, a little boy (Lucas Black) falls down a hole in his back yard, and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground beneath his feet, and black slivers move up his legs until they reach his head - his eyes go black. Shortly afterward, a team of firemen descend to rescue him. They are presumably lost to the same fate as the boy.In the summer of 1998, at the end of the show's fifth season, the X-Files were shut down, and Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were assigned to other projects. They are first seen assisting Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Darius Michaud (Terry O'Quinn), and his FBI team investigating a bomb threat to a Federal building in Dallas, Texas. When Mulder separates from the team to scout out the building across the street, he discovers the bomb in a first-floor vending machine. While Michaud remains to disarm the bomb, Mulder and Scully are able to evacuate the building and prevent hundreds of casualties before it explodes.

Science/Tech Answer:","response":"The text provided is about a situation in the business realm, specifically focusing on military contracting. Hence, the correct selection is (3). Business. To elaborate, the text details a situation where Halliburton Co., a big American corporation that delivers multiple services, especially to the energy sector, has been unable to accurately account for all its expenses while providing support to U.S. troops in Iraq. The Pentagon, United States' Department of Defense's headquarters, seems to have lost hope in Halliburton's capability of providing a complete and transparent account of the money spent in these operations. An \\"accounting armistice\\" in this context likely implies that the Pentagon is considering reaching a settlement, where they may possibly forego the need for complete accounting from Haliburton in a bid to resolve the issue. The main concern, as highlighted by the text, seems to be a lack of financial transparency and accountability in relation to a business contract between a governmental body and the private sector. Such situations often arise in the complex world of business, where large corporations work alongside governmental bodies to provide infrastructure, utilities, goods, and services. These corporations are held accountable for their management of funds, especially when the funds originate from taxpayers' money.

A: Answer:","response":"Accessory digestive organs play a vital role in the process of breaking down food substances, enabling the body to extract essential nutrients and dispose of waste products effectively. These organs include the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, each contributing to different stages of digestion and absorption. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of each accessory organ's functionality and the substances they play a role in breaking down: 1. Salivary glands: The salivary glands are specialized exocrine glands located in the oral cavity, responsible for producing and secreting saliva. Saliva contains various enzymes and substances critical for breaking down food. The primary enzyme present in saliva is amylase, which breaks down complex carbohydrates, such as starch, into simpler sugars like maltose. Additionally, saliva provides lubrication to facilitate the swallowing of food and contains lysozyme, an enzyme that helps protect against bacterial infections in the oral cavity. 2. Liver: The liver is a vital organ responsible for producing bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that is critical for the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile consists of bile acids, which breakdown large fat globules into smaller droplets. These smaller droplets increase the surface area for lipase, a fat-digesting enzyme, allowing it to function more effectively. Moreover, the liver also has essential roles in processing and storing nutrients, detoxifying harmful substances, and synthesizing blood proteins. 3. Gallbladder: The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver. It stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver before releasing it into the small intestine when required. The concentrated bile emulsifies fats in the small intestine, which is vital for their breakdown and efficient absorption. Essentially, the gallbladder's function is to regulate the release of bile and support the liver's role in fat digestion. 4. Pancreas: The pancreas is a multifunctional organ that secretes pancreatic juice, containing digestive enzymes and bicarbonate ions. Pancreatic amylase is responsible for breaking down carbohydrates into disaccharides, trypsin, and chymotrypsin for breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, and lipase for breaking down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Additionally, the pancreas produces hormones like insulin and glucagon, both of which are vital for regulating blood sugar levels. In summary, accessory digestive organs like the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas produce and secrete substances that are critical for breaking down various food components. These components include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, enabling the body to utilize essential nutrients effectively and eliminate waste products."},{"question":"Please answer a question about the following article about Federalism: In modern times, a process of devolution in the United Kingdom has decentralised power once again.

Government has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. England does not have its own parliament and English affairs continue to be decided by the Westminster Parliament. In 1998 a set of eight unelected Regional assemblies, or chambers, was created to support the English Regional Development Agencies, but these were abolished between 2008 and 2010. The Regions of England continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions. What does the region of England continue to use?","response":"The region of England continues to use the \\"Regions of England\\" as a structure for certain governmental administrative functions. Following the abolishment of the eight unelected Regional Assemblies (or chambers) between 2008 and 2010, the regions themselves have persisted as a means of organizing various administrative tasks at a more local level within England. These Regions of England, also sometimes referred to as \\"Government Office Regions,\\" serve as an organizational framework for coordinating various government programs and initiatives within specific geographic areas. Although the Regional Assemblies no longer exist, the regions still play an important role in various aspects of governance and administration, such as regional planning, implementing national policies at a local level, and coordinating responses to issues that impact the regions. The current Regions of England include: 1. North East England 2. North West England 3. Yorkshire and the Humber 4. East Midlands 5. West Midlands 6. East of England 7. London 8. South East England 9. South West England By compartmentalizing England into these regions, the government can better address the specific needs and requirements of each area. This helps to facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources and ensures that local matters are dealt with more effectively. It is important to note that while these Regions of England are used for administrative purposes, they do not possess the same level of autonomy as the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In England, decision-making power predominantly remains with the UK Parliament in Westminster.

Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state.

The Mod movement was marked by its signature fashion sense, musical preferences, and social attitudes, which set it apart from other subcultures during that period. Mods were known for their impeccable and sharp fashion choices. The Crombie overcoat, an elegant and luxurious garment, became a beloved staple in their wardrobe. Made from the finest and warmest wool, the Crombie overcoat featured a three-quarter length design, straight collar, and concealed front buttoning. This coat lent an air of sophistication and was often worn over tailored suits, which represented the Mods' taste for clean lines and streamlined silhouettes. Additionally, the Harrington jacket was another iconic piece cherished by Mods. Known for its versatility and sports-inspired design, the Harrington jacket featured a short length, relaxed fit, and a standing collar with a characteristic button and tab. With slanted front pockets, elasticated bands around the waist and cuffs, this lightweight jacket provided a more casual layering option for Mods to style over their well-fitted polo shirts, button-downs, or knitted sweaters. Fashion was not the only aspect that defined the Mod movement. The Mods' penchant for music was another distinctive trait. They embraced modern jazz, rhythm and blues, soul, and, eventually, British and American rock bands like The Rolling Stones, The Small Faces, and The Who. They frequented nightclubs, such as the famous Marquee Club in London, to express their individuality and passion for music and dancing. As a subculture, the Mod movement also had its own set of social attitudes and behaviors. Mods were known for their obsession with appearing cool, detached, and somewhat mysterious. They aspired to be trendsetters, both in fashion and in their approach to life. This pursuit of modernity and attention to detail extended to their choice of transportation, with many Mods famously riding Vespa or Lambretta scooters adorned with multiple mirrors, lights, and other customizations. In summary, the Mod movement's beloved Crombie overcoats and Harrington jackets, along with its musical preferences and social attitudes, form a composite picture of a stylish and influential youth culture born during the late 1950s in London. The Mods' enduring impact can still be felt today, with its distinctive fashion, music, and legacy continuing to inspire new generations and subcultures around the world."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.

Movie title: The Proposition Movie plot: Set in the Australian outback in the 1880s, the movie follows the series of events following the horrific rape and murder of the Hopkins family, allegedly committed by the infamous Burns brothers gang.The film opens in a brothel during a violent gunfight between the police and Charlie Burns' (Guy Pearce) gang, which ends with the deaths of all of the gang members except for Charlie and his younger brother Mikey. Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes that Mikey is innocent and the flogging will surely kill him, but because it would also break his deal with Charlie and... A:","response":"Based on the movie plot summary provided for \\"The Proposition,\\" Sergeant Lawrence, played by Robert Morgan, seems to function as part of the police force under Captain Stanley. However, the military rank of Lawrence is not explicitly provided in the given information. To dive deeper into the historical context, in the 1880s in Australia, the police force and military were interconnected in some aspects. In a frontier setting like the Australian outback, the frameworks of policing and military often overlapped. Roles like Lawrence's were crucial in maintaining law and order in these harsh and difficult environments. Lawrence is depicted as a corrupt subordinate to Captain Stanley, but his exact role within the law enforcement structure is not clear. Often, these frontier forces were a mix of military officers, enlisted men, and locally hired hands. His title, \\"Sergeant,\\" is commonly associated with both police and military ranks, denoting a position of authority and responsibility. Regardless, the movie paints a morally complex picture, where the pursuit of justice often blends with personal desires and corrupt practices. As an investor, you might be particularly interested in how well this character, Sergeant Lawrence, embodies these complexities of frontier law enforcement - a critical part in creating a captivating narrative. Nonetheless, to obtain detailed information regarding Lawrence's military position, additional data or access to the complete script might be required. Remember that understanding the roles and relationships of characters is crucial when evaluating a film's potential for success, as it directly relates to the narrative's depth, complexity, and appeal to audiences."},{"question":"La final, aş dori să adresez următoarea întrebare acelor state membre care susţin că din ce în ce mai puţini bani ar trebui să meargă la UE, dar care, în acelaşi timp, dau tot felul de noi priorităţi UE: dacă doriţi ca la UE să meargă mai puţini bani, care sunt priorităţile asupra cărora noi, ca UE, trebuie să lucrăm?

They claim that their researchâfunded primarily by tobacco companiesâhas found no definitive evidence of any linkage.

Now weary of battle, Maximus only desires to retire to his Spanish farm estate. But Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells him that his own son and heir, Commodus, is unfit to rule and appoints Maximus as regent to help save Rome from corruption. When the emperor reveals his plan to his son, Commodus murders him in a fit of rage. Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty. When the general refuses, he is arrested by his officers and is sentenced to death at dawn. He kills his captors and rides for his farm. However, he arrives too late to find it destroyed and his family murdered, under Commodus' orders. Maximus buries them and collapses from his wounds and grief. He is found by slavers who take him to Zucchabar, a colonia in the Roman North African province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to a lanista (gladiator trainer) named Proximo. Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators named Juba, a Numidian, and Hagan, a German. As he wins every match because of his military skills and indifference to death, he gains fame and recognition. But Proximo, who reveals that he himself was once a gladiator who fought well enough to be given his freedom, advises Maximus that being a good killer is not enough; a good gladiator is one who can \\"win the crowd\\".

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Mrs. Henderson Presents Movie plot: The film is based on the true story of the Windmill Theatre in London. Eccentric 70-year-old widow Mrs Laura Henderson purchases it as a post-widowhood hobby and appoints autocratic manager Vivian Van Damm. In 1937, they start a continuous variety revue called \\"Revudeville\\", but after other theatres in London copy this innovation, they begin losing money. Mrs Henderson suggests they add female nudity, similar to the Moulin Rouge in Paris, which is unprecedented in the United Kingdom. The Lord Chamberlain (Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer) reluctantly allows this under the condition that the nude performers remain immobile, so the performances can be considered art, the equivalent of nude statues in museums. Because the theatre's auditorium is below street level it is relatively safe during the bombing of London, and performances continue. The performers bravely go on with the show even during frightening bombing raids, and the posed nude girls resume their poses, after ducking, as the whole theatre is shaken and the scene flats all round them sway when a bomb lands close by. Maureen, one of the cast, becomes involved at Mrs Henderson's instigation with a young soldier, one of the audience regulars. Maureen becomes pregnant, is very upset about how it will affect her life, and hands in her notice. However, before the issue can be resolved, she is killed by a bomb while leaving the theatre. Other scenes depict life in the theatre during the period. Mrs Henderson and Mr Van Damm frequently clash and squabble, but also show great appreciation for each other. Eventually, the authorities want the theatre to close because of the danger of crowds gathering in the street outside the theatre. However, Mrs Henderson successfully argues: for soldiers going to die in the war this is their last chance, and for many of the young soldiers their only chance, to see female nudity.

According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by Solomon in his old age. (An alternative tradition that \\"Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote Isaiah, Proverbs, the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes\\" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah.) Nevertheless, critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin. The presence of Persian loan-words and Aramaisms points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE, while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when another Jewish writer, Ben Sira, quotes from it. The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the Persian or the Hellenistic periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of Hellenization (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450 -- 330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence; those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330 -- 180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.

At least 22 people died as a result of the heat wave that swept the nation earlier this summer, according to the National Weather Service. For 15 states, the average temperature ranked among their top 10 warmest, while overall, 46 of the lower 48 states saw average to above-average temperatures. Oregon and Washington were the only exceptions. Texas had the distinction of experiencing the warmest summer on record of any state in America, with an average of 86.8 degrees. Dallas residents sweltered for 40 consecutive days of grueling 100-plus degree temperatures. Oklahoma, at 86.5, also topped the previous record, of 85.2 degrees, set in Oklahoma in 1934, amid what became known as the Dust Bowl. For the month of August, Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas had their warmest in recorded history, while regionally, the Southwest and South also had their warmest August ever. Only nine of the lower 48 states saw August temperatures near their average readings, while none experienced below-average temperatures. Temperature-related energy demands soared more than 22% above the norm this summer, the largest increase since record-keeping of energy demands began more than a century ago, NOAA said. The persistently warm temperatures for the months of June through August, combined with below-average precipitation, also contributed to a record-breaking drought across the southern part of the United States. Texas was subjected to its driest summer ever, with a statewide average of only 2.44 inches of rain -- 5.29 inches below the long-term average, and more than an inch less than the previous driest summer in 1956. Neighboring Southwestern states New Mexico and Oklahoma were also drought-stricken, experiencing their second- and third-driest summers respectively. Conversely, New Jersey and California had their wettest summers ever. Meteorologists are predicting no immediate end in sight to the heat or drought afflicting the Southern states. NOAA announced Thursday that la nina, a naturally occurring climate phenomenon located over the tropical Pacific Ocean, is expected to strengthen and affect global weather patterns. Scientists attribute the extreme weather around the globe during the first half of 2011 to the weather event, and predict that the drought currently overtaking the states of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma is likely to persist. The extremely dry plains are a tinderbox for Texas; nearly 180 wildfires have been reported across the state in the past seven days, the Texas Forest Service Texas said. A large wildfire blazing outside Austin has destroyed nearly 1,400 homes and is not near containment. Write highlights for this article.","response":"1.

Step 1: Establish variables Let the larger number be L and the smaller number be S. Step 2: Analyze the given information We are given that the difference between the two numbers (L - S) is 1390. We are also given that when the larger number L is divided by the smaller number S, the quotient is 6 and the remainder is 15. Step 3: Set up equations From the given information, we can set up the following two equations: 1) L - S = 1390 2) L = 6S + 15 Step 4: Solve the equations We can solve for one variable and substitute it into the other equation. Solving for L from equation (1): L = S + 1390 Substitute this expression for L in equation (2): S + 1390 = 6S + 15 Now, let's solve for S: 1390 - 15 = 6S - S 1375 = 5S S = 275 Now that we have found the value of S, we can find L by substituting it back into the equation: L = S + 1390 L = 275 + 1390 L = 1665 Hence, the larger number is 1665.

The shorter man takes the initiative to start rounds, grabbing the ball and putting it back on the table.

Step-by-step justification: - Abandoning a pet at the shelter implies that the pet is left in a place where it can be taken care of and eventually adopted by someone else. - Finding a new family suggests that the pet will become a part of this new group of people. - Going through the options: 1. Acquire: This implies that the pet would \\"get\\" the family, but it is actually the other way around - the family acquires/adopts the pet. 2. Join: This is the correct option as it means the pet will become a member of the new family. 3. Maintain: This implies that the pet is already a part of the family and will continue to stay with them, which is not the case since it was abandoned. 4.

Who was the commander of the Russian forces in this battle ?","response":"The Battle of Stalingrad, considered one of the major turning points in the Second World War, was a hard-fought contest between the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. This brutal and devastating battle took place between August 23, 1942, and February 2, 1943, and had a significant impact on the course of the war, as the Soviet Red Army successfully halted the German advance into Eastern Europe and initiated a series of critical counteroffensives. The commander of the Russian (Soviet) Forces during the Battle of Stalingrad was Marshal Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov. Born on December 1, 1896, in Strelkovka, Russia, Zhukov quickly established a reputation as a skilled and determined military leader. Starting with the rank of conscript in the Russian Imperial Army during World War I, he rose through the ranks to become a significant figure in the Soviet Union's military operations. Though Marshal Georgy Zhukov is widely recognized as the leading Soviet commander throughout the Second World War, it is vital to mention other prominent figures who played a crucial role in the Battle of Stalingrad. Aside from Zhukov, the Soviet forces were under the direct operational command of Marshal Andrey Ivanovich Yeryomenko and General Vasily Ivanovich Chuikov. Marshal Andrey Yeryomenko was appointed as the commander of the Southeastern Front by Joseph Stalin. Later, the Stalingrad Front was created, and Yeryomenko was instructed to focus on the protection of Stalingrad. He coordinated the initial strategic defensive operations in the city. Upon the merging of the Southeastern and Stalingrad Fronts into the newly formed Don Front in September 1942, Yeryomenko continued to oversee the Soviet forces directly engaged in repelling the German offensive. General Vasily Chuikov was in charge of the 62nd Army, which bore the brunt of the fighting within Stalingrad itself. The 62nd Army was responsible for defending the city against waves of assaults launched by the German Sixth Army, led by General Friedrich Paulus. Chuikov’s leadership and tactical acumen significantly contributed to the Soviet army's resilience and eventual triumph in the battle. In summary, Marshal Georgy Zhukov was the primary Russian commander during the Battle of Stalingrad, assisted by subordinates Marshal Andrey Yeryomenko and General Vasily Chuikov. Their combined efforts and leadership played a decisive role in thwarting the Nazi advance into the Soviet Union, marking Stalingrad as one of the pivotal moments of the Second World War."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A man wearing a black water-proof garment is making his way through crops that have recently been watered.\\" is it true that \\"Pulling a box.\\"?

(July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Phineas and Ferb are celebrating the fifth anniversary of when they got their pet platypus, Perry. In commemoration, they create a giant shuttlecock and robotic replica figure of Perry to play an improvised game of badminton. However, when Perry's hovercraft accidentally collides with their shuttlecock, the boys crash into Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's laboratory and destroy his \\"Other-Dimension-Inator\\", which is designed to help him travel to parallel dimensions. Intrigued by the idea, the two help Doofenshmirtz rebuild the machine, while Perry arrives on his mission to stop Doofenshmirtz. Unwilling to give away his secret identity to the boys (which would get him relocated to another family), Perry reverts to his pet mode and is forced to watch them help Doofenshmirtz activate his invention. The group is transported to an alternate dimension where a second, truly intelligent and evil Doofenshmirtz rules over his Tri-State Area. The second Perry (known as Platyborg), was converted into an evil cyborg by Doofenshimrtz-2 and programmed to serve as his second-in-command and general of his army of Norm-Bots. When the boys arrive with Perry to Doofenshmirtz-2's office, Doof-2 recognizes Perry as a secret agent and orders Platyborg to attack Perry. When that doesn't affect him, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders Platyborg to attack the boys next, which forces Perry to reveal his secret identity to stop Platyborg from doing so, much to the others' shock. Doofenshmirtz-2 then sends several of his Norm Bots to catch Perry and the boys, but the trio escapes. Afterwards, Phineas expresses his anger at Perry for using him and Ferb as a cover for his double life. After seeing that their remote for the portal is broken, the boys find their alternate selves, who are shown to have grown up without knowing about summer....

Doofenshmirtz-2 has been able to successfully establish his control over the Tri-State Area with the help of his second-in-command, Platyborg, a cyborg version of Perry the Platypus. Platyborg was forcibly converted into an evil cyborg by Doofenshmirtz-2 and programmed to serve him and lead his army of Norm-Bots, which he uses to maintain control and enforce his rule over the Tri-State Area.

The answer is:","response":"Mitt Romney first ran for President of the United States in the 2008 election cycle. He announced his candidacy on February 13, 2007, during a speech at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Mitt Romney, full name Willard Mitt Romney, was born on March 12, 1947, in Detroit, Michigan. He was the son of George W. Romney, a three-term governor of Michigan and the CEO of American Motors. Mitt Romney's political career began in 1994 when he ran for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts but was defeated by the incumbent, Edward M. Kennedy. In 2002, Romney successfully ran for governor of Massachusetts, holding the office from January 2, 2003, until January 4, 2007. During the 2008 Republican primaries, Mitt Romney's opponents included John McCain, Mike Huckabee, Ron Paul, Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson, and others. Romney campaigned on various issues, such as the economy, national security, and social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. He presented himself as the conservative alternative to the more moderate John McCain. Throughout the primary season, Romney won several primaries and caucuses, including Michigan, Nevada, Massachusetts, Wyoming, and Utah, accumulating a total of 271 delegates. However, after spending over 40 million of his own money on the campaign and failing to gain enough traction in the primaries, he ultimately suspended his campaign on February 7, 2008. The Republican nomination was eventually secured by John McCain, who consequently lost the general election to Barack Obama. Mitt Romney ran for president again in the 2012 election cycle, securing the Republican nomination this time around. He chose Paul Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, as his running mate, and they faced off against the incumbent, President Barack Obama, and Vice President Joe Biden. Romney's campaign emphasized economic recovery and job creation, as well as the repeal of Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. However, Romney was ultimately defeated by Obama, who secured a second term in the White House. In conclusion, Mitt Romney first ran for President of the United States in the 2008 election cycle, announcing his candidacy in February 2007 but ultimately suspending his campaign a year later. While he did not win the nomination that year, he went on to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 but was defeated by Barack Obama in the general election."},{"question":"In the Thress model, at the discount level of 8a and the net gain of 32 million, the basic market incurs a welfare loss of 480 million (0.

From this, it can be inferred that the question is referring to Discovery Channel, a popular television network known for nature and animal-related content. Step 2: Review the choices The question gives a list of five choices: open ocean, Gulf of Mexico, tornado, television program, and coral reef. To answer the question, we need to find what Discovery has a number of, featuring a shark. Step 3: Evaluate the relevance of each choice - Open ocean and Gulf of Mexico: These are geographical locations, and while they may have sharks, the question is about what \\"Discovery\\" has a number of, making these choices less relevant. - Tornado: This choice seems unrelated to the question since it's a weather phenomenon and does not directly relate to sharks or Discovery Channel. - Television program: This choice is a category of content associated with a television network like Discovery Channel. Considering their focus on nature and animals, this choice is relevant to the question. - Coral reef: Similar to open ocean and Gulf of Mexico, this is a specific type of aquatic habitat. Though it might contain sharks, it's not an answer that would directly describe what Discovery has a number of. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the analysis of the choices, \\"television program\\" is the most appropriate answer. Discovery Channel has a number of television programs featuring sharks, such as the annual event \\"Shark Week,\\" which showcases various programs about sharks."},{"question":"News article: Hire Us PPP offers the highest quality polling at the most affordable price of any company out there.

Webster Thursday, April 7, 2011 12:49 EDT A new poll out of Mississippi finds that in a bastion of America’s south, many Republican voters have tightly held onto the old, hateful views of race as a dividing line in society. A full 46 percent of Mississippi Republicans said they believe interracial marriage should be illegal, according to the left-leaning survey group Public Policy Polling. Only 40 percent said they thought it should remain legal, with the rest unsure. Republicans who said they were in favor of banning interracial marriages were most frequently supporters of Fox News contributor Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor (R) who quit half-way through her first term. Their least liked candidate was Mitt Romney, the former radio executive and Governor of Massachusetts (R). Romney, Palin and Fox News employee Mike Huckabee are widely considered to be the top three most likely Republican front-runners. None of them have officially announced their candidacy. The poll found that overall, Mississippi Republicans want Gov. Haley Barbour as their nominee over other potential candidates. Barbour won 37 percent of the survey’s respondents, compared to 19 percent for Huckabee and 10 percent for former Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich, the one-time Republican Speaker of the House. Barbour’s popularity may have something to do with the mentality of his constituency in Mississippi. For instance, in a state where almost half of the Republicans believe interracial marriage should be illegal, Barbour has praised a civil rights-era group that fought against segregation and refused to denounce an effort to get a state license plate to honor a former leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan terrorist group. Barbour was most recently in the headlines after it was revealed that he spent over 300,000 on out-of-state travel in 2010, campaigning with fellow Republicans and meeting with wealthy benefactors.

Please remove spaces between words.","response":"Transporting sports equipment can be a challenging task as it often involves careful packing and handling to ensure that the items reach the destination safely and in proper working condition. The process starts from packing the equipment correctly, choosing the right method of transportation, and ends at unpacking it carefully at the destination. Let's delve deeper into this: 1. Packing your Sports Equipment: Before you even consider transportation, the first step is to pack your equipment properly: - Use Quality Packaging Materials: To ensure the safety of your sports equipment, invest in high-quality packing materials such as bubble-wrap, sturdy boxes, packing tapes, etc. These materials will provide the necessary cushioning and prevent any damage during transit. - Be Organized: Keep your equipment organized to make the packing process easier. If possible, disassemble large items to save space and make them easier to transport. Also, keep little items in separate bags to prevent them from getting lost. - Securely Pack: Securely wrapping each item will help to minimize movement during transport and thus decrease the chances of damage. Make sure there's no space left in the boxes for the items to shift around. 2. Mode of Transportation: After properly packing your sports equipment, the next step is to choose the mode of transportation: - Personal Vehicle: If you have a large vehicle, you might be able to transport your sports equipment on your own. This option provides you the flexibility to pack and transport the items at your own pace and convenience. - Hire a Professional Mover: If you have a large amount of sports equipment or if the items are bulky or delicate, hiring professional movers may be a good option. They have the necessary expertise and resources to safely transport these items. - Shipping: In case you are travelling by air or need to send your sports equipment overseas, consider shipping them. You can choose from various courier companies who offer door-to-door delivery. Keep in mind the restrictions and guidelines of the specific courier company. 3. Unpacking your Sports Equipment: - Do It Carefully: Always unpack your sports equipment as carefully as you packed it. Check all the items one by one to ensure that there is no damage. - Assemble Carefully: If you had disassembled any equipment before packing, take your time to reassemble it carefully to ensure its proper functioning. 4. Other Tips: - Insurance: Consider insuring expensive sports equipment. This can help to cover costs in case of damage or loss during transportation. - Correct Documentation: Make sure to complete all necessary documentation such as customs forms if you are shipping the equipment internationally. Ensure that the weight, size and fragility of your sports equipment are considered while organising transportation. It's always best to plan ahead to make sure that everything goes smoothly and your sports equipment reaches its destination safely."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Context: Jesse boarded the bus and was harassed by someone on the bus.

Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. This event was a tragedy that pushed the country into mourning and left a significant impact on the nation. To provide a detailed context of the event, JFK was on a political trip in Texas in an attempt to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party. The trip was first announced to the public in September 1963 with the full itinerary released a day prior to the fateful day. The stop included five destinations: San Antonio, Houston, Fort Worth, Dallas, and Austin. On the day of his assassination, Kennedy began in Fort Worth. He made a public speech before heading to Dallas where he had another speech and luncheon planned at the Dallas Trade Mart. Kennedy was traveling in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas when he was fatally shot. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder of a local policeman, and later he was charged with Kennedy's assassination as well. He denied the charges, claiming that he was a \\"patsy\\". However, before he could be brought to trial, Oswald was shot dead by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner, amidst live-telecast of Oswald's transfer from the city jail to the county jail. Kennedy's assassination led to many conspiracy theories, some of which persist till this day. The Warren Commission, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded in their report delivered in September 1964 that Kennedy was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, essentially acting alone. This conclusion has since been both supported and contradicted by various other investigative bodies and individual researchers. In Dallas, the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building, from where Oswald allegedly shot Kennedy, has been transformed into a museum dedicated to JFK’s life and legacy, known as the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. The Dealey Plaza, itself, has been designated as a National Historic Landmark District to commemorate the event. Every year, people visit these sites to pay their respect to the beloved president and to remember the dark day that changed the course of American history."},{"question":"Sentence from a movie review: believe that resident evil is not it . Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","response":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it seems that the reviewer perceives the movie \\"Resident Evil\\" negatively. The phrase \\"believe that Resident Evil is not it\\" implies that the reviewer does not consider the film as a good or satisfactory example of what they might have been looking for in a movie. Although the provided sentence is quite brief, it carries a sense of disappointment or disapproval concerning the film. It is essential to consider that movie reviews can vary significantly, depending on the individual's perspective, taste, and criteria for assessment. A single sentence from a movie review may not do justice to the reviewer's full opinion. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's perception of the movie, one should seek out the rest of the review or look for other reviews as well. Nonetheless, in this specific case, the sentence implies a negative standpoint on the \\"Resident Evil\\" movie. However, without additional context or the complete review, one cannot determine the specific aspects the reviewer might have found unsatisfactory or underwhelming. These could range from the plot, acting performances, visual effects, pacing, direction, or any other myriad of factors that contribute to a movie's overall evaluation."},{"question":"Process: - Magma moves closer to the Earth&#x27;s crust - The magma starts to cool - The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense - The condensed magma solidifies - The solidified magma forms minerals. suppose environment improving makes butterflies more healthy happens, how will it affect the magma condenses less.

For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. Now, I have a new situation: David is interested in how electricity works.

Context: Jaime Federico Said Camil Saldaña da Gama (born 22 July 1973), known professionally as Jaime Camil, is a Mexican actor, singer and host. He is best known for his roles as Fernando Mendiola in \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" and Rogelio de la Vega in \\"Jane the Virgin.\\" Hypothesis: Fernando Mendiola is the most famous latino character.","response":"Drawing the hypothesis that \\"Fernando Mendiola is the most famous latino character\\" from the given context would not be appropriate, as there is not enough information provided to determine the character's overall fame within the Latino community or in comparison to other Latino characters. To examine the validity of this hypothesis, we need to explore several factors, such as the popularity of the character, the cultural impact of the character, and the role this character plays within the entertainment industry. 1. Popularity of the character: The context mentions that Jaime Camil is \\"best known\\" for his roles as Fernando Mendiola in \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" and Rogelio de la Vega in \\"Jane the Virgin.\\" This suggests that these are two very significant roles in Camil's career, but it does not necessarily confirm that Fernando Mendiola is the most famous Latino character. We would need to gather more data on consumption metrics, such as television ratings, streaming numbers, and overall viewership, to compare the popularity of Fernando Mendiola with other well-known Latino characters. 2. Cultural impact of the character: To determine the impact of Fernando Mendiola on Latino culture, we would need to investigate the character's influence on viewers and how the character has been received by critics and fans alike. Public opinion, critical acclaim, or recognition through awards could provide insights into how Fernando Mendiola has impacted and resonated with audiences. Evaluating interviews, articles, and fan responses would also contribute to understanding the character's cultural impact and help us compare it to other Latino characters. 3. Role within the entertainment industry: Comparing Fernando Mendiola's presence within the entertainment industry to other Latino characters is essential in understanding the character's overall fame. This analysis entails examining the longevity and prominence of the character in the television industry, the relevance of the show \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" in relation to other popular Latino shows, and the international success of the character, like in different countries and markets. We would need to gather data on the presence and achievements of various Latino characters in the entertainment industry and compare them to Fernando Mendiola's role to support or refute the hypothesis properly. In conclusion, while Jaime Camil's portrayal of Fernando Mendiola in \\"La Fea Mas Bella\\" is one of his best-known roles, there is not enough information in the given context to support the hypothesis that Fernando Mendiola is the most famous Latino character. Further investigation and data collection would be required to analyze the character's popularity, cultural impact, and presence within the entertainment industry in comparison to other Latino characters."},{"question":"Sentence 1: The Wilhelm Archipelago is an island group off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula in Antarctica .

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Tom Costello and Alastair Jamieson An object that could be debris from a Boeing 777 has been found off Mozambique and is being examined by investigators searching for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, sources told NBC News. Early photographic analysis of the object suggests it could have come from the doomed jet, which vanished almost exactly two years ago. It was found on a sandbank in the Mozambique Channel — the body of water between Mozambique in eastern Africa and Madagascar — and in the same corner of the southern Indian Ocean where the only confirmed piece of debris, a flaperon, was found last July. Investigators in Malaysia, Australia and the United States have seen photographs of the latest object, and sources say there is a good chance it comes from a Boeing 777. Possible debris from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found off Mozambique on a sandbank in the Mozambique Channel — the body of water between Mozambique in eastern Africa and Madagascar. NBC News The object has the words \\"NO STEP\\" on it and could be from the plane's horizontal stabilizer — the wing-like parts attached to the tail, sources say. It was discovered by an American who has been blogging about the search for MH370.

Possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been found off Mozambique, and early photographic analysis suggests it could have come from the doomed jet, which vanished almost exactly two years ago. NBC News Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said on Twitter that there was a \\"high possibility debris found in Mozambique belongs to\\" a Boeing 777, but he said that was \\"yet to be confirmed and verified.\\" Darren Chester, Australia's minister for infrastructure and transport, said in a statement Thursday that the location was consistent with drift modeling related to the search. The discovery \\"reaffirms the search area for MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,\\" he said. Boeing engineers are looking at the photos, according to sources. The company has declined to comment. The development comes days ahead of the second anniversary of the jet's disappearance en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Possible Boeing 777 parts found that could be from MH370. No trace has been found of Flight MH370 except for the single barnacle-encrusted flaperon that washed up on the eastern shore of Reunion, east of Madagascar, last July. French aviation experts verified it as part of aircraft 9M-MRO after more than a month of forensic analysis at a laboratory near Toulouse. There have been false hopes over the course of the investigation: In January, aviation officials ruled that two objects recovered from Malaysia's east coast were not from the missing airliner.

However, the sonar search operation has turned up a 19th-century shipwreck. Almost three-quarters of an internationally set 46,000-square-mile search zone has been covered so far in the hunt for the missing airliner — an area of ocean floor larger than the state of South Carolina.

They're hard working, respectful but strange sometimes. If you don't understand the culture, you will get some problems with them. Asian people are different from any other cultures if you think you know them, you might want to think again. How are they different? When it comes to most Asian culture, respect is everything. You can do anything you want but don't disrespect an Asian man. You will get some real consequences afterward and especially if he is your boss. It's something called \\" _ \\" in the Asian culture. It's ridiculous sometimes but it's their culture. Sometimes their culture can come in between their relationship at work. Asian people might expect a lot of respect from their co-workers when their co-workers just see them as an equal. Americans are very different from Asian people. If you're Asian, you might want to understand the American culture and even adapt to their culture if you work with them. It will be easier for you since you're in their countries. Imagine an American working in China, expecting Chinese co-workers to get along with him when he criticizes them straight out on every single matter in front of everyone. I think they will take him outside and take care of him. It just doesn't work that way with Asian people. If you're an American boss giving your Asian employee a review, you will see that they will have a problem with your negative remarks. They will think that you don't like them, disrespectful, and want to get rid of them; when in fact, you're just doing your job. Of course, it's not fair for you as an American boss but just expect that it can be something that is on your Asian employee's mind.

Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote \\"guilty\\" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury.

It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous. - Manacus is a genus of passerine birds in the manakin family which are found in the forests of tropical mainland Central and South America , and on Trinidad and Tobago . There are four species . White - collared manakin , Manacus candei Orange - collared manakin , Manacus aurantiacus Golden - collared manakin , Manacus vitellinus White - bearded manakin , Manacus manacus The \`\` Almirante manakin '' ( Manacus x cerritus ) are stereotyped hybrids between the white - collared and the golden - collared species , found in Bocas del Toro Province , Panama ( Brumfield et al. , 2001 ; McDonald et al. , 2001 ) . These are small , compact , short - tailed birds with a heavy hooked bill and orange legs . The males have brightly coloured plumage and long puffed throat feathers , whereas the females are the typical manakin dull olive hue . The females lay two eggs in a shallow cup nest in a tree . Nest - building , incubation for 18 -- 21 days , and care of the young are undertaken by the female alone , since manakins do not form stable pairs . Manacus manakins feed low in the trees on fruit and some insects , both plucked from the foliage in flight . Like some other manakin species , this genus has spectacular courtship rituals , in which the males give communal displays in a specially prepared lek . The males jump with their throat feathers erected to form a beard , and give whistles together with the characteristic loud snaps ( like a breaking twig ) and various buzzing , rustling and whiffling noises made with the wings . The males of three very closely related species , the white - collared manakin of the Caribbean slopes of Central America , and its Pacific counterparts , the orange - collared and golden - collared manakins , have heavily modified wings with the five outer primaries very narrow for their outer half , and the inner primaries thickened and bowed . - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Brood parasites are organisms that rely on others to raise their young. The strategy appears among birds, insects and some fish. The brood parasite manipulates a host, either of the same or of another species, to raise its young as if it were its own. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The cuckoos are a family of birds, Cuculidae, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes. The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae respectively. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The cuckoo-finch (\\"Anomalospiza imberbis\\"), also known as the parasitic weaver or cuckoo weaver, is a small passerine bird now placed in the family Viduidae with the indigobirds and whydahs. It occurs in grassland in Africa south of the Sahara. The male is mainly yellow and green while the female is buff with dark streaks. The eggs are laid in the nests of other birds. - Tobago is an autonomous island within the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is located northeast of the mainland of Trinidad and southeast of Grenada. The island lies outside the hurricane belt. According to the earliest English-language source cited in the \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\", Tobago bore a name that has become the English word \\"tobacco.\\" The national bird of Tobago is the cocrico. - Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus \\"Nicotiana\\" and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is \\"N. tabacum\\". The more potent variant \\"N. rustica\\" is also used around the world. - Shrikes are carnivorous passerine birds of the family Laniidae. The family is composed of thirty-one species in four genera. They are fairly closely related to the bush-shrike family Malaconotidae. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Cowbirds are birds belonging to the genus Molothrus in the family Icteridae. They are brood parasitic New World birds which are unrelated to the Old World cuckoos, one of which, the common cuckoo, is the most famous brood parasitic bird. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - Passer is a genus of sparrows, also known as the true sparrows. The genus includes the house sparrow and the Eurasian tree sparrow, some of the most common birds in the world. They are small birds with thick bills for eating seeds, and are mostly coloured grey or brown. Native to the Old World, some species have been introduced throughout the world. - The manakins are a clade (Pipridae) of small suboscine passerine birds. The group contains some 60 species distributed through the American tropics. The name is from Middle Dutch \\"mannekijn\\" \\"little man\\" (also the source of the different bird name \\"mannikin\\"). - Trinidad (Spanish: \\"Trinity\\") is the larger and more populous of the two major islands and numerous landforms which make up the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. The island lies off the northeastern coast of Venezuela and sits on the continental shelf of South America. Though geographically part of the South American continent, from a socio-economic standpoint it is often referred to as the southernmost island in the Caribbean. With an area of , it is also the sixth largest in the West Indies. - A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \\"oscen\\", \\"a songbird\\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The order Squamata, or the scaled reptiles, are the largest recent order of reptiles, comprising all lizards and snakes. With over 10,000 species, it is also the second-largest order of extant vertebrates, after the perciform fish, and roughly equal in number to the Saurischia (one of the 2 major groups of dinosaurs). Members of the order are distinguished by their skins, which bear horny scales or shields. They also possess movable quadrate bones, making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the neurocranium. This is particularly visible in snakes, which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey. They are the most variably sized order of reptiles, ranging from the dwarf gecko (\\"Sphaerodactylus ariasae\\") to the green anaconda (\\"Eunectes murinus\\") and the now-extinct mosasaurs, which reached lengths of . What is the relationship between 'manacus' and 'pipridae'? Answer:","response":"Manacus is a genus of passerine birds that belongs to the family Pipridae. Passerine birds are known for their distinctive toe arrangement that facilitates perching, and they represent more than half of all bird species. Pipridae is a family of small suboscine passerine birds, commonly known as manakins. Manakins are primarily found in the forests of tropical mainland Central and South America, as well as Trinidad and Tobago. These birds have unique physical characteristics and exhibit spectacular courtship rituals. The relationship between Manacus and Pipridae is that Manacus is a genus within the Pipridae family. This means that Manacus is a group of species that share common traits and are closely related to each other, being classified under the larger family Pipridae. The Pipridae family, in turn, includes other genera of manakins, making Manacus a part of the diverse family of manakin birds. Overall, Manacus and Pipridae are connected through their taxonomic classification, where Manacus represents a specific genus of manakin birds within the broader family of Pipridae."},{"question":"Question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\". - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903. - The Union Association was a league in Major League Baseball which lasted for only one season in 1884 . St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season . Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August , and four teams folded during the season and were replaced . Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league , this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians , most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract . The league had a number of major league players ( on the St. Louis franchise , at least ) , but the league 's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues . James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league either . The earliest record he could find of the Union Association as a major league was Ernest Lanigan 's The Baseball Cyclopedia , published in 1922 . For example , the league 's only \`\` star '' player , Fred Dunlap , led the league in batting average with .412 ( 86 points higher than his second - best season and 120 points higher than his career average ) , on - base percentage , slugging percentage , runs scored , hits , total bases , and home runs ( with just 13 , typical for the era ) . After the league folded , Dunlap never hit more than .274 or more than 10 home runs until he retired in 1891 , another measure of the inferior quality of the Union Association . Of the 272 players in the Association , 107 ( 39.34 % ) never played in another major league , while 72 ( 26.47 % ) played very briefly ( less than 300 at bats and / or 50 hits ) in other major leagues , and 79 ( 29.04 % ) had longer careers but little success in other major leagues . A relatively modern comparison could be the World Football League of the early 1970s contrasted with the National Football League .

În loc să folosească clonarea animală ca o soluție la problemele legate de hrana în Europa, sursa sugerează că un accent pe calitatea alimentelor și practicile agricole existente ar putea fi suficiente. Agricultura europeană este recunoscută pentru producerea unor alimente de înaltă calitate, atât prin metodele tradiționale de producție agricolă, cât și prin cele bazate pe practici organice și durabile. Agricultura tradițională se referă la metodele de cultivare a plantelor și creșterea animalelor în conformitate cu tradițiile și obiceiurile moștenite din generații anterioare. Această abordare poate include fertilizarea chimică și utilizarea pesticidelor. În contrast, agricultura organică se bazează pe principiile echilibrului natural și a durabilității, evitând utilizarea substanțelor chimice de sinteză și a tehnicilor de inginerie genetică în favoarea celor naturale, cum ar fi compostul și rotația culturilor.

K. Paasikivi, and the Senate asked the German troops to remain in Finland. 3 March 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and 7 March German-Finnish agreements bound White Finland to the German Empire's sphere of influence. General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks and capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed these plans due to their peace treaties with Lenin. The Civil War weakened the Finnish Parliament; it became a Rump Parliament that included only three socialist representatives. On 9 October 1918, under pressure from Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, the brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, to become the King of Finland. The German leadership was able to utilise the breakdown of Russia for the geopolitical benefit of the German Empire in Fennoscandia also. The Civil War and the aftermath diminished independence of Finland, compared to the status it had held at the turn of the year 1917-1918. The economic condition of Finland deteriorated drastically from 1918; recovery to pre-conflict levels was achieved only in 1925. The most acute crisis was in food supply, already deficient in 1917, though large-scale starvation had been avoided that year. The Civil War caused marked starvation in southern Finland. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium. Hoover arranged for the delivery of food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, and to allow food into the country.

Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Which group's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force? Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.","response":"Group George's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force since they vented the cans before heating them. Venting the cans allowed the pressure to escape and prevented the buildup of pressure inside the can. This resulted in a lower force of air molecules against the container walls compared to Group Jones' cans, which exploded due to the increased pressure caused by heating the unvented cans."},{"question":"The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of Alexander Pushkin (Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called \\"высо́кий стиль\\" — \\"high style\\") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов), Nikolai Gogol (Никола́й Го́голь), Aleksander Griboyedov (Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech. What happened to some expressions in Pushkin's writing?","response":"Some expressions from Pushkin's writing, as well as those of other Russian writers from the early 19th century such as Nikolai Gogol, Aleksander Griboyedov and Mikhail Lermontov, became proverbs or sayings. These expressions have been integrated into modern Russian colloquial speech and can still be frequently found today. Despite the passage of time and changes in the language, these remnants of Pushkin's transformative approach to Russian literature have endured. The reason is likely because he favored the use of grammar and vocabulary from the spoken language of the time, which likely facilitated their adoption into everyday language and their continued relevance. As a result, expressions that originated in the literary works of these writers have remained part of the living language, rather than becoming archaic or obsolete."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"As family bed boosters have noted, male physicians, who have no idea what motherhood is like, have cowed women for decades into doing unnatural and destructive things.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Women had no choice but to rely on male physicians.\\" is true (see options)? Options: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","response":"B). It is not possible to tell. The given premise essentially states that male physicians, without truly understanding the experience of motherhood, have pushed women into doing things that may be considered unnatural and even harmful. It implies that the advice of male physicians at times might not have been in the best interest of the mother and the child. However, we still cannot conclude with certainty that women had no choice but to rely on male physicians. The premise makes a specific claim about male physicians' understanding of motherhood, but it does not directly address women's options when it comes to seeking medical advice. While the premise might hint at the fact that male physicians have dominated the medical field, it does not provide enough evidence to claim that women had no choice but to rely solely on male physicians. Before making the conclusion, we would need to consider the following factors: 1. Availability of female physicians: Were female physicians available throughout history to provide medical guidance? If female physicians were available, women may have had the choice to seek advice from them instead of solely relying on male physicians. 2. Cultural and societal factors: Were there social or cultural norms at different points in history that limited women's options in seeking medical advice? These norms could have led women to rely on male physicians even if they would have preferred to consult with female physicians. 3. Alternative sources of knowledge: Apart from physicians, women might have sought advice from experienced family members, friends, or even traditional healers. While these alternative sources might not provide professional medical advice, they could help women make informed decisions about their well-being and that of their children. In conclusion, based on the given premise, we cannot definitively say whether women had no choice but to rely on male physicians. We would need more information on the availability of female physicians, cultural and societal factors, and alternative sources of knowledge to make a well-rounded conclusion. Thus, the best answer is that it is not possible to tell."},{"question":"– Teenagers who think high school interferes with valuable sleeping time might be surprised to find out that government experts agree with them.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"The two questions you have asked are closely related but not exactly the same. The first question is seeking guidance on how to bypass the iCloud lock for a specific iOS version (iOS 9), while the second question is inquiring about the possibility of breaking the iCloud lock, in general. Let me provide you with a detailed answer about bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock and whether it can be broken. Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock: iCloud Activation Lock is a built-in security feature in iOS devices, designed by Apple to discourage theft and protect user data. When an iOS device is locked with an iCloud account, it is nearly impossible to bypass that lock without the account owner's permission. Most methods you may find online are either scams or likely to make your device unusable. Furthermore, attempting to bypass iCloud Activation Lock is frowned upon and could be considered illegal in certain jurisdictions, depending on the context and ownership of the device. That being said, if you genuinely need to unlock an iCloud locked device, your best option is to reach out to the original device owner to obtain the Apple ID and password or ask them to remove the device from their iCloud account. If that is not possible, you may consider getting in touch with Apple Support and provide them with proof of purchase to demonstrate that the device was purchased legally. If you meet the necessary criteria, Apple will assist you in removing the iCloud lock. Breaking the iCloud Lock: As mentioned earlier, breaking the iCloud lock is highly challenging due to the robust security mechanisms implemented by Apple. Most solutions advertised online are scams and can further damage your device. Even if one manages to bypass the lock, there is no guarantee that the device would function correctly. Additionally, attempting to break the iCloud lock may have legal implications. In conclusion, bypassing or breaking iCloud lock is not recommended, and you should instead attempt to contact the original owner or seek assistance from Apple with the appropriate documentation to resolve the issue legitimately. Keep in mind that using potentially illegal methods or scam services can lead to worsening your situation or even legal troubles."},{"question":"Q:Given this review: \\"LIN Lin\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Article: In the 19th century, there used to be a model of how to be a good person. There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins. These days that model is out of fashion. You usually can't change your behavior by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too. The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control. Much of our behavior, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits--cue, routine, reward. You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be a cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk. Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neuralnetworks inside. To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues. This is a bit...

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","response":"The first step in the process of mushroom development, as outlined in the given sequence, is the release of spores from the basidia. This is a critical initial event in the life cycle of a mushroom, as it sets the stage for the germination, growth, and eventual formation of new mushrooms. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of this process, let's break it down step by step: 1. The basidia gives off spores: Basidia are the specialized reproductive cells of basidiomycetes, a group of fungi that includes mushrooms. These cells are found in the fertile layer of the mushroom cap, known as the hymenium, where they produce and release spores into the environment. This is the first step in the reproductive process of the mushroom. 2. The spores germinate: Once the spores are released from the basidia, they are dispersed by various means, such as wind and water, or by interactions with animals. When the spores land on a suitable substrate, they begin to germinate, giving rise to the next generation of fungi. 3. The spores create hyphae: As the spores germinate, they begin to grow thin, filamentous structures called hyphae. Hyphae are the primary growth structures of fungi and serve to absorb nutrients, anchor the fungus to the substrate, and provide an extensive network for nutrient and resource distribution within the organism. 4. Multiple hyphae meet and converge: Over time, the hyphae produced by germinating spores will grow and expand, eventually encountering and fusing with hyphae from other compatible fungal spores. This convergence of hyphae allows the fungi to form a larger, interconnected network. 5. They join with mycelium: As the hyphae continue to grow and converge, they form an extensive, web-like structure called mycelium. The mycelium is vital to the fungus, as it serves as the primary means for nutrient absorption and resource distribution throughout the organism. 6. A hyphal knot forms in the ground: Under the right environmental conditions, the mycelium may begin to produce specialized, tightly packed structures called hyphal knots. These knots are the precursors to the fruiting bodies of the mushroom—also known as the mushroom cap—or other structures used for reproduction in other fungi. 7. A primordia shoots out of the ground: As the hyphal knot continues to develop, it will begin to differentiate into a mushroom primordium. This primordium is the initial structure that will eventually grow and mature into a fully-formed mushroom. 8. A mushroom cap is formed: Over time, the primordium will continue to grow and develop, eventually forming the familiar mushroom cap structure. This cap will contain the reproductive structures (basidia) that will release spores, beginning the entire process anew. In summary, the first step of the process in mushroom development is the basidia giving off spores. This is the starting point from which the entire life cycle of the mushroom begins, eventually leading to the formation of a new mushroom cap and the potential release of even more spores, ensuring the continuation of the fungal population."},{"question":"Options: 1). negative. 2). positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze .","response":"2). positive.

The word \\"im\\" works for this context since the definite article for \\"Hotel\\" in German is \\"das,\\" and when \\"in\\" is combined with \\"das,\\" it becomes \\"im.\\" 5. \\"Hawthorne Dene Hotel\\" - Names of hotels or establishments usually remain unchanged in translations, so you would keep it as \\"Hawthorne Dene Hotel.\\" By combining these parts you get the sentence \\"Wann möchten Sie im Hawthorne Dene Hotel übernachten?\\" which translates to \\"When would you like to stay at the Hawthorne Dene Hotel?\\" in English."},{"question":"Process: - A star burns in space - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. suppose the star has less mass happens, how will it affect the red giant is smaller. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"If a star has less mass, it will indeed affect its transformation and can lead it to become a smaller red giant. This factor directly impacts a step of the process. In the early life of a star, it burns hydrogen in its core, which forms helium. After the hydrogen fuel in the core is exhausted, the star evolves into a red giant. The size of a red giant depends on the initial mass of the star. If the initial stellar mass is lower, the resulting red giant will be smaller. During the red giant phase, the star burns helium into heavier elements, and the core contracts under gravity and heats up. If the star doesn't have enough mass to generate the extreme temperatures and pressures needed to burn carbon (approximately 1 billion K and pressures hundred times that of the Earth's core), it will not be able to proceed through the next phase of stellar evolution. Consequently, it will shed its outer layers and leave behind a core, forming a smaller white dwarf. To summarize, a star with less mass will directly impact the process by resulting in a smaller red giant. This will further influence subsequent steps of the process, making the evolution path of smaller stars different from larger ones. In the end, lower mass stars do not go through core-collapse, and instead form white dwarfs directly."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Joe lived in East Antarctica while his buddy Jim lived in West Antarctica. They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife. They would often complain about the weather. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend experienced more weather fronts?

According to a new survey, four in ten adults regularly check their partner's device behind their back to keep an eye on them - with women most likely to snoop. The fairer sex is also the most suspicious with 44 per cent of women admitting to checking their other halves' phones compared to 36 per cent of men. Six in 10 snoops have caught their partner cheating on them or talking to someone they shouldn't be. Researchers also found 34 per cent know their partner's mobile PIN, 39 per cent know their email account password and 26 per cent know their Facebook password. Some 31 per cent don't know their significant other's PINS or passwords and are happy with that but more than half (54 per cent) would be suspicious if this wasn't the case for them. In fact, just over half believe sharing your mobile PIN or social media passwords is a modern sign of true love and commitment. While six in 10 snoops have caught their partner cheating on them or talking to someone they shouldn't be, more than a third have scuppered a romantic surprise their loved one was planning. The study of 2,000 Britons, commissioned by Samsung, found almost half have gone through a partner's phone in at least one relationship they've been in, with 16 per cent admitting they have done this with pretty much everyone they have been with. Furthermore, 40 per cent regularly snoop through their current partner's mobile to keep an eye on what they are doing or who they are talking to. Women are the most likely to check a partner's phone compared to men, with 44 per cent admitting to it. It doesn't always go to plan though as 34 per cent have ended up ruining a surprise their partner is planning for them, stumbling across their plans for a holiday, weekend away, gift or even a proposal, plus 44 per cent of said snoops have been caught in the act when going through their partner's phone. Text messages are most likely to be checked, followed by their call history, Facebook private messages, emails and even their photo gallery. Internet history and Twitter conversations are also among the things looked at by suspicious people. 1. Text messages. 2. Call history. 3. Facebook private messages. 4. Emails. 5. Photo gallery. 6. Internet history. 7. WhatsApp history. 8. Twitter private messages. 9. Viber history. 10. Skype history. But six in 10 of those who snoop have found inappropriate text messages, Facebook messages, phone calls or internet searches on at least one of their partner's mobiles. When it comes to confessing about their find, 32 per cent would confront their other half even if it meant owning up to their snooping, while a clever 18 per cent would find a way to bring it up without having to admit how they found out. Whilst 23 per cent would keep it to themselves, but keep a closer eye on their partner, 17 per cent would try and forget about it as they shouldn't have been snooping in the first place. Almost one in 20 would break up with their partner immediately. While 27 per cent said their other half wasn't bothered, as they had nothing to hide, 40 per cent said they were angry and 24 per cent said they broke up with them there and then. The phone company commissioned the research for the new Samsung Galaxy A-Series smartphone range. A spokesperson for Samsung Electronics UK & Ireland said:. 'Rather amusingly this research shows that suspicious partners seem to be using them quite regularly to check up on their other half on a regular basis. 'As we head towards the Valentine's season however, it's worth bearing in mind that you might discover something your partner is trying to keep hidden for all the right reasons, such as a secret weekend away they are planning, a special gift or perhaps even a marriage proposal!' Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"This is a story about how sometimes, when people leave their phones alone, others might secretly take a peek.

Esma Redzepova-Teodosievska (Macedonian: Esma Redzhepova-Teodosievska Macedonian pronunciation: ['esma re'dZepova teo'dosiefska]; 8 August 1943 - 11 December 2016) was a Macedonian vocalist, songwriter, and humanitarian of Romani ethnicity. Because of her prolific repertoire, which includes hundreds of songs, and because of her contribution to Roma culture and its promotion, she was nicknamed Queen of the Gypsies. In 1956, Esma's headteacher suggested she sing at a school talent contest for Radio Skopje. She went there without telling her parents, who did not want her to follow the path of an older sister who started to sing in cafes at 17. Among Roma people, such a career was viewed as shameful for an unmarried girl. Esma performed A bre babi, a Macedonian Roma traditional song. It was the first time a song in Romani was aired by the station. Esma won the contest, beating 57 other schools and winning 9,000 dinars. When Esma's parents learned about her success, they were extremely upset and reluctant to let her follow a musical career. At that time, the only possible career for Roma singers was to perform in cafes and restaurants with no other prospect. Stevo Teodosievski, an ethnic Macedonian musician and band frontman, was impressed by Esma's performance at the contest and wanted her to join his musical ensemble. Teodosievski was a self-taught man coming from a poor background, leading a large folk ensemble, the Ansambl Teodosievski. He also worked for Radio Skopje and was a member of the League of Communists of Macedonia. Being part of the local establishment, Teodosievski was also a visionary because he believed that Roma music could become esteemed and popular among non-Romani people. Indeed, at that time, Roma music in Yugoslavia was depreciated and not considered suitable for radio or television. Furthermore, racism against Roma people was very common in Macedonia and the rest of Yugoslavia and Roma people themselves had a poor image of Roma singers, especially female ones. Before Esma, Roma performers never sang in Romani on radio or television and always hid their origins. Teodosievski had been promoting Roma music even before meeting Redzepova and had faced severe criticism from the media for doing so. He knew however that Esma Redzepova could help him achieve his goal and that she could easily become one of the most prominent artists in the country. He convinced Esma's parents to let her go with him and join his ensemble. They both promised that Esma would only sing on reputable scenes. When they met in Skopje, Stevo Teodosievski was not fully satisfied with Esma's voice, and encouraged her to train for long hours. He enrolled her at the Academy of Music in Belgrade, where she stayed for two years.

You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Problem:The film opens to the sound of a gramophone playing Axxon N, \\"the longest-running radio play in history\\". Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the \\"Lost Girl\\", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girlâs television displays a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are laugh track responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout Inland Empire.The main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace (Dern), who has applied for a comeback role as Sue in a film entitled On High in Blue Tomorrows. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman (Zabriskie) who says she is her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, \\"caused evil to be born.\\" The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, \\"discovers a palace.\\" The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler (Ian Abercrombie) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek (Peter J. Lucas) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk (Theroux) receive an interview on a talk show. The host (Ladd) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them respond negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart (Irons). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled 47. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.Immersed in her character, while the film is being shot, \\"Sue\\" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / \\"Billy\\". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked Axxon N, and enters. It leads her back to soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the roomââshe herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy (possibly her husband in the film's story, but this is never made clear). Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, \\"Billy.\\"At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's \\"Smithy\\" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.Prior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billyâs wife tells a policeman that she had been hypnotised to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in ÅÃ³dÅº during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, \\"Who is she?\\" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and \\"say whether you've known me before.\\" In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her childhood sexual abuse, disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be \\"good with animals.\\" There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced sheâs being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.Finally, Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard, and is startled to see her doppelgÃ¤nger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her \\"no more blue tomorrows.\\" Off-camera, Kingsley yells \\"Cut!\\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only On High in Blue Tomorrowsâencompassing some of the subplots of the filmâbut events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked \\"Axxon N\\". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.Nikki flees into a nearby roomâRoom 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.Nikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski, and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, \\"Sweet!\\" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen.

The ongoing crisis in Syria has become an increasing global concern, with the U.N. directing its focus on halting the violent clashes and fostering an environment conducive to diplomacy and peaceful negotiations. Since the onset of the Syrian conflict in 2011, the violence has spread like wildfire, causing immense suffering and loss of life among innocent civilians and combatants alike. The conflict has grown increasingly more complex with the involvement of different nations and factions, further complicating the potential for a peaceful resolution. As pressure mounts on the international community to intervene and put an end to the bloodshed, the arrival of the Head of the U.N. mission in Syria serves as a vital step in addressing this urgent issue. The primary objective of the U.N. mission's presence in Syria is the establishment of a framework facilitating peaceful dialogue among warring factions. This framework, it is hoped, will provide an opportunity for these groups to discuss their differences and explore the possibility of a peaceful coexistence free from the specter of violence that has long plagued the region. Additionally, the U.N. mission aims to monitor and document human rights abuses while working to address the humanitarian crisis faced by millions of refugees and internally displaced persons. Arriving in Syria, the Head of the U.N. mission is expected to meet with political and military leaders, as well as representatives from different opposition groups, in an attempt to create a roadmap for dialogue and peace-building initiatives. By engaging with key players on all sides of the conflict, the U.N. seeks to establish a common ground on which future discussions can be based. The visit of the Head of the U.N. mission comes amid a backdrop of escalating violence in Syria. Recent weeks have seen attacks on civilians and humanitarian convoys, further exacerbating an already dire situation. The situation for the Syrian people has been catastrophic, with various forces and factions vying for control and using brutal tactics to gain grounds in this protracted conflict. In addition to fostering dialogue, the U.N. mission will also be providing humanitarian assistance to those displaced by the violence. Working in conjunction with local and international partners, the U.N. mission is dedicated to alleviating the suffering of Syrian civilians. This includes facilitating access to medical care and basic necessities, such as food, water, and shelter. Despite the challenges faced, the imminent arrival of the Head of the U.N. mission in Syria symbolizes the unwavering commitment of the international community to seek a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict. While ceasefires and peace agreements have been implemented in the past only to crumble under the weight of continued violence, the presence of the U.N. mission in the region is an essential step in attempting to resolve this humanitarian catastrophe once and for all. Only with sustained international pressure and continued dialogue can a long-term solution be achieved to bring an end to the bloodshed and displacement that has blighted Syria and its people for more than a decade. The world watches with bated breath as the U.N.'s efforts continue to make significant strides towards achieving a lasting peace for the war-torn nation."},{"question":"The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts.

Article: ARLANDA, Sweden (Reuters Life!) - Many people hate the idea of having to sleep on a plane. But Swedish entrepreneur Oscar Dios thinks they can be persuaded otherwise and he has created a new kind of hostel to prove it. Dios says it is the world's first jumbo (unusually large) jet hostel, an actual jet-plane at Sweden's main airport outside Stockholm which has been changed into a 25- room guesthouse that sleeps as many as 72 people. \\"I learned about this plane that was standing deserted at Arlanda airport and I've been trying the concept of hostels in many different houses and buildings,\\" he told Reuters. \\"I thought, 'Why not a plane?'\\" Jumbo Hostels opened for business on Thursday, giving customers the chance to check in and sleep in a room that can best be described as comfortable.\\" \\"The most challenging part with this project is trying to build something inside a metal hull - it's just really, really tight.\\" The jet, which was originally produced for Singapore Airlines, was taken out of service in 2002. It is held on a concrete foundation with the landing gear secured in steel cradles. One feature of the hostel is its price - a room starts at 350 Swedish crowns (about 41), which is a lot less than hotel rooms outside of major airports. Another feature is that customers can get married on the wing of the plane and stay in the plane's more luxurious honeymoon suite . Instead of walking down the aisle in the church, lovebirds can take what Jumbo Hostels calls the \\"wing walk,\\" where they can be joined in great happiness at the wing tip. The hostel has someone ready to perform the ceremony. But in some respects this hostel remains a plane - most customers have to share the jet's nine bathrooms and the staff only wear air host and hostess outfits. The only room that has its own bathroom is the honeymoon suite. Question: One of the features of the plane hostel is that _ . Options: A: customers can sleep in comfortable rooms B: air hostesses can offer good service C: a wedding ceremony can be held on the wing D: the staff can have a \\"wing walk\\" Answer:","response":"C: a wedding ceremony can be held on the wing In the article, it is mentioned that the Jumbo Hostels, created by Oscar Dios, offers a unique feature for customers to get married on the wing of the plane. To add further novelty to the experience, instead of walking down the conventional church aisle, couples can have a \\"wing walk\\" which is a walk down the airplane wing. The article also notes that the hostel has someone ready to perform the ceremony. This feature, coupled with a more luxurious honeymoon suite in the plane, makes the hostel a unique choice for those looking to tie the knot in a distinctive setting. Furthermore, it's depicted as part of an effort to make use of a decommissioned jet in a creative and innovative way, serving both an ecological and a business purpose. However, it's also worth noting that other provided options, such as 'customers can sleep in comfortable rooms', can also be considered features of the plane hostel. The plane has been converted into a 25-room guesthouse that is described as comfortable and sleeps up to 72 people, with rooms starting at an affordable price. But as the question specifically asks for one feature, the most unique one highlighted in the article is the capacity to hold a wedding ceremony on the plane's wing."},{"question":"Given the question: An animal requires energy to move, and all foods provide energy.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers loved geology. Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location.

Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of from us.

His trackers think that might be intentional, showing his face in a ploy to taunt them or play games. And he has left behind clues: Serbian cigarettes and soiled diapers, the kind snipers wear when preparing to settle in a spot for a long time. As they revealed new details Wednesday about accused trooper-killer Eric Frein, state police would not say that he was in their grasp. But in their most expansive comments in days, they signaled that the manhunt - aided by nearly 1,000 officers, agents, and others - was getting closer. The search area has narrowed to five square miles of woods not far from Frein's parents' home. \\"In some ways, I almost think that some of this is a game to him,\\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens, who has been leading the hunt. Investigators said they have found a trail of items they believe the 31-year-old \\"survivalist\\" may have abandoned between the police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pike County, where he allegedly shot two troopers Sept. 12, killing one, and the dense woods near his parents' home in Canadensis, Monroe County, 15 to 20 miles away. Bivens would not elaborate, but the diapers fit the profile of Frein that police have suggested: a man who spent months or even years plotting his retreat into the Poconos. \\"With the sniper training that he received, or self-taught, that is one of the techniques we know that he's read about, to try to stay in position for a longer period of time,\\" Bivens said. \\"He believes that is something he should do.\\" He said officials would run DNA tests on the diapers to verify that they were Frein's. The cigarette packages found in the woods were the Serbian brand Drina. Police have said Frein was aligned with a group described as Eastern European military \\"enthusiasts\\" and reenactors of Cold War-era warfare. The FBI, which has placed Frein on its 10 Most Wanted list, said he claimed to have fought with Serbians in Africa. Police receive daily reports of gunshots in the area, but officials cannot be sure they are coming from Frein. He has abandoned an AK-47-style rifle, they said, but likely still carries the .308-caliber rifle he allegedly used in the ambush that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounded Trooper Alex Douglass. Despite several sightings, officers have not fired at Frein, Bivens said. They would need to positively identify him, and he would have to refuse to surrender before police would use lethal force, Bivens said. He also said police have kicked bears out of their caves and enlisted locksmiths to break into cabins and houses during the search. He asked for the public's help identifying abandoned houses, bunkers, or cabins in the woods where Frein might be hiding. And he asked that people with trail cameras in the area check them for any sign of the suspected gunman. Flanked by two other officers and facing dozens of reporters at the Blooming Grove Township building, Bivens talked and took questions for nearly 30 minutes, longer than he has in days. Nearby, satellite trucks lined the country roads. Tips continue to flow in, including some from out of state, although Bivens said Frein has likely not left the woods of Monroe and Pike Counties. Though the primary search has narrowed, its perimeters are frequently shifting, and Bivens said he could not rule out the possibility that Frein could slip through. \\"It's time to surrender before this gets any worse for him. Before he gets hurt or worse, he needs to surrender,\\" he said. \\"We're not going away. And we'll be here until we apprehend him.\\" bfinley@phillynews.com 610-313-8118 @Ben_Finley ||||| Police hunting accused cop killer Eric Frein have spotted him several times, but always too far away to be apprehended, police said today.

Frein is accused of shooting two Pennsylvania state troopers on Sept. 12. One trooper died and the other was wounded. Bivens said nearly 1,000 officers are involved in the dragnet, which is concentrated near the Delaware State Forest in Pennsylvania. Both civilians and law enforcement officers believe they've spotted Frein, he added. Some people said the suspect, a self-trained survivalist, was wearing black. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Police have also found empty packs of Serbian cigarettes and soiled diapers they believe belonged to the suspect, who likes to reenact Eastern European battles. \\"We continue to find evidence of Frein's presence,\\" Bivens said at a press conference today, adding that the items are being tested for DNA. \\"We're in the right area, it's only a matter of time before we apprehend him,\\" he added. Bivens said the diapers are a survivalist technique used \\"to be able to stay in position for a longer period of time.\\" There have also been reports of gunshots in the area, none fired by law enforcement, he said. \\"Lethal force is authorized upon positive identification if he is not actively surrendering,\\" Bivens said. Jake Danna Stevens/The Times-Tribune/AP Photo Police believe Frein has traveled about 15 to 20 miles on foot since ditching his Jeep in a swamp near the barracks. Their search is focused on a few square miles near the borders of Pike and Monroe counties in a heavily wooded area of Pennsylvania. \\"There are many caves, small caves,\\" Bivens said. \\"We have bears in many of those caves. That's certainly a factor in those searches. We've kicked out bears and other wildlife.\\" Troopers are looking for abandoned or seasonal homes or sheds and asking the public to contact police if they see a garage door ajar or broken windows. They've also executed search warrants on several vacant homes. Bivens said Frein's family, from Canadensis, Pennsylvania, has been cooperating with authorities and they have no reason to believe the suspect has any accomplices. They have interviewed the suspect's relatives and members of the war reenactment community he was part of. Colleagues have described Frein as \\"very serious\\" about war reenactment and obsessed with the military and guns. Jake Danna Stevens/The Times-Tribune/AP Photo \\"He was goofy but dark,\\" filmmaker Patrick Bresnan said of Frein, who acted in his upcoming documentary, \\"Vietnam Appreciation Day.\\" Frein is accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and critically wounding another trooper, Alex Douglass, when police say he opened fire at the barracks, and then fled into the woods. His father, a retired Army major, later told police that two weapons were missing from his home, a .308 with a scope and an AK-47 assault rifle. Police scouring the woods have found an AK-47 and ammunition that they believe Frein either abandoned or had stashed.

The residents are convinced that Nick is in town on an investigation, despite Nick's repeated denials. However, when aircraft factory employee Peter Berton (Ralph Brooks) seeks out Nick and is shot dead before he can reveal anything, Nick is on the case. An old childhood friend, Dr. Bruce Clayworth (Lloyd Corrigan), performs the autopsy and extracts a pistol bullet. Then, when Nick searches Berton's room for clues, he is knocked unconscious by Crazy Mary (Anne Revere), a local eccentric. Nora's innocent purchase of a painting for Nick's birthday present turns out to be the key to the mystery. When she shows it to her husband, it brings back unpleasant memories for him, so she donates it to a charity bazaar. When Edgar Draque (Leon Ames) offers Nora a large sum for the painting, Nick wonders why it is so valuable. Nick learns that Draque's wife Helena (Helen Vinson) bought the artwork, but she is knocked out and the painting disappears. Nick discovers that Crazy Mary is Berton's mother and goes to see her, only to come across her lifeless body. Nick and Nora's dog Asta finds the painting in her shack. Nick puts the pieces together and has the police bring all the suspects to his father's house.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When initially considering the possibility of a human surviving without the consumption of water or any liquids, it may seem implausible, given that water is essential for life. However, in an attempt to justify this answer, one might explore alternative ways the human body might obtain the required amount of water to ensure survival. Firstly, the body consists of approximately 60% water, making it a vital component for important bodily functions such as digestion, absorption of nutrients, regulation of body temperature, and circulation. As a result, it seems unlikely that a person could bypass the necessity for water consumption. Secondly, one might consider if it's possible for the human body to obtain enough water from solid foods alone. While certain foods, such as fruits and vegetables, have high water content, they don't typically provide the recommended daily amount of water intake, which is around 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters for women. Moreover, most people consume a balance of both solid foods and liquids, making it difficult to rely solely on solid foods for hydration. Thirdly, in order to justify the answer \\"no,\\" it's essential to consider any scientific research or examples of people surviving without the consumption of water. Although rare cases have been reported where people have survived for extended periods without water, they are often highly exceptional, involving extreme circumstances, and not representative of regular human function. For example, some monks or spiritual practitioners might engage in long periods of fasting where they abstain from drinking water; however, this isn't a viable long-term solution and they still must drink water eventually, to prevent severe dehydration and eventually, death. Taking these points into account, the answer to the question of whether a human can survive without drinking any water or consuming any liquids is ultimately \\"no.\\" The human body relies on water to function properly, and although there may be limited instances where a person can temporarily avoid consuming water, it is not sustainable for a healthy life."},{"question":"Nous devons promouvoir notre programme sur la sécurité énergétique.

The band consisted of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. NME named the Smiths the \\"most influential artist ever\\" in a 2002 poll. Context: The band next approached the record company EMI for a contract, but were turned down. Morrissey and Marr subsequently visited London to hand a cassette of their recordings to Geoff Travis of the independent record label Rough Trade Records. Although not signing them to a contract straight away, he agreed to cut their song \\"Hand in Glove\\" as a single. Morrissey insisted that the cover image on the single was a homoerotic photograph by Jim French which he had found in Margaret Walters' The Nude Male. The single was released in May 1983, and would sell well for the next 18 months although never made it into the UK Top 40. This coincided with the band's second gig in London, at the University of London Union. Present at the gig was John Walters, the producer of John Peel's Radio 1 show; interested, he invited the band to record a session for the programme. Peel expressed the view that \\"I was impressed because unlike most bands... you couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\\" Following this radio exposure, the band gained their first interviews, in music magazines NME and Sounds. The Smiths then agreed to sign a record contract with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract. Only Morrissey and Marr signed it on behalf of the band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case. To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in Troy Tate of The Teardrop Explodes, and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, at the Elephant Studios in Wapping, East London. Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, John Porter. The band soon generated controversy when Gary Bushell of The Sun tabloid alleged that their B-side \\"Handsome Devil\\" was an endorsement of paedophilia. The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song \\"has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting\\". The follow-up singles \\"This Charming Man\\" and \\"What Difference Does It Make?\\" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and David Jensen at BBC Radio 1, the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base. Question: Did they end up redoing it? Answer:","response":"Yes, the Smiths ended up redoing their first album after Rough Trade Records was unhappy with the initial version produced by Troy Tate. The record label ordered the band to redo the album with a new producer, John Porter. Under John Porter's supervision, the band re-recorded their first album, which was eventually released with the title \\"The Smiths\\" in February 1984. This debut album became a critical and commercial success, truly marking the beginning of the Smiths' influential career in the music industry."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Inwood is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan, at the northern tip of Manhattan Island, in the U.S. state of New York. - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Mozart children were not alone as 18th-century music prodigies. Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\\". A family friend, the poet Johann Andreas Schachtner, recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable piano concerto, and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch.

The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour.

It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip. The officer said when he picked the man up at the station; he looked at the officer and smiled. He recognized his neighbor. This frail elderly man surely did not remember this selfless act of kindness. But it made a lasting impression on me, and on what it means to be a good cop.

Following his death, there appeared to be substantial concern regarding the manner in which ensuing investigations were handled. These investigations were overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, a body expected to operate its duties impartially and to maintain the highest level of professionalism. Unfortunately, there were allegations surrounding the investigation carried out by this Commission, which became a topic of contention. The conduct of the investigation was deemed as flawed, which led to considerable dissatisfaction among Mr. Lewis's family and possibly others who had keenly followed the circumstances surrounding his unfortunate demise. This dissatisfaction eventually led to the family calling for a judicial review. A judicial review is typically requested when there are concerns over the legality of decisions made by a public body. In this scenario, it can be inferred that the family of Mr. Lewis were not convinced about the conclusions drawn, or the methods employed, in the investigation carried out by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Therefore, the announcement of a judicial review in this case was perceived as a triumph by Mr. Lewis's family, likely because they felt that this would pave the way for a more thorough, independent, and just review of the circumstances leading to his death, which was not satisfactorily provided earlier by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. They might be hoping this review would bring clarity about the events that led to Mr. Lewis’s death, possibly leading to a sense of closure and justice.

Write a brief summary in a sentence or less","response":"Foreign automakers in the southern U.S. stand to benefit significantly if Detroit-based automakers fail, leading to increased market share for companies like Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen. In the past few decades, various foreign automakers have chosen the southern United States to establish their U.S. operations. This strategic decision has provided these companies with a range of advantages, which may become more pronounced if America's three Detroit-based automakers—General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles—are unable to compete effectively and cede their market share to competitors such as Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen. One factor that foreign automakers have capitalized on is the relatively lower labor costs in the southern United States. By establishing plants in states with right-to-work laws, these companies can avoid the higher wages and stringent work rules often associated with unionized workforces. Moreover, the southern states offer various incentives in the form of tax breaks and other benefits to attract such businesses, further reducing operational costs and improving the bottom line. Another advantage is the geographical proximity to major markets and transportation networks in the U.S. By having production facilities in the southern United States, foreign automakers can more efficiently deliver their vehicles and parts to dealerships and suppliers throughout the country. This not only reduces transit times but also mitigates potential supply chain disruptions which can damage profitability and brand reputation. Given these advantages, foreign automakers that have invested in the southern United States could stand to benefit significantly from the hypothetical decline of Detroit's Big Three. As customers shift their preferences towards more fuel-efficient, technologically advanced vehicles, companies like Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen have continuously demonstrated their ability to adapt to changing market conditions. These automakers are positioned to increase their market share as they continue to develop highly competitive products that cater to the demands of American consumers. Moreover, the failure of Detroit-based automakers could lead to further consolidation within the industry, with foreign automakers potentially acquiring the assets, technologies, and intellectual property of their failing counterparts. This would enable these businesses to expand their product portfolio and, in turn, strengthen their market presence. Lastly, a shakeup in the American automotive industry might prompt greater investment in research and development, electric vehicles, and autonomous driving technologies among foreign automakers. With less competition from the Big Three, these companies could feel more compelled to differentiate themselves from the remaining players in the market by offering innovative products and services, thus fostering a new wave of technological advancements in the automotive sector. In conclusion, foreign automakers like Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen—which have established their U.S. operations in the southern states—may gain significant benefits in the long run if the Detroit-based automakers fail. These advantages include increased market share, potential asset acquisition, and greater investment in innovation, positioning them for future growth and success in the United States."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a post in English from online platforms.

Will I secure an admission with 5.5 band in university who required 6.5 band? Would I get an admission with 5.5 band in university who required 6.5 band?","response":"Both questions essentially ask the same thing but are phrased differently using \\"Will I\\" and \\"Would I.\\" They inquire about the likelihood of securing admission to a university with an IELTS score of 5.5 when the required band score is 6.5. While there might be a slight difference in tone, both questions aim to understand the feasibility of getting accepted into the university with a lower-than-required score. However, it is important to address your concern regarding the possibility of getting admission with a 5.5 band score when the university necessitates 6.5. Generally, universities set their required IELTS scores based on the language proficiency they expect from incoming students to ensure academic success and effective communication during the course of study. An IELTS score is a key determining factor for admission in numerous international universities, particularly for students whose first language is not English. Although, theoretically, the chances of being admitted with a 5.5 band score in a university requiring a 6.5 band score are relatively low, you can still consider the following factors: 1. Alternative test scores: Some universities accept alternative English proficiency test scores, such as TOEFL or PTE. If you have a better score in any of these tests, you can use the scores as a substitution. 2. Foundation or pathway programs: In some cases, universities offer conditional admission if you agree to participate in a foundation or pathway program. These programs are designed to help learners improve their English proficiency and academic skills before embarking on their main course of study. 3. University-specific requirements: Every university has its policies and may consider applicants on a case-by-case basis. Some universities may offer some flexibility depending on your overall academic profile, such as high grades, extracurricular activities, recommendations, or other relevant experience. 4. Explaining your case: You can reach out to the university admission office or write a convincing letter explaining the reasons behind not meeting the required IELTS score and your genuine interest in the program. The university might take your situation into account and propose alternative methods to meet the requirements. In conclusion, the two questions you asked are relatively the same, as they both inquire about your possibility of securing an admission with an English proficiency score below the required mark. While it may be challenging to get admitted with a 5.5 band score in a university that requires a 6.5 band, some factors may help you improve your chances or meet the necessary criteria. It is essential to explore your options and communicate with your prospective university for personalized guidance."},{"question":"Asi jsem se dopustil troufalosti, když jsem ho pokládal za svůj vlastní.\\" Translate this to English?","response":"First, I will identify the language of the text provided.

One day, the village is attacked by Bulblins, who carry off the village's children with Link in pursuit before he encounters a wall of Twilight. A Shadow Beast pulls him beyond the wall into the Realm of Twilight, where he is transformed into a wolf and imprisoned. Link is soon freed by an imp-like Twilight being named Midna, who dislikes Link but agrees to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda. Zelda explains that Zant, the King of the Twilight, has stolen the light from three of the four Light Spirits and conquered Hyrule.

The text states that Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater musical in 1979 was the first collaboration between composer Alan Menken and writer Howard Ashman. This information implies that Menken did not work alone on this project, as he collaborated with Ashman to create the musical.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less air getting into the lungs happens, how will it affect there is more blood cells in the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have an indirect effect on the process. If there is less air getting into the lungs, it means that there is less oxygen available for the lungs to remove. Consequently, the oxygen supply in the bloodstream would decrease. With more red blood cells in the body, they would be competing for the limited supply of oxygen. This could potentially lead to a lowered oxygen delivery to the body's tissues, which could negatively impact cellular respiration and overall body function."},{"question":"Sentence 1: It's said to weigh 2,000 tons (1.8 million kg/4 million pounds). Sentence 2: It weighs less than 100 tons. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"If we consider the information provided in both sentences, it appears that these two statements are contradictory, making it difficult to determine if the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. According to Sentence 1, the object in question weighs 2,000 tons (1.8 million kg/4 million pounds). This suggests that the object is quite large and massive, requiring a substantial amount of effort or specialized equipment to handle, transport, or manipulate. In contrast, Sentence 2 claims that the same object weighs less than 100 tons. This statement presents a much smaller and lighter object that would still be considered heavy but is considerably more manageable than the object described in Sentence 1. Given the significant discrepancy between the weights provided in the two sentences, it is impossible to ascertain the true weight of the object based solely on the available information. However, assuming the first sentence is true and the object indeed weighs 2,000 tons (1.8 million kg/4 million pounds), then the second sentence cannot be true. This is because Sentence 1 already establishes that the object weighs significantly more than the upper limit of 100 tons provided in Sentence 2. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true and the object weighs 2,000 tons (1.8 million kg/4 million pounds), then the second sentence, claiming the object weighs less than 100 tons, is false. It is important to bear in mind that without further context or information, it is challenging to confirm with certainty the true weight of the object in question."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"Two children are sitting in some tree branches.\\", can we conclude \\"The children are outside.\\"? OPTIONS: 1. yes 2. it is not possible to tell 3. no","response":"Based on the information provided in the statement \\"Two children are sitting in some tree branches,\\" it is reasonable to infer that the children are outside. However, we always need to take into account the context and any additional information provided to draw a well-founded conclusion. Generally, we associate trees and tree branches with the outdoors, as they are naturally found in outdoor environments. There could be instances where a large tree is indoors, like in an enormous conservatory, or if a large indoor area has been constructed to accommodate a tree. These scenarios are typically rare and would require exceedingly unique circumstances. It is not practical to assume that tree branches mentioned in a general statement would be referring to an indoor setting. Considering the common understanding of trees being outdoor plants, we can lean towards the first option, which is 'yes.' One can safely deduce that the children sitting on tree branches are outside in the absence of any contradicting details. However, we should remain open to exceptions and the possibility of unique situations. In the end, the safest response would be to opt in favor of option 1, recognizing that there might be unusual scenarios that would not fit such a conclusion."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Newspapers in Great Britain _ greatly in their ways of carrying the news. There are serious papers for those who want to know about important happenings everywhere, both at home and abroad. There are popular newspapers for those who prefer entertainment to information. The London newspaper that is best known outside Great Britain is probably the Times. It began in 1785, and is well accepted for believable news and serious opinions on the news. It calls itself an independent paper, which means that it does not give its support to a particular political party. Its leading articles give the opinions of the editors, not those of the owners of the paper. Letters to the editor are printed in the newspaper. These parts of the Times are always interesting. Most of the letters are serious subjects. But from time to time there will be long letters on the subject which is not at all serious, perhaps on a new fashion of dress, or the bad manners of the young people, compared with manners of thirty years ago. Question: If you want to get pleasure, please buy yourself _ . Options: A: a serious newspaper B: foreign newspaper C: any independent paper D: a popular newspaper","response":"The answer to this question is D: a popular newspaper. Based on the provided passage from the article, there are two general categories for newspapers in Great Britain. Firstly, there are serious newspapers, which are designed for those who want news about important events happening globally, not just within the home country. This category of newspapers is more focused on providing detailed, in-depth reports from various news fields and is typically read by people seeking knowledge and understanding about worldwide happenings. The Times, as mentioned in the passage, falls into this category. On the other hand, there are popular newspapers, specifically made for those who favor entertainment over sheer information. These newspapers tend to be filled with lighter content, focusing less on hard news and more on topics that are entertaining. This might include features about celebrities, gossip, humour, lifestyle, and various other topics designed to amuse and entertain readers. When the article mentions 'popular newspapers', it implies these newspapers are for those who are seeking enjoyment or pleasure rather than strong, heavy-hitting news. Given this, the passage suggests that those individuals who want enjoyment from their newspaper reading experience are better suited to buying a popular newspaper. So, for the question 'If you want to get pleasure, please buy yourself _ ?', the correct fill in the blank would be 'D: a popular newspaper.' This is because, according to the article, that's the type of paper most closely associated with entertainment and pleasure rather than in-depth, informational reporting."},{"question":"- issue is joanna of brabant john henry godfrey , duchess of brabant margaret of brabant marie - death place is brussels - title is duke of brabant duke of lothier duke of limburg - mother is margaret , princess of england - spouse is marie d'Évreux - death date is 5 december 1355 - titles is the duke of brabant , lothier and limburg - father is john ii , duke of brabant - image is jan3brabant.jpg - birth place is 1300 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.","response":"The information provided seems to be about John III, Duke of Brabant."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Cocum eatType pub; Cocum priceRange less than £20; Cocum customer rating average; Cocum familyFriendly yes","response":"In the Cocum pub, where people like to eat, the food is not too expensive because it costs less than £20, most customers think it's just okay, not amazing, but not bad either, and it's a great place for families with kids because they make sure everyone can have fun together."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

Come December however, it's an entirely different story. The time of year generally connected with joy and cheer can be unbelievably stressful. From buying Christmas presents to ransacking grocery stores in preparation for family gatherings, December is a month that traditionally includes spending a lot of time and money in overcrowded shopping centers and supermarkets. What's worse than this pre-Christmas rush are the sales that happen in its wake. Every year in Britain, Canada and Australia, Boxing Day sales bring thousands of shoppers to malls and department stores. Attracted by the promise of impressive price reductions, some people start lining up outside stores the night before sales even begin. This year, during the US' post-Thanksgiving \\"Black Friday\\" sales, 20 were injured after a woman, too eager for a discounted Xbox video game, squirted pepper spray inside a Walmart.

His father, Thomas Francis O'Brien, is a physician, epidemiologist, and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. His mother, Ruth O'Brien (nee Reardon), is a retired attorney and former partner at the Boston firm Ropes & Gray. O'Brien attended Brookline High School, where he served as the managing editor of the school newspaper, The Sagamore. O'Brien moved to Los Angeles after graduation to join the writing staff of HBO's Not Necessarily the News. He was also a writer on the short-lived The Wilton North Report. He spent two years with that show and performed regularly with improvisational groups, including The Groundlings. In January 1988, Saturday Night Live's executive producer, Lorne Michaels, hired O'Brien as a writer. During his three years on Saturday Night Live (SNL), he wrote such recurring sketches as \\"Mr. Short-Term memory\\" and \\"The Girl Watchers\\"; the latter was first performed by Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz. O'Brien also co-wrote the sketch \\"Nude Beach\\" with Robert Smigel, in which the word \\"penis\\" was said or sung at least 42 times. While on a writers' strike from Saturday Night Live following the 1987-88 season, O'Brien put on an improvisational comedy revue in Chicago with fellow SNL writers Bob Odenkirk and Robert Smigel called Happy Happy Good Show. While living in Chicago, O'Brien briefly roomed with Jeff Garlin. In 1989, O'Brien and his fellow SNL writers received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series. O'Brien, like many SNL writers, occasionally appeared as an extra in sketches; his most notable appearance was as a doorman in a sketch in which Tom Hanks was inducted into the SNL \\"Five-Timers Club\\" for hosting his fifth episode. O'Brien returned to host the show in 2001 during its 26th season. O'Brien and Robert Smigel wrote the television pilot for Lookwell starring Adam West, which aired on NBC in 1991. The pilot never went to series, but it became a cult hit. It was later screened at The Other Network, a festival of unaired TV pilots produced by Un-Cabaret; it featured an extended interview with O'Brien and was rerun in 2002 on the Trio network. Things changed for O'Brien in 1991, when in quick succession, an engagement fell through; Lookwell was not picked up; and, burned out, he quit Saturday Night Live. \\"I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't come back to work and I just needed to do something else,\\" O'Brien recalled. \\"I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me.\\" Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then dual showrunners of The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls \\"everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired.\\" O'Brien was one of the first hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what was his favorite","response":"It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text what O'Brien's favorite quote, moment, or experience is.

Scott Forstall, a long-time lieutenant of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was asked to leave following years of friction with other top executives and his recent refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of the Apple's much-criticized mapping software, people familiar with the situation said. Sources said Forstall refused to sign a public apology after Apple's mapping product, which displaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce criticism.

The decision to let go of Forstall, an influential figure in the world of Apple, came after years of friction within the company's upper echelon and his unwillingness to publicly apologize for the shortcomings of their Maps software. Apple's Maps app was meant to rival Google Maps, which had dominated the map application space for years. However, upon its release in September, Apple Maps quickly became the subject of ridicule and frustration, as it contained numerous errors and failed to meet user expectations. In an attempt to address the widespread dissatisfaction, Apple sought to issue an apology to all users affected by the flawed product. However, when asked to sign the apology letter, Forstall refused, which ultimately led to his termination. Apple's decision to part ways with Forstall was a demonstration of their commitment to rectifying mistakes and upholding their reputation as a reliable and user-centric brand. Forstall's departure also led to a significant restructuring within the company, with various responsibilities being redistributed amongst other executives. This restructuring aimed to foster a more collaborative environment and discourage the internal conflicts that had arisen during Forstall's tenure. Ultimately, Apple hoped to promote a stronger sense of unity, cohesion, and direction moving forward, while reassuring users that they were taking the necessary steps to ensure the quality and reliability of future products and services."},{"question":"This product was added to our catalog on Sunday 10 June 2007 Could you correct the punctuation please?","response":"Sure.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers loved geology. Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location. Answer this question please: Which brother studied more about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup?

With Acomplia your appetite becomes normal and not as out of control . It is important to note that you should not result to starving yourself on the diet pill Acomplia , but eat reasonable amounts even if you do not have any appetite at all . Question: Why is it important to eat a normal amount , even if the drug has removed your apetite ?","response":"It is important to eat a normal amount even if the drug, such as Acomplia, has removed your appetite because of various essential factors for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These factors include nutrient requirements, energy balance, metabolism regulation, psychological well-being, and the prevention of potential side effects from the drug. 1. Nutrient requirements: Our body needs essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats to function properly. These nutrients are important for growth, repair and maintenance of body tissues, and supporting overall health. Eating a normal amount ensures that your body receives these crucial nutrients, allowing your body to perform its necessary tasks efficiently. 2. Energy balance: Food provides the energy needed to carry out our daily activities. If you starve yourself, your body does not receive enough energy to function, leading to fatigue, weakness, and reduced mental and physical performance. Eating a regular amount of healthy, nutrient-rich food maintains the body's energy balance, enabling you to maintain daily activities without experiencing exhaustion. 3. Metabolism regulation: Eating a normal amount of food helps to regulate the body's metabolism. When you starve yourself, your body switches to a starvation mode, reducing the overall metabolic rate to conserve energy. This can make it harder to lose weight in the long run. Furthermore, maintaining a consistent eating pattern helps prevent fluctuations in blood sugar levels, promoting better digestion and nutrient absorption. 4. Psychological well-being: Eating a normal amount of food is crucial for mental health and emotional well-being. Hunger and starvation can lead to mood swings, irritability, and increased stress levels, impacting overall mental health. A healthy, balanced diet has been shown to improve mood, increase energy levels, and contribute to a more positive mental outlook. 5. Prevention of potential side effects from the drug: While appetite suppressants like Acomplia can be helpful for weight loss, it is crucial to ensure you do not merely starve yourself in the process. Starvation can lead to malnutrition, muscle loss, and electrolyte imbalances, which can exacerbate existing health conditions or create new ones. It may also lead to a weakened immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and diseases. In summary, eating a normal amount of food, even when appetite has been suppressed, is crucial for maintaining overall health, meeting the body's nutrient and energy requirements, regulating metabolism, supporting mental health, and preventing potential adverse effects from relying solely on appetite suppressant drugs. It is essential to combine a healthy, balanced diet with regular physical activity for long-term weight management and overall well-being."},{"question":"Article: Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington died of an apparent suicide by hanging Thursday morning, according to The Associated Press.

Others, such as Thursday's Geoff Rickly and Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, took the opportunity to speak out about the importance of addressing mental health issues as well. \\"Chester Bennington was an artist of extraordinary talent and charisma, and a human being with a huge heart and a caring soul,\\" Warner Brothers Records CEO Cameron Strang said in a statement. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his beautiful family, his bandmates and his many friends. All of us at WBR join with millions of grieving fans around the world in saying: we love you Chester and you will be forever missed.\\" Bennington's screamed and emotional vocals provided a gritty counterpoint to co-frontman Mike Shinoda's raps on the group's nu-metal hits like \\"In the End\\" and \\"One Step Closer.\\" He sang the poppy melodies on the band's recent hit \\"Heavy,\\" which featured singer Kiiara and reached Number Two on Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart and Number 11 on the Top 40. In addition to working with Linkin Park, he also fronted Stone Temple Pilots between 2013 and 2015 and the side project Dead by Sunrise and supergroup Kings of Chaos. Linkin Park were a breakout hit when they released their debut, Hybrid Theory, in 2000. Its blend of rap, metal and electronic music propelled it to Number Two on Billboard, and the RIAA has subsequently certified it diamond, signifying sales of more than 10 million copies. With the exception of 2014's The Hunting Party, which debuted at Number Three, each subsequent Linkin Park release would claim the Number One spot. Over the years, they've proven themselves to be a malleable act, focusing more on electronic music sometimes and harder rock at others, and even teaming with Jay-Z on the platinum-selling Collision Course EP in 2004 and Steve Aoki on the remix release A Light That Never Comes in 2014. Their most recent LP, One More Light, came out this past May. The band has won two Grammys. Bennington was born March 20th, 1976 in Phoenix, the son of a police officer. He had a rough childhood and was molested and beaten up by an older friend beginning around age seven. \\"It destroyed my self-confidence,\\" he told Metal Hammer. \\"Like most people, I was too afraid to say anything. I didn't want people to think I was gay or that I was lying. It was a horrible experience.\\" When he was 11, his parents divorced and he was forced to live with his father. He eventually discovered drugs, taking opium, amphetamines, marijuana and cocaine alongside alcohol. \\"I was on 11 hits of acid a day,\\" he told the magazine in 2016. \\"I dropped so much acid I'm surprised I can still speak. I'd smoke a bunch of crack, do a bit of meth and just sit there and freak out. Then I'd smoke opium to come down. I weighed 110 pounds. My mom said I looked like I stepped out of Auschwitz. So I used pot to get off drugs. Every time I'd get a craving, I'd smoke my pot.\\" Related Musicians, Famous Fans React to Chester Bennington's Death Lars Ulrich, Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Nikki SIxx, Imagine Dragons, more share memories, condolences, thoughts on mental heath After a gang broke into a friend's house where he was getting high and pistol-whipped his friends, he ditched drugs in 1992, though addiction would creep back into his life later. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where he auditioned for the band that would become Linkin Park. The band had formed as Xero in Agoura Hills, California in 1996, the brainchild of Shinoda, guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, drummer Rob Bourdon and turntablist Joe Hahn. After Bennington, who had been fronting the Phoenix alt-rock band Grey Daze, replaced original vocalist Mark Wakefield, Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory lineup was set. Hybrid Theory came at the peak of the nu-metal explosion and quickly dominated the Billboard chart, thanks in part to heavy MTV airplay. The singles \\"One Step Closer,\\" \\"Crawling\\" and \\"In the End\\" all charted high on the mainstream rock chart, and \\"In the End\\" also crossed over to the pop chart, reaching Number Two and becoming gold-certified. \\"Crawling\\" earned the band its first Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. Their 2003 follow-up, Meteora, was also a swift Number One, thanks in part to the success of the platinum single \\"Numb,\\" which featured Bennington screaming about feeling turned off to the world. Their success led to a high-profile 2004 collaboration with Jay-Z, Collision Course – another Number One, platinum release that found them fusing their \\"Papercut\\" to his \\"Big Pimpin'\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\" to the rapper's \\"99 Problems.\\" Their mashup of Linkin Park's \\"Numb\\" and Jay-Z's \\"Encore\\" won them a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance. At the time of Linkin Park's early success, Bennington slipped back into addiction. \\"The tours we did in the beginning, everybody … was either drinking or doing drugs,\\" Shinoda once told The Guardian. \\"I can't think of any that were sober.\\" Bennington kicked drugs in 2006, though, and by the late 2000s, he was celebrating his sobriety and using it as fuel for his music. \\"It's not cool to be an alcoholic — it's not cool to go drink and be a dumbass,\\" he told Spin in 2009. \\"It's cool to be a part of recovery. ... Most of my work has been a reflection of what I've been going through in one way or another.\\" Linkin Park's 2007 album, Minutes to Midnight, found them moving away from the aggression of their earlier nu-metal releases. Co-producer Rick Rubin helped them focus more on classic rock with shades of U2. The risk made for the hits \\"What I've Done,\\" \\"Bleed It Out\\" and \\"Shadow of the Day,\\" all of which were certified platinum and multi-platinum. In 2005, Bennington had put together Dead by Sunrise, a side project of songs that he felt didn't fit Linkin Park's style. \\"They were darker and moodier than anything I'd come up with for the band,\\" he told Metal Hammer. \\"So I decided to work on them on my own.\\" The band's lineup also featured members of Orgy and the Street Drum Corps, and their debut, 2009's Out of Ashes, reached Number 29 on the Billboard chart. Linkin Park continued to blend atmospheric rock with electronics on 2010's A Thousand Suns (co-produced by Rubin) and 2012's Living Things. Despite the shift in sound, though, they were able to carry out the unlikely feat of claiming the Number One position on both the mainstream rock and alt-rock charts with 2012's \\"Burn It Down,\\" on which Bennington sang full-throated and clear-voiced. In 2013, he joined Stone Temple Pilots after the band fired frontman Scott Weiland. He'd previously performed the group's \\"Dead and Bloated\\" and \\"Wonderful\\" with them in 2001 on the Family Values Tour. They put out the EP High Rise that year and toured frequently over the next two years. He left the band in 2015 to devote his time to Linkin Park and to his family. \\"I got to create and perform with one of the greatest rock bands of our generation, that had so much influence on me growing up,\\" he said at the time. \\"With the amount of time STP deserves, in addition to being in Linkin Park, and with the needs of my family, one of them always seems to fall short.\\" He later played with STP's Robert DeLeo again in the Kings of Chaos, a touring supergroup that plays covers; its lineup also featured members of Guns N' Roses, the Cult, Slipknot and ZZ Top during Bennington's stint. Related Flashback: Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell Sing 'Hunger Strike' The two dear friends duetted on the Temple of the Dog classic when they toured together in 2008 Meanwhile, Linkin Park's 2014 LP The Hunting Party found them veering back toward harder rock to less commercial success. On their most recent album, this year's One More Light, they were exploring full-on pop. Facing a backlash from some older fans on how Linkin Park had softened its sound since Hybrid Theory, he told an interviewer, \\"It's a great record, we love it. Like, move the fuck on.\\" \\"Heavy,\\" which features Bennington trading catchy verses with 22-year-old singer and songwriter Kiiara, had only made it into the middle-half of the pop chart at the time of the singer's death, though the album had debuted at Number One. The band had recently performed the album's title track, \\"One More Light,\\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in tribute to Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, who had died of a suicide by hanging earlier this year. \\"Who cares if one more light goes out,\\" he sang. \\"Well, I do.\\" Linkin Park were slated to kick off a tour in support of One More Light beginning July 27th with Blink-182, Wu-Tang Clan and Machine Gun Kelly. Outside of his main projects, Bennington made guest appearances on songs by Santana, Young Buck, Mindless Self Indulgence, DJ Lethal, Mötley Crüe and Chris Cornell, among others. He also appeared in two Crank movies and in Saw 3D. Despite Linkin Park's commercial success and Bennington's well-received collaborations with Dead by Sunrise and Stone Temple Pilots, he always tried to stay grounded. \\"The idea that success equals happiness pisses me off,\\" he told Metal Hammer in 2016. \\"It's funny to think that just because you're successful you're now immune to the full range of the human experience. But we also realize that we're not kids any more; we're not youngsters with this teen angst and this feeling of 'why does the world piss me off?' and finding a way to express it. \\"We have had a lot of success and there are a lot of great things going on for us, but there are things that really matter to us,\\" he added. \\"When we talk about lyrical content we can't just go back to being that angry kid. We need to talk about something that makes sense to who we are today.\\" ||||| Chester Bennington, the ferocious lead singer for the platinum-selling hard rock band Linkin Park, was found dead in his home near Los Angeles on Thursday.

LINKIN PARK STARTED WRITING POPPIER MUSIC BEFORE THEIR LAST ALBUM Says Chester: “We actually started writing some really interesting pop music before we wrote ‘The Hunting Party’. We started down a pretty clear path of writing some pretty serious pop music. \\"Mike was giving me litmus tests like, ‘Hey, what would you say if I said… let’s do a collaboration with Katy Perry or Kelly Clarkson?’ and I was like, ‘Fuck yeah! I actually really like pop music.’ It was just a test to see if I’d go, ‘Absolutely not, that makes me want to puke’ or if I’d be open to the idea, and I’m pretty much open to anything.\\" AN AWFUL LOT HAPPENED BETWEEN 'THE HUNTING PARTY' AND 'ONE MORE LIGHT' \\"During 2015, 2016 – not only did I rehab my leg, but there was a bunch of other stuff in my personal life that just went fucking crazy. I spent a lot of those two years trying to hold my world together and everybody else was going through a lot of crazy shit too on a personal level.\\" \\"I think between going from all of that personal stuff, the band having some issues – not issues internally, but just a lot of life was happening and things kind of got weird for a minute for all of us personally – we had a lot of shit to get together before we went back out and started playing shows and doing stuff.\\" \\"We had to figure out what it was we wanted to do... ‘Where are we in our lives?’ It was like, ‘Let’s try something different creatively. Let’s work with some songwriters and bring them in' – we’ve never done that before.\\" THEY WROTE DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME AROUND \\"We started off all of our sessions with conversations about life and what we were going through. We also decided to do what Rick Rubin had been so passionately trying to get us to do the entire time we worked with him, which was start with lyrics and melodies first and then write tracks around those to support the melodies and the lyrics. \\"The combination of the outside writing, starting with melodies and lyrics and the conversations about what was going on in our lives really directed what this album sounds like. There’s a lot of fucking heavy stuff going on. I’m not saying it to be punny, there was a lot of really intense shit that we were all going through and we were all kind of searching for our muse, our intention. \\"Mike took it upon himself to write down all the stuff we’d talked about as friends on a piece of paper and all the shit we had gone through, and it was fucking crazy. You know that phrase – it’s gone bananas? It's not been bananas, it’s been a banana avalanche. It’s a fucking torrential downpour of bananas.\\" Check out Linkin Park's new song 'Heavy', featuring Kiiara. THEY'RE TAKING RISKS... BECAUSE THEY PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS HAVE \\"Starting from ‘Minutes To Midnight’ on, it’s like, ‘Let’s take some fucking risks’. If the songs are great, that should be all that matters. We feel like we’re pushing ourselves creatively. If we write a bunch of pop songs that suck, we’ve definitely taken a wrong turn, if we write a bunch of metal songs that suck, we’ve taken a wrong turn. \\"It doesn’t matter what style we write in, as long as it comes from a pure place and it’s something that we pour our hearts and souls into, we can deal with what happens from that point forward and we’re pretty confident that even if it may be shocking to some people – or even everybody at first – sometimes for us it was like, ‘We know we’re going to make a lot of people go, ‘What the heck is this? Who is this?’ and we also know we’re gonna make a lot of people go, ‘What the fuck happened to my band?’. \\"I think for us, creativity is way too big to be put in a box, and for us we’re not a one trick pony. We like to really play with our palette and expand our abilities as songwriters and performers, and that’s what we did on this record.\\" LINKIN PARK ARE STILL NOT NU METAL \\"We don’t want to be bound by a genre. It’s not like we hate nu metal music. What we hated was being branded as something. If it’s just hard rock, we’d be like, ‘are these people listening to the record?’ but we could equally be called a hip hop group, an electronic group, an alternative band. There are so many different parts to what we’re doing. That’s why we called it ‘Hybrid Theory’...\\" THIS ALBUM IS HEAVY \\"[One day in the studio] I was like, ‘Do you guys really want to fucking know what my day has been like?’ And someone was like, ‘Yes’. And I just came out and said some pretty fucking hardcore stuff. Somebody very close to me had tried to kill themselves, and I was dealing with the aftermath of that. Their lives are going to be different from that point on. They were like, ‘Damn...’. \\"I relate to that. And what’s crazy is that after seeing someone I care about go through that, the fact that I wanted to do that myself freaks me out, because it’s horrible. We got into that, and we started thinking about how we get stuck in these behaviours and patterns or how we can get trapped in our own stuff, and boom - we started writing a song. By the end of the day we had a song that everyone could relate to, that everyone felt comfortable with and everyone felt like they had this relief. \\"It also opened up a more intimate experience with these writers that came in who had no idea who we are as people. Talk about being vulnerable and just peeling the fucking scab off... When you feel like you can be real [in the studio] and that it’s a safe place, it’s the biggest relief. Going through every song in this way and going through all of our stuff... for me is going through all the process of doing everything I can to make my life better, like... where I’m at right now in 2017 is as far on the opposite side of the scale to where I was at this time in 2015. I literally hated life and I was like, ‘I don’t want to have feelings. I want to be a sociopath. I don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to care what other people feel like. I want to feel nothing’. \\"And now I’m like, ‘Bring it on!’ I hated living at this time in 2015, and I absolutely love it right now, and I don’t feel like it’s some manic back and forth. I feel like it was a legitimate breakdown of me as a human being and then going through all of the effort and hard work it takes to rebuild it and reaping the rewards. A huge part of that is being able to be open and honest and real with the people in my life, and that means my band members and being able to put it down in music and get it out... \\"Out is the best. Holding shit in? That’s really what ‘Heavy’ is about. Like, ‘What the fuck is going on with me? What am I doing to myself? What am I allowing others to cause inside of me to keep me stuck?’ That moment that you can separate yourself from the action or behaviour or circumstance and look at it and see it for what it is, you’ve made that first step in separating yourself from that and getting out of that. \\"That’s where the line, ‘If I just let go, I’d be set free’ comes from - that’s what ‘Heavy is about. When I’m opening that song saying, ‘I don’t like my mind right now’, that’s fucking real. It is not a safe place for me to be unless I’m doing what I need to do - taking care of myself, being real, being open, getting it out, taking all the steps to make myself whole, then it’s a pretty safe neighbourhood, but it goes bad real fast. It’s great to get that shit out. I recommend that everyone goes and writes their problems down on a piece of paper, takes it outside and fucking burns that shit. Talk to somebody about it. \\"I’m fortunate enough to be a member of some twelve-step programs, and we get in a room with a bunch of people who don’t know each other and we all talk about our lives. Regular people don’t have this in their life, they just carry their shit around. Getting in a room with a bunch of strangers and going, ‘Here’s what’s going on with me’ and then everyone either laughing about it or understanding you and giving you a hug at the end of the day and going, ‘Call me if you need anything’... any group of people can do that, but no one actually takes time to actually open up to people because they’re all afraid of what people think of them. \\"I’m at a place where I couldn’t give a fuck what people think of me. Go ahead - say what you want about me as a person, say what you want about me as an artist, I don’t give a fuck. I know exactly who I am, I know exactly what I’m made of and I’m totally happy with it. So it’s really great to be able to be doing what I do, especially for a person like me. If it wasn’t for music I’d be dead. One hundred per cent.\\" Linkin Park's new album 'One More Light' is out on May 19. Listen to new song 'Battle Symphony' below.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Juan Ibarra, the captain of the helicopter, told El Comercio that Bezos was vacationing on the islands. Captain Daniel Ginez Villacis, the regional director of the islands Coast Guard, said Bezos' family and business friends thanked the navy for their quick rescue. According to the Mayo Clinic, most kidney stones don't require surgery and can be passed by drinking water, pain relievers or other medicine.

After polishing off the mixed drink, the 18-year-old from Northern California started drinking beer at a party. After midnight, in what she describes as a stupor, she asked if someone could help her walk to her room on the campus in Northeast Washington. A male student she considered an acquaintance volunteered. She says she blacked out. Back in her room, Cavalier recalled, she regained awareness. The man was on top of her, she said, raping her. Cavalier said she was too drunk to agree to sex. “I never consented,” she said. The man saw it differently, telling investigators that Cavalier was a willing participant in a sexual encounter after he walked her home and she signed him into her dorm. The man was never charged with a crime, and an initial D.C. police report said evidence indicated there was mutual consent. But that was not nearly the end of it. What happened that night in December 2012 set off a chain of events that a year and a half later pushed the Vatican’s university in America into a fierce national debate over how colleges respond to allegations of sexual assault. In growing numbers, students such as Cavalier are stepping forward to force public scrutiny of an issue that has quietly affected colleges for decades. Some campus sex-assault cases are clear-cut. But many emerge from murky circumstances involving alcohol, parties and young adults living away from home for the first time. Under federal law, sexual violence on campuses is not only a crime but also a form of illegal discrimination requiring speedy remedy. Students are increasingly demanding action from their schools, which in turn face heightened pressure from the government to investigate and resolve the allegations. Reports of forcible sex offenses on college campuses nationwide grew from about 2,600 in 2009 to more than 3,900 in 2012, according to federal data, up 50 percent. That doesn’t mean campuses became that much more dangerous in those years; experts say students who in previous generations probably would have remained silent about what they experienced are now coming forward. Colleges, too, have become more thorough in documenting the problem and teaching students that incapacitation, through alcohol or drugs, prevents effective consent. The trend is likely to accelerate. President Obama drew public attention to campus sex assaults this year through a White House task force. Lawmakers have invited survivors of sex assaults to Capitol Hill to advise them on legislation. But there are at least two sides to every allegation. Brett A. Sokolow, president of the National Center for Higher Education Risk Management, said he worries that many students accused of sexual misconduct are “getting much less of a fair shake than they used to.” Accused students often say they are the victims. Sokolow said some cases that in years past would have been considered “drunk sex” are now being examined for disciplinary violations. Colleges, he said, “have got to get this thing just right.” Cavalier, now 20 and a rising junior, said she wants Catholic to reform how it responds to reports of sexual assault. “As a survivor,” she said, “I know how horrible it can go.” The Washington Post generally does not identify those who report being victims of sexual assault. But Cavalier chose to go public with her story to illuminate a complaint she filed with the federal government alleging that Catholic University mishandled her case, violating a 1972 law called Title IX that bars gender discrimination. The complaint alleges that Cavalier was unfairly “forced to lobby, argue and fight for a grievance hearing,” an internal misconduct trial held behind closed doors. Catholic initially decided a hearing was unwarranted but reversed itself after several months of back and forth with Cavalier and her representatives. A university hearing board concluded in October that there was insufficient evidence to find that Cavalier’s alleged attacker had violated the student conduct code. “The university is confident that it acted appropriately in investigating and resolving the issue that gave rise to the student’s complaint,” Catholic spokesman Victor Nakas said. Catholic, with 6,700 students, was founded under a papal charter in 1887. It is one of about 60 institutions of higher education under federal investigation for their handling of reports of sexual violence. They range from Harvard Law School and Princeton University to the Butte-Glenn Community College District in California and the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine, according to federal officials, who disclosed a comprehensive catalogue of investigations for the first time on May 1. Four Virginia schools are under investigation: the University of Virginia, the College of William and Mary, James Madison University, and the University of Richmond. So is Frostburg State University in Western Maryland. Federal investigations begin after individuals file complaints or the Education Department initiates a compliance review. Federal officials said they have drawn no conclusions that any of the schools are violating the law. After Catholic was named on the federal list, Cavalier recounted what happened to her on Dec. 15, 2012, and the aftermath, in an interview with The Post at her attorney’s office in downtown Washington. She signed a statement that waived her federal privacy rights — giving the university permission to disclose information about her case — but Catholic officials declined to discuss any specifics, citing the federal investigation and the school’s “obligations to both of the students who are parties to the matter.” The student Cavalier says raped her could not be reached through telephone calls to his family residence, and he did not respond to a message via Facebook. The Post is not identifying him because he has not been charged with a crime, and because of the university hearing board’s conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to find violations of the student conduct code. The man’s father said there is much more to the case than Cavalier’s version. “There are lots of facts not being brought out,” he said, declining to comment further. The sixth of seven children in her family, Cavalier attended Catholic schools while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area. She said she came to Catholic University to play lacrosse and also was drawn to its location in the nation’s capital. She belongs to the College Republicans, is majoring in politics and wants to explore careers in counterterrorism. On the Friday night after her first set of final exams, Dec. 14, 2012, Cavalier was doing laundry in her dorm, preparing to fly home. At about 9 p.m., she bumped into a friend who invited her to a gathering at another dorm. She believes she started drinking at 10 p.m. and stopped at about 12:30 a.m. at a party with about a dozen other students. It was something all too common on college campuses: a binge. Cavalier described herself that night as “blackout drunk,” saying she “obviously had way too much to drink, and it was not a good idea on my end.” She said she was almost falling asleep on a couch when she realized she needed to leave. “I kind of announced I would like someone to walk me home,” she said. She said she recalls little else until she realized she was being attacked in her bed. After the man left, Cavalier went into a bathroom. A resident assistant found her there, crying. “She asked what happened,” Cavalier said. “I said I had been raped.” A blur of activity ensued: The RA called for help. Campus police responded. She went to Washington Hospital Center and saw a nurse specializing in sexual-assault examinations. An advocate from Network for Victim Recovery of D.C. arrived to help. Cavalier called her parents. D.C. police interviewed her, and she said she decided not to seek criminal charges. “They literally asked me upfront while I was highly intoxicated and absolutely traumatized in every way,” Cavalier said. “The idea of going through a legal process sounded horrible.” But Cavalier disputed a D.C. police report filed at 3:03 a.m. that described the incident, according to a preliminary statement, as consensual sex. “While I cannot tell you exactly what I said that night to the police or really any other person, the people that I spoke to that night that I trust, my parents, my friends . . . have all told me that I said I was raped,” Cavalier said. “No consent.” Lindsey Silverberg, the advocate who joined Cavalier at the hospital, confirmed that account. A toxicology report from the hospital showed that at 8:28 a.m., Cavalier’s blood alcohol level was 0.097, above the 0.08 legal threshold for drunk driving. Because blood alcohol level eventually diminishes after a person stops drinking, Cavalier’s attorneys believe hers was at or above 0.2 at the time of the incident, a high level of intoxication. That afternoon, Cavalier flew home to California. Two days later, a Catholic administrator sent her an e-mail. “I wanted to check in and see how you were doing,” Rachel Wainer, an assistant dean of students, wrote on Dec. 17, according to a copy of the e-mail Cavalier provided. “I understand that you may have questions or concerns, and I would be more than happy to connect with you.” Cavalier replied a few days later, suggesting times to talk by phone that week. But she said she didn’t hear back from Wainer or anyone else throughout the winter break. When she returned to Washington, Cavalier e-mailed Wainer, asking to meet. “Now that I am back on campus,” she wrote on Jan. 14, 2013, “I would like to get back to this.” “We can absolutely meet today,” Wainer replied within a few minutes. “I am sorry we were not able to touch base before the University closed for the Christmas holiday.” The e-mail appears to confirm a four-week gap in communication between Catholic and Cavalier. Wainer declined to discuss the case. Lawrence J. Morris, Catholic’s general counsel and a retired Army colonel, also declined to comment on Cavalier’s case. But Morris said the university strives to connect quickly with any student who reports a sex assault, even during vacations. “You do your best to get to the person as immediately as we can,” he said, “and we persist regardless of what the immediate circumstances will be.” When Cavalier met with Wainer, the assistant dean explained her options: pursue a criminal charge, file an internal misconduct complaint, do both or do neither. Cavalier chose to seek internal discipline. On Jan. 16, campus police interviewed her. On March 20, the dean of students, Jonathan C. Sawyer, told her there was not enough evidence to hold a hearing on her complaint. The university, he said, would issue an order for the two students to avoid contact with each other and take other steps, if necessary, to preserve distance between them. Cavalier said she was stunned. Until that point, she had considered Catholic a neutral arbiter. But the dismissal of her complaint left her in doubt. “They didn’t even allow me to have a chance to prove that I was raped,” she said. “That’s the part that made me feel very alone.” Cavalier then connected with Matt Ornstein, a lawyer with the victim recovery network. He helped her obtain the toxicology report from the hospital and attached it to an appeal, saying the university should look at whether Cavalier had been too drunk to have the capacity to consent. On April 10, campus police reinterviewed Cavalier. Ornstein, who was present, said one of the investigators told Cavalier some alcoholics are able to consent to sex even though they are drunk. “I was upset when they explained that,” he said. “You know, Erin’s not . . . a 50-year-old career alcoholic who’s been dealing with these things her whole life and has developed some incredible tolerance or has some sort of natural immunity to alcohol.” Ornstein said the investigators were skeptical of Cavalier’s incapacitation claim because of what they viewed as a lack of corroboration from witnesses. The lawyer asked to see a report on what witnesses said. Investigators said they would forward his request. The case then stagnated. Cavalier continued her studies and did her best to avoid the other student on campus. In California, her parents were dismayed. The spring semester of 2013 was slipping away, and the issues seemed unresolved. “It was a long, frustrating period of time,” said her father, Mark Cavalier, a financial adviser. He flew to Washington in May and hired lawyer Kobie Flowers to explore legal options. On July 8, Ornstein obtained the internal report from campus police that he had requested in April. Cavalier and her attorneys said they were struck by statements from witnesses at the party that seemed to support her claim of drunken incapacitation, such as “she was staggering,” and she “was very drunk and falling asleep.” They scheduled a meeting with Sawyer and Morris on Aug. 21 to demand a hearing, with Cavalier’s father present. Almost immediately, Sawyer told them the university would grant their request. The approach of the Oct. 3 hearing underscored questions about how a university inquiry differs from a court of law: Who could attend? Who could ask questions? What were the rules of evidence? Who would judge? Catholic’s system, according to Morris, provides for a hearing board of four administrators or faculty members. The accuser and accused are given equal access to witness statements and other documents. During the closed and confidential proceedings, students must speak for themselves but are allowed to have a lawyer with them as an adviser. Only the board is allowed to question witnesses, but the accuser and the accused may suggest questions through notecards. The board decides cases on a standard of “preponderance of the evidence” — that is, whether it is more likely than not that a student broke the university’s rules. The standard — lower than the “beyond reasonable doubt” burden of proof for a criminal conviction — follows federal guidance issued in 2011. Critics say the preponderance standard is unfair to the accused. Morris said the goal of the process is to “remove or diminish any obstacles” to delivery of the best possible educational experience. “Remember, it is unrealistic for a university investigative and adjudicative process to bring perfect justice in these cases,” he said. Public courts of law, he said, are better equipped for that task. Cavalier said Catholic failed to make clear with enough advance notice that her parents were entitled to attend the hearing in the university’s Pryzbyla student center. They couldn’t make it; Flowers and Ornstein accompanied her. The hearing lasted about six hours, Cavalier said. She sat across the room from the accused student. The board issued a verdict six days later, finding that “no force was involved,” that Cavalier was “not incapable of giving consent,” and that the male student “would not reasonably have thought” that Cavalier was incapacitated or unable to give consent. The man was cleared. On Dec. 20, Cavalier filed an eight-page Title IX complaint with the Office for Civil Rights of the Education Department. The federal investigation began on Jan. 8. A key question is whether Catholic’s response to the sexual-assault report was prompt and equitable. Federal guidelines say colleges typically take 60 days to investigate cases, but that is not a requirement. Before all this happened, Cavalier said, she knew of Title IX only as a law that prohibited gender bias in college sports. Now, like a growing number of students, she has learned of its relevance to sexual violence. Cavalier wants to help spread the word, saying she is “totally up for being an activist.” She recently helped organize a Take Back the Night event on campus to promote prevention of sexual violence. She also is resolved to stay at Catholic and finish her degree. “I’m not going to allow something he did — and something that the administration maybe didn’t take care of correctly — I’m not going to let that take away from my college experience,” she said. “Because that’s not fair.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Erin Cavalier, a student at the Catholic University of America, recounts her struggles after reporting a sexual assault on campus in 2012, leading to a federal investigation into the university's handling of her case as part of the growing national debate on how colleges respond to allegations of sexual assault."},{"question":"This is a question with answer options.

After graduating from Michigan State University (from which, five decades later, he would receive an honorary doctorate), he became the pianist and arranger for the vocal group the Hi-Lo's in the late 1950s. Fischer went on to work with Donald Byrd and Dizzy Gillespie, and became known for his Latin and bossa nova recordings in the 1960s. He composed the Latin jazz standard \\"Morning\\", and the jazz standard \\"Pensativa\\". In 1975, after ten years of studiowork and artistically successful yet obscure solo records, Fischer found a new direction. Just like Hancock and Chick Corea he was a pioneer on the electric keyboard, and in that capacity he joined vibraphonist Cal Tjader's group. The reunion with Tjader gave a new impulse to Fischer's love of Latin-American music. He started his own group with Latino musicians, \\"Salsa Picante\\", which showed great eclecticism in musical styles. Later he expanded to include four vocalists billed separately as \\"2 + 2\\". The album 2+2 won a Grammy in 1981. After that he recorded And Sometimes Voices and Free Fall with the vocal group. Free Fall was nominated in three categories for the Grammy Awards and won under the category of \\"Best Jazz Album By A Vocal Duo Or Group\\". Crazy Bird was with the instrumental group and Alone Together, a solo piano album recorded on a Hamburg Steinway. It was recorded for Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer and the German company MPS Records. In the seventies, Fischer began doing orchestral sweeteners for R&B groups. His nephew, Andre Fischer, was the drummer of the band Rufus, featuring Chaka Khan. \\"Apparently the arrangements I made for their early records were appreciated, for in the following years I was hired almost exclusively by black artists.\\" Among the artists Fischer worked for are The Jacksons, Earl Klugh, Switch, Debarge, Shotgun (a late 70s offshoot of 24-Carat Black) and Atlantic Starr. His walls are now covered with gold and platinum records from these recordings, Grammy Award Nominations, and several NARAS MVP Awards, culminating in an MVP-emeritus in 1985. Once his fame as an arranger was established, Fischer also worked with pop musicians like Paul McCartney, Prince, Celine Dion and Robert Palmer. \\"I am surprised that my arrangements are now considered one of the prerequisites for a hit album. People feel that they make a song sound almost classical.\\" Classical concert artist Richard Stoltzman commissioned him in 1983 to write a symphonic work using Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn themes. The result, \\"The Duke, Swee'pea and Me\\", an eleven and a half minute orchestral work, was performed with a symphony orchestra and Stoltzman on clarinet all around the world.

To break down the sentiment, it's essential to analyze the key terms and the overall message they convey. 1. Emotionally Complex: The term \\"emotionally complex\\" indicates that the heroine has a multi-faceted emotional landscape, depicting her as a well-rounded and more human character. This complexity is likely to make her relatable to the audience, who can empathize with her emotions and experiences. Her emotional depth portrays her as someone who is not one-dimensional, which is generally seen as a positive attribute in characters. This term also alludes to an intricate storytelling approach where the heroine's emotional journey plays a significant role in the overall narrative. 2. Dramatically Satisfying: The word \\"dramatically\\" here refers to the genre of drama, and it acknowledges a level of effectiveness in the storytelling, possibly in terms of suspense, character development, and story arc. The term \\"satisfying\\" expresses a sense of fulfillment and gratification in experiencing the character's journey, implying that the character's challenges, growth, and outcomes were engaging and emotionally rewarding for the reader or viewer. When considering these two key terms together, the sentiment expressed is one of appreciation not only for the heroine's emotional depth and relatability but also for the quality of the storytelling surrounding her. As the character is described as \\"dramatically satisfying,\\" it suggests that her story resonates with the audience and evokes a sense of fulfillment or catharsis. In conclusion, the sentiment perception of the sentence \\"emotionally complex, dramatically satisfying heroine\\" leans towards positive, as it conveys the appreciation and admiration of a nuanced, deep, and engaging lead character. The qualities the sentence conveys indicate that the heroine is a well-developed character, making her journey and developments throughout the story captivating, fascinating, and emotionally gratifying for the audience."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"A great appppppp\\" Answer:","response":"★★★★"},{"question":"Overalllength3,500mm Generate a sentence using the above characters:","response":"Step 1: Identify the components in the given string - \\"Overalllength\\" is a word and \\"3,500mm\\" represents a measurement.

The tweet says, \\"@randz10 word. i miss joella's classes.\\" 1. Context: The tweet appears to be a message or comment directed at a user with the handle @randz10. The context indicates that the user is discussing someone named Joella and her classes. From this, we can infer that Joella could possibly be an instructor or teacher whose classes the user used to attend. 2. Positive or Negative Expressions: The key phrase here is \\"i miss.\\" This suggests that the user has fond memories of Joella's classes, as they currently miss attending them. This points towards a positive expression in the tweet. 3. Tone: The tone can be seen as casual, given the use of informal language and the phrase \\"word,\\" a colloquial term often used to affirm agreement or acknowledge understanding. There is a sense of nostalgia in the tweet since the user misses attending Joella's classes. Taking the context, positive expressions, and tone into consideration, the tweet's sentiment can be classified as positively nostalgic.

Brush Valley Township was formed in 1835 from Wheatfield Township and named after the valley of Brush Creek . Brush Valley Township was formed from Brush Creek in 1835 , and named for the valley of Wheatfield Township .","response":"No, the two sentences do not mean the same thing. Here's why: 1. Sentence analysis: a. The first sentence tells that Brush Valley Township was formed in 1835 from Wheatfield Township and was named after the valley of Brush Creek. This implies that Wheatfield Township was the original larger entity from which Brush Valley Township was carved out, and the name 'Brush Valley Township' was inspired by the geographical feature, the valley of Brush Creek. b. The second sentence states that Brush Valley Township was formed from Brush Creek in 1835, and named for the valley of Wheatfield Township. This implies that Brush Creek was the original entity from where Brush Valley Township was created. The name 'Brush Valley Township' in this case is stated to be named after the valley within Wheatfield Township, which does not intuitively make sense. 2. Logic: a. Historically townships are politically designated areas usually formed from larger administrative territories like counties or larger townships, not geographical features like rivers or creeks. Therefore, the formation of a township from a creek as mentioned in the second sentence is confusing and does not follow normal administrative practices. b. Naming a new township after a valley from the original larger township would be more probable, as suggested in the first sentence, rather than naming it after a valley in another, possibly unrelated, township, as suggested in the second sentence. In conclusion, the statements have different meanings because they suggest different origins for the township and different inspirations for its name."},{"question":"Is this product review positive?

Not the sales figures, the fame, the fortune, the fact that her name pops up on bestseller lists with the frequency of freakishly popular scribes such as Stephen King and Mary Higgins Clark. If you're inclined to trust what Jodi Picoult says -- and if you're not, then you're the kind of cynic who probably isn't interested in her or her books, anyway -- she is still, after 17 novels and 18 years on the job, just as humble, wide-eyed and hardworking as she was at the beginning of her career. \\"I can't believe anyone buys my books,\\" Picoult says from her home near Hanover, N.H. \\"I would've been happy just being published and having my mother buy a copy. I've been very fortunate. \\"It's still a little bit of a miracle.\\" Even miracles, though, need some muscle behind them. For Picoult, 43, the push comes from a rigorous writing schedule -- she's up at 5 each morning and, after a three-mile walk with a longtime pal, settles down in her home office to write until 3:30 p.m., when her three children barge in from school -- and an amazing ability to put her finger on hot-button social issues that her novels explore with honesty, authenticity and emotional power. Her trademark is the domestic drama, the story that puts ordinary people in the midst of contemporary crises: teen suicide, bullying, childhood sexual abuse, school violence. But in novels such as \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" (2004), a story about parents who conceive a child so that an older child, ill with leukemia, will have a match for blood marrow donation, and which was made into a 2009 movie starring Cameron Diaz, Picoult doesn't use the family-in-peril motif as a cheap gimmick. Her books are written with naturalness and flair. She knows how to tell a story, and how to fill it with intriguing, believable characters. Her latest novel, \\"House Rules,\\" published last week, is a whodunit with a twist. The young man accused of murder, Jacob Hunt, has Asperger's syndrome. It falls to his plucky mom, Emma; his brooding brother, Theo; and a bumbling young attorney named Oliver to go to bat for Jacob. Like many of Picoult's works, \\"House Rules\\" is told from multiple points of view and includes a great deal of information about its theme -- Asperger's -- but the facts are added gently, artfully, so that it never feels like a term paper. To research \\"House Rules,\\" she met with seven young people with Asperger's and corresponded with many more. \\"It was like cracking open their minds. This was an important part of making Jacob real.\\" Picoult, a native of Long Island, N.Y., is a graduate of Princeton University. That's where she met her husband, Tim van Leer. She began writing seriously in college and never stopped. \\"For me, books start with the voices of my characters,\\" she says. \\"I can hear them all so clearly.\\" And those topical themes? \\"I worry about these things myself. The things I write about are the things that keep me up at night. \\"You don't do this to be famous or to have money. If you're going to write, you do it for you. It's a compulsion. When I don't write, I get itchy. The stories are like something under my skin.\\" Keller is cultural critic at the Chicago Tribune. Summary:","response":"Best-selling author Jodi Picoult maintains a humble and hardworking attitude towards her success, adhering to a strict writing schedule. Her novels explore hot-button social issues, with her latest, \\"House Rules,\\" focusing on a murder suspect with Asperger's syndrome. To accurately portray the character, Picoult met with young people with Asperger's and incorporated their experiences into the narrative."},{"question":"Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A girl wears a fancy dress and a tiara.\\", is the sentence \\"A girl is in a dress and wears a crown.\\" a true sentence?

In the first sentence, it is a tiara, and in the second sentence, it is a crown. A tiara is like a small, fancy crown, so the second sentence is also true because it describes a similar situation."},{"question":"Write a sentence in English.","response":"I'm sorry, but the task seems to contradict the instruction to provide a detailed and long answer instead of just a single sentence. However, if the task does require a single sentence, here it is: \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\" Now, to elaborate and provide a longer, detailed answer, let's break down this sentence: \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\" is a commonly used pangram in the English language. A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. This particular sentence is often used to display fonts or to test keyboards because it includes all 26 letters of the English alphabet. The structure of the sentence is quite simple, following a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) format which is common in English: 1. The subject is \\"The quick brown fox\\" which does the action. 2. The verb \\"jumps over\\" describes the action performed by the subject. 3. The object \\"the lazy dog\\" is who or what the action is performed on. In relation to grammar, it's worth noting the use of definite articles 'the' which specifies or identifies what we are talking about (in this case, the fox and the dog). The adjectives 'quick', 'brown', and 'lazy', are used in this sentence to describe respective nouns, illustrating the use of adjectives in English phrases. The sentence also declaratively demonstrates a basic use of English tenses - it uses the simple present tense, which typically refers to actions which are habitual or generally true. So, in addition to being a simple sentence on the surface, \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\" serves vital linguistic, typographic and learning purposes in the English language."},{"question":"A tight supply of lamps for front projectors and rear-projection TVs (RPTVs) is likely to persist through 2005 as Taiwan-based projector makers are increasing their shipments of RPTV optical engines, said lamp makers Ushio, Royal Philips Electronics and Choose your answer.

Nate used pesticides, while his buddy Don used bacterium that produces a toxin instead. Don was happy with the results. But I can use this background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. What is an answer for this question: Which farmer didn't use a an insecticidal spray that is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active? Answer:","response":"The farmer who did not use an insecticidal spray that is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active is Nate. Justifying my answer, from the given situation, it was stated that Nate used pesticides. It was not specified that Nate used an inactive, digestible form of pest control like the Bt toxin. Also, considering the background information provided, the Bt toxin needs to be ingested by pests to be activated. Don used this bacterium for pest control and experienced satisfactory results. Therefore, Nate is the one who didn't use the insecticidal spray that needs digestion by an insect to become active in this situation."},{"question":"Q: Classify the given a piece of financial news into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.

Yesterday (March 16), the company announced the suspension of data analytics company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its prominent parent political firm Cambridge Analytica—three years after it illegally used the data of up to 50 million users. According to a note shared by the company, in 2015 Facebook found out that, despite telling its users otherwise, Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan passed user data collected through personality testing app “thisisyourdigitallife” (which touted itself as a personality test used by psychologists) to the political firm Cambridge Analytica—a company owned by Robert Mercer and led by Steve Bannon at the time—and to Christopher Wylie, from a digital service company called Eunoia Technologies. The 270,000 people who downloaded the app allowed it access not only to their data, but some of their friends’—depending on their settings. However, they did not authorize that their data be shared with other companies, a behavior that is in violation of Facebook platform policies. The revelation comes from reporting by The Observer. According to Wylie, a whistleblower who detailed the illegal data use, saying the information was used in 2014 to profile individual US voters who were then served Donald Trump ads during the election. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” Wylie told The Observer, “That was the basis that the entire company was built on.” After finding out that the breach had happened, Facebook deleted the app, then requested a certification from all involved that the obtained data had been destroyed—but Facebook never followed up on it. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back,” Wylie said. Only last month, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO and Facebook both told the British parliament the political firm did not harvest any of the social media user data to target election ads during Brexit. The firm continues to deny the allegations: Facebook has repeatedly denied that data breaches as the one detailed occurred—and even after finding out, years after the fact, that it had, the company defends its best practices. ”We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook states in the same note that admits their “vigorous enforcement” consisted in taking the word of someone who had already broken their regulation to ensure said information was protected. Further, the note tries to put the responsibility of controlling such information on the user, but highlighting a the “ways we give people the tools to control their experience.” ||||| Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. “This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.” In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. ||||| The algorithm used in the Facebook data breach trawled though personal data for information on sexual orientation, race, gender – and even intelligence and childhood trauma The algorithm at the heart of the Facebook data breach sounds almost too dystopian to be real. It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma. A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds. Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window. Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach Read more But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments. When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality. These were just some of the unexpected but consistent correlations noted in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in 2013. “Few users were associated with ‘likes’ explicitly revealing their attributes. For example, less than 5% of users labelled as gay were connected with explicitly gay groups, such as No H8 Campaign,” the peer-reviewed research found. The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default. “The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said. “Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.” To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work. Quick guide How the story unfolded Show Hide In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well. The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable. Aleksandr Kogan To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters. It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use. And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred. It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another. The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.” The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed. Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”. Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties. |||||","response":"Facebook is facing allegations that it was involved in the illegal harvesting of data from around 50 million users by data analytics firm Strategic Communication Laboratories and its parent political firm, Cambridge Analytica. The claim comes from whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Researcher Aleksandr Kogan created an app that subsequently passed user data to Cambridge Analytica, a company that was then led by Trump ally Steve Bannon. The data was reportedly used to profile individuals for targeted ads during the 2016 election. Facebook learned about the breach in 2015, but has been accused of failing to check that the data had been destroyed. The company denies it committed a data breach and has suspended both firms."},{"question":"New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. Question: \\"What did Hughes do to show his style and his dramatic side?\\" Answer: \\"Established the Hilton Hotel\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"No, the answer is incorrect. To show his style and dramatic side, Howard Hughes promptly bought the Desert Inn property and fired the management when he was asked to vacate his penthouse room to make way for high rollers.

Movie title: Let the Right One In Movie plot: Twelve year old Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is so wimpy that he's constantly picked on by the other boys at his school, especially Conny (Patrik Rydmark) and his two friends, Martin (Mikael Erhardsson) and Andreas (Johan Sömnes). Out of fear, Oskar never fights back. In the evenings, however, he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors. One evening, Oskar notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into #15, the apartment next door to his. Oddly, the first thing they do is to cover the windows with cardboard. What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood. Consequently, Eli is beginning to get hungry.One evening, as Oskar is in the courtyard stabbing a tree in lieu of his tormentors, he notices Eli watching him. She's not very friendly, as she tells him right off that she can't be friends with him. The next evening, they run into each other again in the courtyard. Oskar notices that Eli is not wearing a coat even though it's the dead of winter in Stockholm. What's more, she's not even cold. And she smells bad. Still, Oskar shares with her his Rubik's cube and shows her how to work it. After Oskar has gone inside, Eli goes hunting. She waits in the shadows under a bridge. When two neighborhood friends, Jocke (Mikael Rahm) and Lacke (Peter Carlberg), part company, and Jocko walks under the bridge, Eli calls out, \\"Help me!\\" Thinking that the little girl has fallen, Jocko picks her up. Suddenly, Eli latches onto him and bites his neck. Gösta (Karl-Robert... A:","response":"During an ice-skating field trip at the lake, Oskar's fellow students find the body of Jocke (Mikael Rahm). Jocke is one of the neighborhood friends who falls victim to Eli the vampire. Eli attacks Jocke while he is walking under a bridge after leaving his friend Lacke (Peter Carlberg). Eli pretends to need help to lure Jocke into picking her up, and then she latches onto him and bites his neck. Gösta (Karl-Robert Lindgren), another local, witnesses the attack but doesn't intervene, as he is too afraid. The discovery of Jocke's body serves as a significant and tense plot point in the movie \\"Let the Right One In,\\" as it provides a visual representation of the danger and horror surrounding Eli's true nature as a vampire. This event further highlights the internal and moral struggle that Oskar faces as he grows closer to Eli and begins to understand her true identity. Despite being a vampire, Eli comes across as a compelling character, creating a sense of ambiguity around whether investing in her companionship is a wise decision for Oskar. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, you should consider the movie's unique approach to the vampire genre, focusing on character development and the emotional journey of a young, bullied boy finding solace and strength through his growing friendship with a supernatural being. Additionally, it's essential to evaluate the appeal of the plot, the depth of characters, and the overall market interest in both the vampire genre and coming-of-age stories."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Encrytpion does not work.

Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation. Believe me that when you let yourself eat cheesecake, chocolate and hot chips, the novelty soon wears off. I mostly eat unprocessed food, not because it’s “good” but because I love the taste and prefer how it makes me feel. YOU CAN STILL EAT DIET FOOD Low fat ice-cream, Diet Coke and protein powder are still in my diet but I eat them because I prefer the taste over their ‘real’ counterparts.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"The first and second sentences represent two different perspectives on the reasons people want to come to the United States, and they cannot be considered as completely true or false on their own. However, it is possible to examine and discuss the relationships between these perspectives and the reality. Sentence 1: \\"But do you think that's why there's so many people that want to come to the United States because of freedom?\\" This sentence suggests that one of the factors driving people to immigrate to the United States is the perception of personal freedom available in the country. The idea of freedom is often associated with several aspects, such as freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and economic freedom. To some extent, it is true that many people are attracted to the United States because of the opportunities and liberties available. To understand whether these perceptions are grounded in reality, it is essential to examine the context of those seeking to come to the United States. For instance, people coming from countries with oppressive regimes or economic difficulties might view the United States as a land of greater freedom and opportunity. Sentence 2: \\"The United States is anything but freedom, people want to come because of the strict laws.\\" This sentence seems to negate the idea of the United States as a symbol of freedom and implies that people immigrate due to the existence of strict laws. It could be inferred that the strict laws offer a level of order and stability to the country, which attracts immigrants. One could argue that the United States is not a perfect representation of freedom, as the country's history includes instances where rights have been eroded. Additionally, some of the strict laws in the United States might affect certain social groups disproportionately, leading to social inequalities. However, the statement overlooks the counterargument that many people do indeed come to the United States in search of freedom and better opportunities. In conclusion, neither sentence can be claimed as entirely true or false. Both perspectives have elements of truth, and it is crucial to recognize that people's motivations for immigrating to the United States can vary widely and encompass many factors, including both freedom and the presence of strict laws. Therefore, one cannot determine the truthfulness of one sentence based on the other, as each presents a different viewpoint on the subject."},{"question":"Translate to Romanian: Last month, the threat of a Russian veto forced the West to shelve the latest draft of a UN Security Council resolution based on Ahtisaari's plan.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What did the author say about the Australian sun?

Sentence 1: \\"okay i'm a meat and potato man yeah\\" This sentence suggests that the speaker is affirming their preference for meat and potatoes. The casual tone and informal language imply a strong affinity for this type of food. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the speaker \\"prefers\\" meat and potatoes, as it mainly portrays their identity as a \\"meat and potato man.\\" Sentence 2: \\"I prefer meat and potatoes.\\" In this sentence, the speaker clearly states their preference for meat and potatoes. This declaration is more explicit, as the term \\"prefer\\" implies a conscious choice or a deliberate ranking of options in favor of meat and potatoes. Considering the information in both sentences, it can be determined whether or not the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. (A) Yes - The second sentence can be seen as being entailed by the first, in the sense that both sentences convey the idea that the speaker has a strong affinity for meat and potatoes. While the first sentence is less explicit, the informal tone and the use of \\"meat and potato man\\" indicate that the speaker indeed has a preference for meat and potatoes. Therefore, the sentiments expressed in both sentences are consistent. (B) It is not possible to tell - This option can be discarded because it is clear from both sentences that the speaker expresses a liking for meat and potatoes. (C) No - This option can be rejected as well, since the first sentence implies a preference without explicitly stating it, and the second sentence confirms this preference directly. In conclusion, given the context and the sentiments expressed in both sentences, the correct answer is (A) Yes.

It means that the Department has been legally mandated to issue those interim regulations within the specified 30-day period. Thus, the Department has a clear obligation to comply with the given direction and ensure that the interim regulations are issued efficiently and within the prescribed time frame. Failure to do so may lead to legal consequences or undermine the effectiveness of the regulations. In summary, the hypothesis stating that \\"Interim regulations needed to be issued by the Department within 30 days\\" is true based on the given premise. The department is required to issue those interim regulations within 30 days of the date of enactment, as directed by L. 104134."},{"question":"The IMF, which reviews the performance of the republics separately, has already carried out a similar mission in Serbia.

Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

Article: John had been on a business trip for three weeks. It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \\"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . \\"No, I have to have roses,\\" he said, \\"My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite.\\" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, \\"Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars.\\" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, \\"Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her.\\" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally.

Netanyahu accepted House Speaker John Boehner’s invitation to address a joint session of Congress on March 3, in a move that wasn’t coordinated with President Barack Obama’s administration. Critics say the measure is meant to undercut Obama’s efforts to negotiate a deal with the Iranians and will hurt Israel by damaging ties with the White House. They also say the speech will give the prime minister an unfair boost before Israel’s March 17 elections. “This is a poke in the eye” of the Obama administration, “and ultimately a blow to Israel,” said lawmaker Shelly Yachimovich of the opposition Labor party. “In exchange for giving a campaign speech, Netanyahu is prepared to hurt our relationship with the U.S.,” Yachimovich said today on Israel Radio. Republicans and some Democrats in Congress seek new economic and diplomatic sanctions on the government in Tehran, a move that could kill any nuclear deal. Obama said in his State of the Union address that he would veto any proposed legislation that increases sanctions. Netanyahu backs tougher penalties. Sanctions were imposed to deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons technology. Iran says its nuclear program is designed only for energy and medical uses, and other Middle Eastern nations say Israel harbors the region’s only atomic arsenal. Israel neither confirms nor denies possessing atomic weapons. Netanyahu’s former ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, called on him to cancel his Congressional address. “His behavior over the last few days created the impression that this is a cynical political move, and it could hurt our attempts to act against Iran,” said Oren, now campaigning for parliament on the list of the newly formed Kulanu party, in an interview Saturday on Channel 2 television. Ties between Netanyahu and Obama have historically been strained over issues including peacemaking with the Palestinians and how to contain Iran’s nuclear program. Obama won’t meet Netanyahu when he comes to Washington to deliver his speech because it’s too close to the Israeli elections, the White House said.

Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\\"Young France\\"). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected Jean Cocteau's 1918 Le coq et l'arlequin in favour of a \\"living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness\\".

Illinois police departments from Naperville to Peoria are offering their lobbies as \\"safe havens\\" for completing online transactions, joining a national trend. Naperville police Cmdr. Ken Parcel said Monday that the department plans to announce that the lobby of its station can be used by buyers and sellers who connect through Craigslist and other online markets. Most Internet-related crime in the western suburb involves impersonal scams, not in-person transactions, Parcel said, who described the lobby policy as \\"a preventative measure to ensure there's a safe place to allow (buyers and sellers) to conduct their normal lives and business.\\" The department's staff won't be involved in the transactions or oversee them, Parcel said. Late last month, the Peoria Police Department announced that residents could use a department parking lot and the lobby of its station for online transactions, \\"in an effort to deter Craigslist robberies.\\" The Chicago Police Department said in a statement Monday that there are no dedicated \\"safe zones\\" for Craigslist buyers and sellers in the city, but it echoed Naperville's desire to keep transactions safe. \\"If you plan on buying or selling items via Craigslist or any other online site, the Chicago Police Department suggests that you conduct your transaction at the closest police station to protect both the buyer and seller,\\" the statement said. The statement did not specify which areas in or around Chicago police stations would be open for online buyers and sellers to complete their deals. The department recommended that such transactions take place in well-lit, public places and, if possible, that those involved \\"bring another person with you.\\" Reports of violent crime and theft stemming from Craigslist transactions occasionally appear on police blotters in the city and suburbs. In one instance, a dispute over a Craigslist transaction for an online gaming system in 2013 led to the shooting death of a 24-year-old Tinley Park man. But such crimes are rare, according to the Chicago Police Department. Police in Illinois said crime didn't drive the forming of safe havens, though one Indiana official said it was the impetus. Dax Norton, town manager in Whitestown, said a number of violent crimes linked to Craigslist transactions in Indiana were the \\"straw that broke the camel's back.\\" He said the town recently decided to offer its municipal complex. Residents can even request a police officer to look over the transaction, Norton said. \\"My wife uses Craigslist a lot,\\" Norton said. \\"I think it's a great idea.\\" Since Whitestown announced the service last month, police have overseen various transactions, including one involving a puppy otherwise destined for a local animal shelter, Norton said. Not all police departments are jumping on board to oversee Craigslist transactions. Edgar Gregory, deputy chief of the Joliet Police Department, said there are other locations available for safe transactions. He suggested residents use public lots, even the police station's, but said the department doesn't oversee sales transactions. No one from Craigslist could be reached for comment. But Craigslist features a personal safety page suggesting users meet in a public place, tell a family member where they are going and take a cellphone. The page notes that the \\"overwhelming majority of Craigslist users are trustworthy and well-intentioned,\\" and that violent crime is low. Even so, the movement to make such transactions safer is gathering steam nationwide. In Hartford, Conn., there's \\"Operation Safe Lot,\\" in which online deals can be completed in a police parking lot. In Virginia Beach, Va., a program called \\"Find a Safe Place\\" allows such transactions in police station lobbies. Lombard resident Kay Pauli said he always meets his Craigslist buyers in a public place, like a mall or a gas station. Right now, Pauli is focused on selling a Budweiser neon sign. Pauli, who said he likes the idea of meeting at a police department or public building, said he's heard stories of Craigslist crimes but hasn't had any problems with safety in the years he's sold items through the site. \\"We usually meet at a public place,\\" he said. \\"It's an easy way for people to find me, too. Like a JCPenney or something.\\" cgross@tribpub.com Twitter @lexygross ||||| A Montgomery County community is setting up one of the nation's first Craigslist Transaction Safe Zones. Conshohocken Police want to make sure people doing business on the popular website do it safely. FOX 29's Dave Schratwieser shows us how it works. The Conshohocken Police Station Parking Lot on Fayette Street couldn't be any safer. There are police cars, surveillance cameras, good lighting even an emergency phone to contact police. So now the chief has designated the parking lot and the lobby at police headquarters as an online safe transaction zone. He says if you're conducting a one on one transaction where money is changing hands. This is the safest place to do it. The new safe transaction zone comes as rip offs are increasing. Two weeks ago 34-year old Dion Jordan met a guy who wanted to purchase a dodge charger like this at a local Wawa. During a second pre-arranged meeting at an airport hotel, they went for a test drive. That's when police say Jordan and an accomplice kidnapped the buyer and robbed him of 2,000 at gunpoint. Jordan has now been charged in the car deal gone bad and the murder of 49 year old Dallas Long two days earlier. He faces charges in several bank robberies where he wore this expensive Hollywood style disguise. Investigators are now trying to link him to five other murders. The chief says never go to a transaction alone and always use cash or a bank check. Do the transaction during daytime hours when financial institutions are open in case a problem develops with the deal. He believes other towns will follow suit with safety zones of their own. ||||| Summary:","response":"Police departments in Illinois are offering their stations as safe places for people to meet and finish the deals they made on websites like Craigslist.

Mention you looked at a reputable pricing guide. Negotiate until you reach the right deal. Close the sale.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Mastering the Art of Negotiation: A Comprehensive Guide to Closing Deals Successfully Introduction Negotiations are an essential part of our daily lives, especially in the realm of commerce. Whether you are a buyer or a seller, it is crucial to be aware of the strategies and tactics necessary to close a successful deal. This article explores a simple, yet effective approach to achieving this goal: allowing the seller to name the first price, referring to a reputable pricing guide, engaging in the negotiation process until a suitable deal is reached, and ultimately, closing the sale. Each of these steps will be examined in detail to provide a reliable framework for any negotiation scenario. Step 1: Have the Seller Name the First Price The opening offer is a critical aspect of any negotiation, as it sets the tone and provides a reference point for the rest of the discussion. It is generally advantageous to have the seller present the first price, as it allows the buyer to assess the seller's position and price expectation. This initial offer can also serve as an anchor that guides the rest of the negotiation, and it is important to bear in mind that the seller may intentionally make a high opening offer with the expectation that the final price will likely be negotiated downwards. Step 2: Mention You Looked at a Reputable Pricing Guide Once the seller has named the first price, it is essential for the buyer to demonstrate knowledge of the product or service's current market value. Referring to a reputable pricing guide or online platform where prices are regularly updated can provide valuable data to support the buyer's negotiation strategy. For example, resources like Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds can offer insights into the fair market value of a used car, while websites like Zillow and Redfin can help assess the true value of a property. Mentioning the use of a pricing guide can also foster trust and credibility in the negotiation process. It signals to the seller that the buyer is informed and has invested time in researching prior to the negotiation. As a result, the seller is more likely to take the buyer's counteroffers seriously, leading to a more productive and amicable negotiation process. Step 3: Negotiate Until You Reach the Right Deal The core of any negotiation lies in the exchange of proposals and counteroffers. To reach a satisfactory agreement, both parties must be willing to compromise and find common ground. It is crucial for the buyer to remain firm but flexible in their demands, focusing on their ultimate goal and staying open to alternative options. When negotiating, buyers should consider the following tactics: 1. Highlight the benefits of the offer for the seller: Emphasizing how the deal can benefit the seller in terms of quick payment, lower transaction costs, or fewer risks can increase the appeal of the buyer's proposal. 2. Utilize silence as a tool: By pausing after the seller's counteroffer, the buyer can create an ambiance of contemplation and tactfully prompt the seller to ponder over the proposal, possibly resulting in an improved offer. 3. Be willing to walk away: Demonstrating that the buyer is ready to walk away from a deal that does not fit their expectations can exert pressure on the seller to be more flexible and amenable during the negotiation process. Step 4: Close the Sale Once an agreement has been reached, it is essential to formally close the sale. Both parties should review and confirm the deal's details, including the agreed-upon price, payment terms, and any additional agreements. The buyer and seller may sign a contract or purchase agreement to seal the deal and protect their respective interests. Finally, arrangements for payment, delivery, or transfer of ownership should be made to ensure a smooth and hassle-free transaction. Conclusion In conclusion, mastering the art of negotiation involves being well-prepared, informed, and patient. By following the steps outlined in this article—having the seller name the first price, mentioning a reputable pricing guide, negotiating effectively, and closing the sale—a buyer can greatly increase the likelihood of securing a successful deal. Moreover, adopting these strategies in the negotiation process can lead to stronger relationships, mutual understanding, and lasting satisfaction for both parties."},{"question":"Choose your answer from: (a). so they wouldn't be in the doorway (b). see the boxes (c). so they wouldn't be stolen Q: I heard that The boxes were in the doorway, so Alex moved the boxes from the doorway.

Per Variety, the company has acquired the rights to Casting JonBenet, a documentary by Kitty Green set to debut at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah later this month. After its premiere in Park City, the film—which Netflix says will be its first nonfiction flick to make a Sundance showing—will air on Netflix and in some theaters nationwide in the spring. The filmmakers plumbed the community of Boulder, Colo., where the Ramsey family lived when JonBenet was killed, documenting locals looking back on the unsolved crime and analyzing its effect on families there. \\"Netflix is the ideal home for showcasing Kitty’s sharply rendered vision of a mythic American tragedy to a global audience,\\" a Netflix programming exec says. Rolling Stone and the Hollywood Reporter note the film joins a glut of recent JonBenet coverage, including Lifetime's Who Killed JonBenet?, A&E's The Killing of JonBenet: The Truth Uncovered, and CBS' The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey, which spurred a lawsuit from JonBenet's brother, Burke (the special theorized Burke may have accidentally killed her). Wondering if Netflix's cinematic coup is an attempt to cash in on the obsession with true-crime hits like the Serial podcast and Netflix's own Making a Murderer? Megan Reynolds doesn't think so. \\"The Ramsey case has consumed the national imagination for the twenty years it's gone unsolved,\\" she writes for Jezebel. \\"It feels crass to say that a new take on the case is refreshing, but examining the impact of the case through this lens is a perspective that we have yet to see.\\" (New DNA tests are in the works in JonBenet's case.)","response":"Hey there!

This shift is driven by the pressing need to combat climate change, decrease reliance on fossil fuels, and diversify energy supply for increased security and resilience. One of the major players in renewable energy development is solar power. Solar power systems use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. Among the various solar power technologies, photovoltaic (PV) solar panels and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems are the most widely used. While both systems harness solar energy, they differ in methodology, efficiency, and deployment. Although both types of solar power systems are proven to be effective in generating electricity, researchers and scientists continue to look for ways to improve the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of solar power. One emerging technology in this field is solar panel coatings, which are designed to increase the amount of sunlight captured by solar panels and minimize their energy loss.

Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

Agatha Answer:","response":"Title: Dreams of Deception Step 1: Introduce the characters and setting Our story is set in a small, quiet town, where Walter, a middle-aged high school teacher, leads a seemingly ordinary life. Agatha is a charming and enigmatic new neighbor who moves in next door. Step 2: Establish the main conflict Walter begins to have increasingly disturbing, vivid dreams of murdering Agatha. Initially, he dismisses these dreams as mere nightmares, but as they become more frequent and intense, he starts to question his own sanity and motives. Step 3: Deepen the character relationships As Walter battles the darkness within himself, he can't help but be drawn to Agatha. He befriends her in hopes of finding an explanation for his murderous dreams. As they grow closer, a connection forms between them. Agatha has her own secrets she conceals from the world, which creates an air of intrigue around her. Step 4: Introduce a plot twist Walter attends a town event where he stumbles upon an old newspaper article about Agatha's father, a former prominent townsman, who also suffered from an eerily similar sequence of dreams before he mysteriously disappeared. Step 5: The dreams intensify Haunted by the realization that Agatha's father went mad and vanished under similar circumstances, Walter's dreams become even more violent and frequent.

Hypothesis: You can visit Griffith Park for the water, but they don't have trails. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Options are: [a]. yes [b]. it is not possible to tell [c]. no","response":"[c]. no The premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, the premise and the hypothesis are contradictory. The premise clearly states that Griffith Park offers miles of trails for various activities such as cycling, jogging, and horseback riding. This information directly contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that Griffith Park does not have trails. The premise showcases Griffith Park as an ideal location for nature enthusiasts and individuals looking for recreational opportunities. The park's extensive trail system allows visitors to engage in numerous outdoor activities, providing them with a closer spot to immerse themselves in nature. Exploring the trails enables park-goers to get some exercise while taking in the beautiful surroundings and panoramic views the park has to offer. Additionally, Griffith Park is well-known for its diverse range of attractions, such as the Griffith Observatory, the Greek Theatre, and the Los Angeles Zoo, further enhancing its appeal to outdoor enthusiasts and families alike. These attractions make Griffith Park an ideal location for a day out, offering both educational activities and a chance to enjoy nature. On the other hand, the hypothesis incorrectly assumes that Griffith Park only offers water-based activities. Although the park may also have water features, such as fountains or ponds, these are not the main attractions or the only activities available within the park, as evidenced by the premise. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Griffith Park clearly offers an extensive range of trails for visitors to explore, as outlined in the premise.

This is unfortunate because it degrades a worthwhile literary endeavor. Instead, the basic interest of science fiction lies in the relation between man and his technology and between man and the universe. Science fiction is a literature of change and a literature of the future, and the aspects of human life that it considers make it well worth reading and studying for no other literary form does quite the same things. What is science fiction? To begin, the following definition should be helpful: science fiction is a literary subgenre which postulates(...) a change (for human beings) from conditions as we know them and follows the implications of these changes to a conclusion. The first point that science fiction is a literary subgenre is a very important one, but one which is often overlooked. Specifically, science fiction is either a short story or a novel. There are only a few dramas which could be called science fiction; the body of poetry that might be labeled science fiction is only slightly larger. To say that science fiction is a subgenre of prose fiction is to say that it has all the basic characteristics and serves the same basic functions in much the same way as prose fiction in general, that is, it shares a great deal with all other novels and short stories. Everything that can be said about prose fiction, in general, applies to science fiction. Every piece of science fiction, whether short story or novel, must have a narrator, a story, a plot, characters, setting, and language. The themes of science fiction are concerned with interpreting man's nature and experience around him. Themes in science fiction are constructed and presented in exactly the same ways that themes are dealt with in any other kind of fiction. They are the result to a particular combination of a narrator, story, plot, character, setting, and language. In short, the reasons for reading...

The date set for the executions of the three Quaker evangelists , Mary Dyer , Marmaduke Stephenson and William Robinson , was 27 October 1659 .","response":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences essentially convey the same information but in a slightly different way. Paraphrasing involves rephrasing a sentence without changing its meaning, oftentimes altering sentence structure, word order, or using synonyms for some words. Here's a detailed breakdown of the two sentences to better illustrate the paraphrasing: 1. Original sentence: \\"The date for the executions of the three Quakers - Evangelists , Mary Dyer , Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson - was set on 27 October 1659.\\" 2. Paraphrased sentence: \\"The date set for the executions of the three Quaker evangelists, Mary Dyer, Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson, was 27 October 1659.\\" While the overall meaning of the sentences is the same, let's analyze the paraphrased elements in the second sentence: - The phrase \\"The date for the executions\\" is changed to \\"The date set for the executions\\" – a slight variation in the structure while preserving the meaning. - The order of the words \\"three Quakers - Evangelists\\" is altered to \\"three Quaker evangelists\\" – making it more concise and easier to understand. - The position of \\"Mary Dyer, Marmaduke Stephenson, and William Robinson\\" remains the same in both sentences. - The phrase \\"was set on 27 October 1659\\" has been altered to \\"was 27 October 1659,\\" which simplifies the sentence by removing the preposition \\"on.\\" In conclusion, the paraphrased sentence effectively communicates the same message as the original sentence, with minor adjustments made to the structure and phrasing. Paraphrasing is a useful tool in writing and communication, as it allows for the presentation of information in varied ways to avoid redundancy and maintain the reader's interest."},{"question":"Question: who played billy in the year of living dangerously??

Week three marked the 26th game between Chicago and Dallas, the latter leading the series 14-11 entering the game. While the Bears won the last game in Dallas 34-18 (in 2012), the Cowboys won the most recent game 41-28 (in 2014). Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears offense should attack the Cowboys with their run game; the latter had allowed 4.8 yards per carry in the first two games. Additionally, the offense was without Jay Cutler after his injury sustained in week two, meaning Brian Hoyer started against Dallas, though Alshon Jeffery, who was battling knee injuries during the week, made his return for week three. The defense, also depleted by injuries with players like Danny Trevathan and Eddie Goldman ruled out for the game, had to be able to successfully tackle Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant and tight end Jason Witten while also applying pressure on rookie quarterback Dak Prescott. Joniak also wrote the Bears needed to excel on both sides in the red zone; against the Eagles, the Bears defense had a 50 percent touchdown efficiency in the red zone, made some big plays in the red zone in the loss to the Eagles, with a 50 percent touchdown efficiency rating on six attempts. Meanwhile, against the Washington Redskins, the Cowboys restricted them to just two field goals in the red zone, including a late interception by Barry Church. The Bears fell behind early when Prescott scored on a quarterback sneak during the opening drive. The Bears' next two drives ended with punts, while the Cowboys' resulting drives concluded with scores: Dan Bailey kicked a 49-yard field goal and Lance Dunbar scored on a one-yard run. Down 17-0, Chicago would score their first points of the game via Connor Barth's 34-yard field goal in the second quarter. On the following kickoff, Barth attempted an onside kick that Sherrick McManis successfully recovered, but Jonathan Anderson was ruled offsides, nullifying the play. Instead of retrying the onside, Barth simply kicked off. Dallas scored on the next drive with Alfred Morris' three-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted to start the second half, they regained possession when Terrance Williams was stripped by Jacoby Glenn and Adrian Amos recovered the ball. The takeaway resulted in the first touchdown of the game for the Bears when Hoyer threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller. Though the Cowboys punted on their next drive, Cameron Meredith was stripped by J. J. Wilcox and Tyrone Crawford recovered the fumble. However, they were unable to score when Bailey missed a 47-yard field goal wide left. In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys extended the lead when Bryant scored on a 17-yard touchdown catch. Hoyer responded when he threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Miller to make the score 31-14, but he lost a fumble when he was strip-sacked by Benson Mayowa on the Bears' next series, while the offense was unable to score on their final possession. Who missed a field goal in the third quarter?","response":"Dan Bailey missed a field goal in the third quarter."},{"question":"Diese Verpflichtung entfällt in dem Umfang, in welchem Sie die Drittnutzung nicht zu vertreten haben.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

Sentence 2: The six preliminary approvals from local offices are enough to enact the plan. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we need to analyze both sentences and understand their relationship. Sentence 1: \\"To date, six of the seven local offices have given the plan a preliminary thumbs-up.\\" This sentence provides us with the information that there are seven local offices, and six of them have already provided preliminary approval or support for the plan being discussed. It indicates that things are looking favorable for the plan but doesn't explicitly mention if this approval is sufficient for the plan to be enacted. Sentence 2: \\"The six preliminary approvals from local offices are enough to enact the plan.\\" This sentence claims that the six approvals obtained from the local offices are sufficient for the plan to proceed. It assumes that there is no need for all seven offices to approve the plan in order for it to be enacted. Now, let's examine whether Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. Entailment, in this context, means that if the facts in Sentence 1 are true, then Sentence 2 must also be true. In other words, if six out of seven local offices have provided preliminary approval, is it necessarily true that this is adequate for enacting the plan? It is not possible to infer from Sentence 1 alone that the approval from six local offices is enough to enact the plan. There is no explicit information given about the required number of approvals or the process to enact the plan. It could be the case that only a simple majority is needed, or perhaps unanimous approval from all seven offices is required, but this information is not provided in Sentence 1. Therefore, Sentence 2 is not entailed by Sentence 1. Although they are related in context and share information about the approvals from local offices, Sentence 1 doesn't provide enough information to conclude that the six obtained approvals are sufficient for plan enactment."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Insurance costs 50 of the initial bet","response":"Insurance costs 50% of the initial bet."},{"question":"The sender of an original message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the encrypted information only with intended recipients , thereby preventing unwanted persons from doing the same thing .

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"Step 1: Analyze the sentences for key elements. Original sentence: Key elements - sender, original message, decoding technique, encrypted information, intended recipients, preventing unwanted persons Paraphrase sentence: Key elements - originator, encrypted message, decoding technique, original information, intended recipients, precluding unwanted persons Step 2: Check if the key elements have equivalent meanings in both sentences. Equivalences: - sender = originator - original message = encrypted message - decoding technique = decoding technique - encrypted information = original information - intended recipients = intended recipients - preventing unwanted persons = precluding unwanted persons Step 3: Determine if the overall meanings of the two sentences are the same. In both sentences, the person who created the message (sender/originator) shares the decoding technique only with the intended recipients.

Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"When you're in a reception area, the most common scenario is that you are waiting for someone or something alongside other people who are also there for a similar purpose. The reception area could be inside a building or a facility, such as a motel, hospital, or hotel. Let's analyze each option step-by-step: 1. Motel: A motel is a type of accommodation primarily designed for travelers. Although a reception area could be found inside a motel, you do not wait alongside a motel itself, but there could be people waiting there with you. 2. Chair: A chair could be present in a reception area for people to sit on while they wait. Though you may wait alongside chairs, that is not the main focus of the waiting process. 3. Hospital: A hospital is a large medical facility where people might wait in a reception area for various reasons, such as doctor appointments, visiting patients, or getting test results. Similar to a motel, you do not wait alongside a hospital itself, but there could be people waiting there with you. 4. People: When you are waiting in a reception area, you may be surrounded by other people who are also waiting for various reasons. This option makes the most sense, as you are waiting alongside other people who could be there for similar purposes. 5. Hotels: A hotel is an establishment that provides accommodation for guests. Just like a motel and hospital, you don't wait alongside a hotel, but you might wait in a reception area inside the hotel among other people.

This implies that the two teams are playing against each other in a sports context. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that the white team is against the black. It's important to note that the term \\"against\\" could have multiple meanings: 1. In a competitive sense, meaning that they are opponents in the game. 2. In a more negative, antagonistic sense, suggesting a conflict or rivalry outside of the game. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Considering the two potential meanings of \\"against\\" from the hypothesis, we can determine which meaning is supported by the premise. Meaning 1: The premise supports this interpretation, as the hockey game is a competition between the white team and the black team. Meaning 2: Nothing in the premise suggests that the white team is against the black team in a negative, antagonistic sense. The premise only states that the two teams are playing against each other in a hockey game.

Quartermain and McNabb are leading a European businessman on a Safari to hunt elephants. Quartermain seems reluctant to kill all the elephants, but the businessman insists, and McNabb has Quartermain tied up. The adult elephant is wounded but escapes, and Quartermain warns the businessman that it will now come after him. Later that night, the businessman is killed by the elephant, which then destroys the camp. Quartermain then goes to London to rejoin his son, but is told by the boy's grandparents that they are filing for custody as they believe that Quartermain is an unfit father. Quartermain is told by his lawyer that they will probably win. He leaves and goes to the bar. While there, he is approached by Elizabeth Maitland and Captain Good to find her father. He refuses, not knowing who she is, and she leaves her father's card on the bar. On the way home, Captain Good stops to talk to an old friend and Elizabeth continues on. She is attacked, but the attackers are fought off by Quartermain, who came after reading her father's card and realising who she was. When they get back to the hotel, they find her room has been ransacked. She reveals her father had sent her a map to King Solomon's Mines, and, despite Quartermain's scepticism about the map's authenticity, they leave for Africa. In Africa, they join Sir Henry, one of Quartermain's old friends, and, along with some of Quartermain's African friends, they set out to find Sam.","response":"What event or sequence of events led Allan Quatermain to accept Elizabeth Maitland's request to help find her father, Sam Maitland, setting them off to Africa in search of him and the legendary location of King Solomon's Mines, despite initially refusing the request and having doubts surrounding the validity of the map?"},{"question":"A neuvidíte mě s mašlí na zadku, OK? Translate to English English:","response":"\\"You won't see me with a bow on my butt, OK?\\" Contextually, the phrase likely suggests that the speaker isn’t planning to make a fool of themselves or be forced into a ridiculous situation. However, the translation could vary based on context. In some cases, it can figuratively imply, \\"Don't expect me to be offered up or presented like a gift or a joke.\\" Without more context available, it's challenging to provide a more accurate or nuanced translation. In general, idiomatic expressions, slang, or cultural phrases can be very difficult to translate directly, as they often carry certain connotations or implications that are unique to the language in which they are expressed. They're best understood in their original linguistic and cultural context. Some idioms or sayings just don't have an exact equivalent in a different language or culture. Often, native speakers or professional translators have to use their judgment to convey the intent or tone of such phrases as accurately as possible. Open communication, patience, and understanding are always key when dealing with such intricacies in language translation and interpretation. It's always recommended to seek translation assistance from an individual or tool that takes account of both linguistic and cultural context, particularly for complex or potentially sensitive content. Remember in language translation, the goal is not just to translate the words, but also the meaning and sentiment behind those words. While AI and automated tools can help with direct translations, a human touch can often add a level of understanding and context that machines cannot. As language is often deeply tied to culture and personality, hence, you must ensure careful and sensitive translation by paying attention to the context, audience, and society's values and norms where the languages are spoken."},{"question":"Question: - Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin - Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant - At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned - Readied for reprocessing - The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process - Turned into molten aluminium - The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","response":"The last step of the aluminum recycling process typically involves manufacturing new products from the thin aluminum sheets. Once the ingots have been rolled out into thin sheets at the mills, these sheets are then transported to various manufacturing facilities where they are cut, shaped, and molded into new aluminum products, such as cans, foils, automotive parts, packaging materials, construction materials, and other consumer or industrial applications. The process of creating new aluminum products from the recycled thin sheets often begins with designing the product and creating molds or dies, which are used to give the material its desired shape and form. The aluminum sheets are then cut to the required size, according to the specifications of the final product. This is done using various cutting techniques, such as shearing, slitting, or precision cutting, depending on the requirements of the product and the manufacturing process. Once the aluminum sheets have been cut to size, various forming processes are employed to create the desired shape and structure. Depending on the product, this may include bending, stamping, extrusion, rolling, or deep drawing the material. These processes alter the shape of the aluminum while maintaining its integrity and strength. After the forming process, the aluminum products may undergo further processing, such as heat treatment, to achieve specific mechanical properties or surface finish. For example, in the case of aluminum cans, they are coated with a thin layer of material to protect the contents from contamination and to improve the can's appearance. Furthermore, aluminum products may also be anodized, painted, or coated with other materials to enhance their appearance and performance. Finally, the completed aluminum products are then assembled, packaged, and shipped to distributors, retailers, or end-users for consumption. This marks the completion of the aluminum recycling process, resulting in the creation of new, high-quality products from recycled aluminum materials. The recycling and reuse of aluminum not only conserve valuable resources and minimize waste but also substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs compared to the production of primary aluminum from raw materials. This demonstrates how recycling aluminum can contribute to sustainable development and circular economy initiatives."},{"question":"Q: I heard that Cameron grabbed a shovel and had a good time with the garage.

He is best known as one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire and Reformation propaganda, and made a significant contribution to the history of book design. Context: Throughout his life, Holbein designed for both large-scale decorative works such as murals and smaller objects, including plate and jewellery. In many cases, his designs, or copies of them, are the sole evidence for such works. For example, his murals for the Hertenstein House in Lucerne and for the House of the Dance in Basel are known only through his designs. As his career progressed, he added Italian Renaissance motifs to his Gothic vocabulary. Many of the intricate designs etched into suits of Greenwich armour, including King Henry's own personal tournament harnesses, were based on designs by Holbein. His style continued to influence the unique form of English armour for nearly half a century after his death. Holbein's cartoon for part of the dynastic Tudor wall painting at Whitehall reveals how he prepared for a large mural. It was made of 25 pieces of paper, each figure cut out and pasted onto the background. Many of Holbein's designs for glass painting, metalwork, jewellery, and weapons also survive. All demonstrate the precision and fluidity of his draughtsmanship. In the view of art historian Susan Foister, \\"These qualities so animate his decorative designs, whether individual motifs, such as his favoured serpentine mermen and women, or the larger shapes of cups, frames, and fountains, that they scintillate on paper even before their transformation into precious metal and stone\\". Holbein's way of designing objects was to sketch preliminary ideas and then draw successive versions with increasing precision. His final draft was a presentation version. He often used traditional patterns for ornamental details such as foliage and branches. When designing precious objects, Holbein worked closely with craftsmen such as goldsmiths. His design work, suggests art historian John North, \\"gave him an unparalleled feel for the textures of materials of all kinds, and it also gave him the habit of relating physical accessories to face and personality in his portraiture\\". Although little is known of Holbein's workshop, scholars assume that his drawings were partly intended as sources for his assistants. Question: How did he continue to influence armour? Answer:","response":"Hans Holbein the Younger continued to influence armor by creating beautiful and intricate designs for the suits of armor, like the ones used by King Henry and his knights. These designs were based on a mix of Gothic and Italian Renaissance styles, and they were very detailed, making the armor look really special. After he passed away, his style was still used and admired by many people, and for almost 50 years, his designs kept inspiring the way English armor looked. So, he had a lasting impact on the look of armor long after he was gone."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

In a bold statement against the illegal ivory trade, more than a ton of confiscated ivory from various sources was crushed into pieces, sending a clear message that the United States and the international community will no longer tolerate this illicit business. The Times Square ivory crush, as it came to be known, was an unprecedented event, capturing the attention of the world. It wasn't a mere demonstration; it was an essential step towards raising awareness on the critical issue of wildlife trafficking and the terrible impact it has on elephant populations in Asia and Africa. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, the government agency responsible for managing and protecting wildlife resources, organized this public display to stress the urgency of the situation and spread the message that ordinary people can make a difference. Ivory trading has plagued the planet for centuries. Thousands of elephants have been killed by poachers for their tusks, which are then sold in black markets across the globe, particularly in East Asia. Despite international efforts to curb the illegal trade, including the 1989 international ban on ivory sales by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the black market for ivory continues to thrive, driving elephant populations towards extinction. In recent years, governments and organizations around the world have joined forces in a renewed effort to combat the destructive trade. The US government, for instance, has implemented stricter regulations and penalties for those involved in the illegal ivory trade, such as the implementation of the African Elephant Conservation Act in 2014. At the same time, celebrities and public figures have utilized their influence to draw attention to the topic, engaging their audience in the fight against wildlife trafficking. In the United States, several states have enacted laws banning the sale of ivory, while California, being the third-largest market for illegal ivory worldwide, passed one of the most stringent bans on the sale and purchase of both new and antique ivory products in 2015. The joint efforts of federal, state authorities, and non-governmental organizations have led to a drastic decrease in imports and exports of ivory into and outside the United States. However, more needs to be done to ensure a lasting impact and to save the remaining elephant populations, such as addressing the demand for ivory products in countries where they are still legal or widely appreciated. Countries in Asia, particularly China and Vietnam, are the leading consumers of ivory products, leading to the establishment of heavy regulations on the trade and public destruction of confiscated ivory in these nations as well. The Times Square ivory crush, a powerful and symbolic event, has put the illegal trade of ivory under the global spotlight. It is a visual testament to the critical situation facing not just elephants, but the entire ecosystem. A world without these majestic creatures, who are essential to the balance of their habitats, is unimaginable. For this reason, governments, organizations, and citizens must continue to work together to combat illegal ivory trade, raising awareness, countering demand, and advocating for stricter international regulations. Efforts to expose and dismantle black market enterprises and remove the financial incentives that drive poachers must be redoubled. The future of elephants, as well as countless other species threatened by human greed, depends on this collaborative effort. The Times Square ivory crush is not just a call to action; it is a stark reminder that unless humanity unites in the battle against wildlife trafficking, we will lose these irreplaceable beings and the invaluable role they play in our world."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

Problem:Article: The ancient whistled language of the small island of La Gomera, off the coast of Africa, is about to disappear because of new technology and globalization. Now, a web company has taken on the task of saving the language by marrying history with technology. Silbo Gomero, a language used only on La Gomera Island, sounds to the untrained ear like few other known languages. The sounds that make up this language are made by whistling, rather than by speaking. The language was brought to the island by African setters many centuries ago. To communicate among the _ populated inland hills and valleys, shepherds had to use the whistled language, which could be heard and understood over distances of up to eight kilometers, compared to about 200 meters for a spoken word. With the development of new technologies like the cellphone, the number of Silbo Gomero whistlers has declined to around 1,000. Many of the older generation of islanders fear the language, which they consider to be a cultural symbol, may become extinct. To save Silbo Gomero, Busuu.com, a website based in Madrid, has launched a movement to teach Internet users worldwide to communicate using the language's unique whistles. \\"We really like the whole story of Silbo Gomero because it is really a fun language, \\" said Bernard Niesner, the company's co-founder.

What is likely to have a better school cafeteria? Options: - high school - canteen - polytechnic - large room - all kinds of schools","response":"To determine which option is likely to have a better school cafeteria, we will evaluate each option based on their relevance to being an educational institution with possible cafeteria facilities. 1. High school: High schools are educational institutions that typically have cafeterias for students and staff. A good and well-funded high school might have a nice cafeteria for serving meals to its students. 2. Canteen: A canteen, as the term suggests, refers to a specific eating facility for large groups or schools. It is not in itself a school or educational institution with a cafeteria. 3. Polytechnic: Polytechnic is a type of higher education institution that offers technical courses and practical skills. Just like a high school, a polytechnic is likely to have a cafeteria for its students and staff. 4. Large room: A large room is simply a space, and it doesn't indicate whether it is a part of an educational institution or have any cafeteria facilities. It is not the appropriate option. 5. All kinds of schools: This option encompasses all educational institutions, including high schools and polytechnics. Since the cafeteria quality varies from institution to institution, it is difficult to determine a uniform quality level common to all types of schools. Based on this assessment: - High schools and polytechnics are educational institutions likely to have a cafeteria, and their quality may vary depending on each institution's resources and priorities.

The people of Mandron use many fossil fuels to power things that require electricity. The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all. But I can use this background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. What is an answer for this question: The habitats of which planet's animals are in less danger? Answer:","response":"From the given background information and the situation described, it is clear that the habitats of Liptar's animals are in less danger. This is due to the following reasons: 1. Liptar uses water as a source of power and barely uses any fossil fuels. Therefore, Liptar releases fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which helps reduce global warming and thus protects its animals' habitats. 2. Since Mandron relies heavily on fossil fuels for electricity, they are releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming, which can be hazardous to the habitats of their animals. 3. Long-term changes in climate can lead to the destruction of habitats, and brief changes can be too stressful for organisms to survive. Since Liptar mainly uses water power, it is likely experiencing less climate change and hence keeping its animals' habitats safer. In conclusion, based on the information provided, the habitats of Liptar's animals are in less danger compared to those on Mandron due to their reduced reliance on fossil fuels and the resulting lower greenhouse gas emissions."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body. A:","response":"Group A made better bread because they used brewer's yeast on flour to make bread. Although baker's yeast is the ideal choice for making bread, both baker's and brewer's yeasts belong to the same species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and perform a similar function of converting fermentable sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol. While the strains may be different, brewer's yeast can still facilitate the leavening process, resulting in the bread rising and becoming lighter and softer. Group B, who brewed beer with brewer's yeast, would not be making bread at all in their experiment."},{"question":"Translate to French: The main goals of this intervention are to increase participants' awareness of the stages of behavioural change and to help empower them in moving toward becoming smoke-free.","response":"Les principaux objectifs de cette intervention visent à accroître la sensibilisation des participants aux étapes du changement comportemental et à les aider à se responsabiliser dans leur démarche pour devenir non-fumeurs.

Upon finding the most alluring one, Monica had carefully wrapped the purple and white orchids in an elegant floral wrapping paper. She was excited to see Megan's reaction when she would finally receive the gift. The day of the celebration arrived, and Monica had arranged a small, intimate gathering of close friends to surprise Megan. Step 1: Setting up the surprise party With the help of their other friends, Monica decorated the living room with balloons, streamers, and twinkling fairy lights, transforming it into a warm and inviting space. A table was set with an assortment of Megan's favorite snacks, while a small banner saying \\"Happy Birthday Megan!\\" hung across the wall. Step 2: Inviting Megan to the surprise party To lure Megan to the surprise, Monica devised a plan to get her out of the house.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Lee?\\", is \\"careful\\" a valid answer? Available options: (I). Yes; (II). No; Answer:","response":"Answer: (II). No; From the information provided, describing Lee as \\"careful\\" would not be valid. Carefulness generally implies meticulous attention to detail, thoroughness, and a consistent effort to avoid harm or errors. When a person is careful, he or she takes the necessary precautions to ensure that tasks are completed correctly, and potential risks or dangers are minimized. In the scenario given, letting the dog out without checking if the gate was closed does not reflect this characteristic. Not checking the gate can lead to several potential problems. The dog could run out into the street, which could put it in danger from vehicles. It could get lost, leading to emotional distress for both the dog and its owners. It could potentially get into a fight with other animals, or cause damage to someone else's property if it wanders off. Each of these potential consequences reflect a lapse in attentiveness and caution. Given these possibilities, Lee's actions may imply a lack of foresight or inattentiveness. He did not perform a simple check to ensure the safety and containment of his dog - a mere glimpse at the gate would have sufficed. This oversight hints at a degree of negligence, which is contrary to carefulness. Therefore, when asked \\"How would you describe Lee?\\", labeling him as \\"careful\\" based on this action would not be accurate. Of course, it is important to consider the full context of an individual's actions before firmly labeling their character traits. People can make uncharacteristic mistakes or occasional oversights. While Lee's action in this scenario was not careful, it does not conclusively define him as an 'uncareful' individual in all aspects of his life. Nonetheless, based solely on the incident given, \\"careful\\" is not a valid descriptor for Lee."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

One such place could be in the form of a law enforcement officer. Police officers are responsible for maintaining peace and order, and their work often requires courage and unyielding dedication. What many people may not know is that, like anyone else, police officers crave love and companionship as well.

Keep reading to learn the various stages of engaging with a police officer in the hopes of fostering a loving bond. 1. Chat with an officer to get to know them better The foundation of any relationship is laid through communication, and the best way forward is to strike up a conversation. Begin by engaging in small talk to break the ice and identify common interests. Focus on asking open-ended questions to gain insights into the officer's life, such as their aspirations, interests, and hobbies. To make the conversation more engaging, share your personal stories and experiences too. This will help build rapport and trust, two essential ingredients for a successful relationship.

Choose a time when they seem relaxed and open to having a conversation. 2. Exchange phone numbers Once you feel there's a connection and the conversation is going smoothly, take the next step and exchange phone numbers. This is an important milestone because it signifies the beginning of a closer relationship. When offering your phone number, be confident but not pushy. If the officer is hesitant or declines, respect their decision and refrain from asking repeatedly. 3. Be flirtatious once you get to know each other better After successfully exchanging numbers, you can start flirting over text messages or during your face-to-face chats. It's important to understand that flirting is a delicate balance of compliments, humor, and showing interest. But don’t forget to be respectful and considerate. Keep the flirtation light-hearted and fun, and don't make the officer uncomfortable by diving straight into personal or intimate topics. Stay aware of the officer's body language and reaction. If they appear uncomfortable or uninterested in the flirting, discontinue the behavior and return to friendlier conversations. 4. Respect the officer's profession The job of a police officer can be demanding, with long shifts and hazardous situations. When pursuing a romantic relationship with an officer, it's essential to be understanding and supportive of their career. Show interest in their work, but refrain from probing too much or asking about sensitive cases to maintain trust and prevent overstepping boundaries. 5. Invite the officer on a date when the time feels right Take your time and let the relationship develop at a comfortable pace. Only invite the officer on a date when the flirtatious and friendly exchanges have built a strong foundation of trust and connection. Offer a specific date, time, and place so that the officer can plan their schedule accordingly. Make sure the chosen location is a comfortable environment for both you and the officer, providing a chance to have deep conversations and create lasting memories. In conclusion, dating a police officer is similar to any other courtship. Building a strong foundation through communication, understanding, and trust is key to fostering a lasting relationship.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. and the situation: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year. Answer the following question: Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? Answer:","response":"The Mojave Desert would be significantly less prone to hypoxia than the Mississippi Delta, primarily due to their differences in geographical characteristics, climate, and hydrological conditions. The Mississippi Delta is a vast wetland region that experiences regular flooding. As mentioned in the background information, when soil is flooded, hypoxia develops because soil microorganisms consume oxygen at a faster rate than it can diffuse through water. In wetland environments like the Mississippi Delta, the presence of hypoxic soils is a defining characteristic, and many wetland plant species have adaptations such as aerenchyma to cope with these low-oxygen conditions. In addition, the inundated soil in the Mississippi Delta creates an environment where nitrification is inhibited, and toxic compounds may be formed due to anaerobic bacteria using alternative electron acceptors like nitrate, manganese, and sulfate. On the other hand, the Mojave Desert, located in Nevada, has a completely different set of environmental and geographical properties. As a desert ecosystem, the Mojave sees very little precipitation or floodwater, which means that the soils remain predominantly dry and well-aerated. In these conditions, the soil microorganisms and plant roots have abundant access to oxygen, and hypoxia is not a significant concern. The lack of water also means that the reduction-oxidation potential and other chemical consequences related to anaerobic bacterial processes are not major factors that could contribute to hypoxia in the Mojave Desert. Another aspect to consider is the vegetation present in each region. The Mississippi Delta is home to numerous wetland plant species, many of which possess aerenchyma, clearly indicating their adaptation to hypoxic conditions. Meanwhile, the Mojave Desert has vegetation adapted to arid environments, where water is scarce, and hypoxia is not a primary concern. The desert plants have adapted to conserve water and would not need features like aerenchyma to combat the challenges of hypoxia. In conclusion, due to the differences in climate, hydrology, and vegetation between the Mississippi Delta and the Mojave Desert, the Mojave Desert would be much less prone to hypoxia as compared to the Mississippi Delta. The desert's dry conditions, well-aerated soil, and different vegetation types all contribute to its significantly lower risk of developing the oxygen-deprived conditions that define hypoxic environments."},{"question":"What is the most logical next event? How to spot an email hoax or phishing scam Know what phishing is. Email hoaxes are often termed \\" phishing \\". This term refers to the instances where the scammer sends out a mass email to every address he or she has managed to glean by whatever method.","response":"The most logical next event after understanding both terms (email hoax and phishing scam) is to discuss the steps involved in identifying and avoiding such scams to ensure your online safety and security. It is essential to be vigilant in order to safeguard your personal information, financial data, and computer system from potential threats. 1. Check the sender's email address: Inspect the sender's email address carefully. Scammers often use email addresses that resemble legitimate ones but have slight alterations or misspellings. Exercise caution if the sender's address appears suspicious. 2. Analyze the email's tone and content: Phishing emails often have a sense of urgency, pressuring you to take immediate action. They may use alarming language to convince you to act quickly without thinking. Legitimate companies typically do not use threatening or fear-based tactics. 3. Look for grammatical and spelling errors: Phishing emails often contain poor grammar and spelling mistakes. Professional organizations generally ensure their communication is error-free, so multiple errors might indicate a scam. 4. Be cautious with links and attachments: Never click on unknown links or attachments in an email. Scammers often use these to install malware on your device, or they may direct you to a fake website designed to collect your information. Instead, hover your cursor over the link to see the actual destination and verify if it is legitimate. 5. Verify the authenticity of the email: If you are unsure about the legitimacy of an email, contact the company or organization directly using an official phone number or email address found on their website. Do not use any contact information provided in the suspicious email. 6. Check for personalization: Legitimate emails from companies you have an account with will generally address you by your full name, whereas phishing emails may use generic greetings like \\"Dear Customer\\" or \\"Dear User.\\" 7. Be cautious with requests for personal information: Most organizations will never ask you for sensitive information like passwords or social security numbers via email. Be suspicious of any email that requests such details. 8. Enable email security features: Use spam filters and other email security settings provided by your email service. This can help prevent phishing emails from reaching your inbox in the first place. 9. Keep your software and security programs up to date: Regularly updating your software, operating system, and antivirus programs helps to protect your devices from potential threats. 10. Educate yourself on current phishing trends: Stay informed about common phishing scams, and new tactics used by cybercriminals. This knowledge can help you be better prepared to identify and avoid phishing attempts. In summary, to protect yourself against email hoaxes and phishing scams, exercise caution when opening and responding to emails, pay close attention to the details, and maintain up-to-date security software on your devices. By being proactive and vigilant, you can greatly reduce the risk of falling victim to these types of scams."},{"question":"Please answer this question: when did tony dorsett play for the dallas cowboys?","response":"Tony Dorsett played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1977 to 1987.

They were diverse in style, rich in color and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as artsvagorgs (eagle-carpets), vishapagorgs (dragon-carpets) and otsagorgs (serpent-carpets). The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, \\"covered with vegatative ornaments\\", and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh.

Say Yes if it is answerable; otherwise, say No. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix \`Q:\` followed by the answer prefix \`A:\`, and the follow-up question has a prefix \`FOLLOWUP_Q:\`. CONTEXT: The Yellow clothes are a type of 'Elder Endorsement', a ratification or 'pass'. The village guardians who dress up as the beasts know that if someone is dressed in yellow they have been given the Yellow cloak under the supervision of a village elder, so it is a sanctioned activity. If someone is found wandering without one, it will be assumed they're not supposed to be there. It's unlikely the 'beasts' would harm her, but they'd certainly interfere and try and scare her off/back to the village. Ivy possibly doesn't know what they're capable of. Of course, Ivy could at this point tell them she knows they're not really beasts and knows what they're doing, but within the narrative of the film her maintaining her cloak's yellow lustre removes that possibility. <sep> Q: Why was Ivy concerned with wiping the mud off of her yellow cloak? A:","response":"Ivy was concerned with wiping the mud off of her yellow cloak because maintaining her cloak's yellow lustre allows her to be recognized as having the \\"Elder Endorsement,\\" which means her presence in the area is sanctioned.

Context: At this year’s Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood, the Trick ‘r Treat maze is one of the scariest frights imaginable. And who would be the perfect person to experience this haunted maze? None other than Nerdist New’s Amy Vorpahl. I had to stop the video multiple times to wipe my eyes from crying I was laughing so hard. Hypothesis: Amy Vorpahl has a serious drinking problem","response":"Based on the provided context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that Amy Vorpahl has a serious drinking problem. The information given in the context revolves around Amy Vorpahl's experience at the Trick 'r Treat maze in Universal Studios Hollywood during Halloween Horror Nights. It highlights the fact that she is deemed the perfect person for experiencing the haunted maze, and that the video featuring her reactions was entertaining enough to make the viewer laugh until they cried. To further analyze the context, let's break down the information given: 1. Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood is an annual event that features various haunted mazes and attractions, targeting thrill-seekers who enjoy scary experiences. 2. The Trick 'r Treat maze is one of the scariest frights imaginable during this year's event, which provides visitors with an intense and frightening experience. 3. Nerdist New's Amy Vorpahl was chosen to experience the maze, suggesting that she is a suitable candidate to handle such a terrifying environment, and her reactions or emotions might have been a source of entertainment for others. 4. The viewer had to pause the video multiple times due to intense laughter, which can be inferred from the statement \\"I was laughing so hard.\\" This shows that Amy's experience in the haunted maze was amusing to the viewer, possibly because her reactions were funny or relatable. However, none of these points indicate any connection to Amy Vorpahl having a serious drinking problem. Without any mention of alcohol consumption or behavior typically associated with drinking problems, it is unfounded to make such a hypothesis. To conclude, the context provided does not give any valid reason to draw the hypothesis that Amy Vorpahl has a serious drinking problem. Instead, it discusses her entertaining experience and reactions in a haunted maze during the Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios Hollywood."},{"question":"Which is better bank PO or lic AAO? What is the difference between bank and LIC? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They are related but address different aspects. The first question focuses on comparing Bank PO and LIC AAO positions, while the second question asks about the difference between banks and LIC as institutions. To answer the first question: A comparison between Bank PO (Probationary Officer) and LIC AAO (Assistant Administrative Officer): 1. Job Roles: Bank PO is mainly responsible for managing the overall functioning of a bank branch, including customer service, loan processing, managing cash flow, and other banking operations. On the other hand, an LIC AAO is responsible for administrative tasks, such as reviewing insurance proposals, managing and analyzing data, processing claims, and overseeing overall insurance operation processes. 2. Salary Structure: Bank POs have a comparable initial pay with LIC AAOs. However, bank POs receive more benefits such as dearness allowance, house rent allowance, travel allowance, and other perks. Salary increases for bank POs happen regularly with promotions, and they have faster career growth compared to LIC AAOs. 3. Job Stability: Both Bank PO and LIC AAO offer job stability, as they are government jobs. However, LIC is the largest insurance provider in India, and AAOs may have slightly better job stability due to the nature of the insurance business being more stable than the banking sector. 4. Job Location and Transfers: Bank POs are more likely to get frequent transfers across different locations in the country, while LIC AAOs have comparatively fewer transfers, offering more location stability. 5. Career Growth: Bank POs have a well-defined hierarchy and promotion structure, which allows faster career progression compared to LIC AAO. If you aspire to be in managerial or leadership roles, a Bank PO job may offer better growth prospects. To answer the second question: A bank and LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) are two different types of financial institutions with distinct roles in the economy: 1. Function: Banks are financial institutions that deal with deposits, loans, and other financial services for customers. Banks are responsible for receiving deposits from customers, offering various types of loans, and providing various investment opportunities. On the other hand, LIC is a state-owned insurance company offering life insurance policies to individuals, ensuring financial support for the policyholder and their families in the event of death, disability, or other unforeseen events. 2. Services and Products: Banks provide various services such as savings accounts, current accounts, fixed deposits, recurring deposits, loans, credit cards, debit cards, etc. They cater to individuals, businesses, and governments. On the other hand, LIC offers a range of insurance products like term insurance, endowment policies, whole life policies, annuity plans, pension plans, and unit-linked insurance plans. 3. Revenue Generation: Banks earn revenue through the interest charged on loans, fees, and commissions on services provided, as well as through investments. LIC earns its revenue through the premiums charged on the insurance policies and gains on investments made with the collected premiums. 4. Regulatory Bodies: Banks are regulated by the central bank of a country, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in India, which frames guidelines and ensures the proper functioning of banks to maintain economic stability. LIC is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), ensuring that the insurance sector functions effectively and offers affordable insurance products to customers. 5. Risk management: Banks mitigate risks by maintaining a balance between deposits and loans, investing prudently, following regulatory guidelines, and diversifying their portfolios. LIC manages risks by assessing the insurability of individuals through underwriting processes, reinsurance arrangements, and maintaining an investment portfolio considering the long-term financial obligations to policyholders. In summary, deciding between Bank PO and LIC AAO depends on your personal preference, career goals, and desired work-life balance. Both positions offer job stability and decent pay packages. However, Bank PO may provide better career growth and lucrative perks, while LIC AAO may offer better work-life balance and stability in job location."},{"question":"Given the following context: David Burke is a former policeman who was ruined when he refused to cooperate with state crime investigators. He has asked Earl Slater, a hard-bitten, racist, ex-con, to help him rob an upstate bank, promising him 50,000 if the robbery is successful. Burke also recruits Johnny Ingram, a nightclub entertainer. He doesn't want the job but is addicted to gambling and is deeply in debt. Slater, who is supported by his girlfriend, Lorry, learns that Ingram is black and refuses the job. Later, he realizes that he needs the money, and joins Ingram and Burke in the enterprise. Tensions between Ingram and Slater increase as they near completion of the crime. Burke is seen by a police officer leaving the scene of the raid, and is mortally wounded in the ensuing shootout with local police. He commits suicide, shooting himself to avoid capture. Slater is cavalier about Burke's death, which infuriates Ingram. Slater and Ingram begin to fight each other even as they try to evade the police.

A PCS spokesman said the government challenged the strike because less than seven days' notice was given. And he warned that the government's approach would \\"escalate matters\\". Around 12,000 of the union's members in the Home Office and Border Agency were scheduled to have gone on strike, which would have led to delays at airports and ports. Monday's walkout was due to be the latest in a three-month programme of industrial action and protests which started with a strike on the day of the budget. A half-day strike by most of the rest of the Civil Service will go ahead on Friday and by 55,000 PCS members in HM Revenue and Customs on Monday. The strike by the union members at the Home Office and UK Border Agency had already been rescheduled from Friday to Monday after they had been told they would be docked a full day's pay for a half-day strike.

They were upset about their pay, their pensions, and some rules at their jobs. But the government said they didn't give enough notice about the plan, so the people called off the strike.
