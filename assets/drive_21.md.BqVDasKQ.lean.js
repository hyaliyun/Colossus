Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”.

Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried.

It does not specify any particular game or game developer and can cover a wide range of topics related to hacking or exploiting online games in general. This question has potential illicit implications as hacking games often violates terms of service and legal agreements. The answer to this question would not be suitable to provide as it would encourage unethical behavior and potentially illegal activities. The second question, \\"Can you hack upjers online games?\\" is a more specific inquiry focused on a particular game developer, upjers.

Jacarandas thrive with sun, and should be planted in an area that will receive frequent, direct sunlight for most of the year. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from any nearby buildings, and do not plant seedlings in the shade of other, larger trees. Jacaranda trees will suffer if their roots don’t drain well, and they need fertile, rich soil to provide them with nutrients. If you’re planting your tree in a large planter or pot, place the jacaranda in a rich soil mixture. A local nursery or Garden center should have a variety of soil bags for sale, and sales staff can help you select a healthy mixture for your jacaranda. If you plant the tree directly into the ground, you’ll have less control over the makeup of the soil than if you were buying it from a plant nursery. Look for a patch of soil that isn’t prone to having puddles and has other plants already growing in it. Jacarandas need frequent watering in order to grow and thrive in temperate climates. Healthy jacaranda trees grow quickly, but will wilt and possibly die if given insufficient water. Between March and October, use a household hose to water the jacaranda tree about once a week. During the cooler winter months, you do not need to water the tree as regularly. The jacaranda will not be growing during November through February, and so you should only water the tree about once a month. Although they begin small as seedlings, jacarandas can grow into massive trees. Jacarandas commonly reach between 25-50 feet (7.6-15 meters) in height and can have a width of 15-30 feet (4.5-9 meters). Plant the jacaranda in a large, open area where it will have room to grow to its full size. For example, jacarandas do well in large front or back yards. If you plant the jacaranda in an already cramped or crowded space (e.g. under a patio roof or between narrow walls) it will not grow to its full size and may wither and become unhealthy. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from homes and other structures so that falling branches are less likely to cause damage.","response":"To grow a jacaranda tree, plant it in a sunny area with good drainage, give it plenty of space, water it regularly, and use rich soil."},{"question":"Very nice staff.

For at least three days in a row, the People's Bank of China did not conduct any reverse repo operations—causing 58 billion yuan (9.5 billion) to be removed from the system this week, on top of 45 billion last week, according to Chinese media. The moves may be in response to recent inflation and housing-price data which have shown increases despite the central government's attempts to slow down both, especially the housing market. (Read more: Shanghai shares fall to lowest in a month) In a related event announced on Friday, China has launched a benchmark lending rate for the first time.

Alex is dutifully helping Addison in maintaining the balance. As for Addison's feelings, multiple emotions might apply. Here are a few possible feelings Addison might experience as a result: 1. Grateful: Addison might feel grateful that Alex is helping her maintain her financial balance. Having someone to assist and watch over her financial habits can be reassuring since she doesn't have to face these challenges alone. 2. Relieved: As Addison struggles with managing her finances, having Alex's help can be calming and stress-relieving. It takes some of the pressure off her shoulders because she knows that there will be support to ensure her financial stability. 3. Insecure: The fact that Addison is not good with money and needs Alex to maintain her balance may also lead her to feel insecure about her financial skills. These feelings of inadequacy can create self-doubt and a sense of dependency on Alex. 4. Motivated: Alex's help could also inspire Addison to strive for improvement in her financial management skills. This recognition of her shortcomings might be the catalyst for growth and the development of better habits for maintaining her own financial stability. 5. Guilty: Addison could feel a sense of guilt for relying on Alex to handle her financial responsibilities. She might perceive it as placing an unnecessary burden on her friend. In conclusion, \\"dutiful\\" isn't a valid answer to describe Addison's feelings as a result of Alex keeping her financial balance. Instead, other emotions such as gratitude, relief, insecurity, motivation, or guilt might more accurately capture her feelings in this situation."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Awful Review: These are terrible.

The wood frog has garnered attention by biologists over the last century because of its freeze tolerance, relatively great degree of terrestrialism (for a ranid), interesting habitat associations (peat bogs, vernal pools, uplands), and relatively long-range movements. The ecology and conservation of the wood frog has attracted research attention in recent years because they are often considered \\"obligate\\" breeders in ephemeral wetlands (sometimes called \\"vernal pools\\") that are themselves more imperiled than the species that breed in them. The wood frog has been proposed to be the official state amphibian of New York. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - The true frogs, family Ranidae, have the widest distribution of any frog family. They are abundant throughout most of the world, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. The true frogs are present in North America, northern South America, Europe, Asia, Madagascar, Africa, and from the East Indies to New Guinea; the species native to Australiathe Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemelii\\")is restricted to the far north. - The Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemeli\\"), locally simply known as the wood frog, is the only species from the family Ranidae found in Australia. The species is restricted to the rainforest of northern Queensland, the eastern border of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, and much of New Guinea. Long placed in the \\"wastebin genus\\" \\"Rana\\", it is now in \\"Hylarana\\" together with such species as the common green frog of Southeast Asia. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - The southern leopard frog ( Rana sphenocephala ) is a species of mostly aquatic true frog , found in the south - eastern third of the United States . There are two accepted subspecies . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.

The spree, which ranged over several locations and injured at least two children at Rancho Tehama Elementary School, ended when the killer — identified in several reports as Kevin Janson Neal — was shot dead by law enforcement officers.

Two people died near the gunman’s home, including a woman living nearby with whom the shooter had a running dispute, said county Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston. Her name and those of the other victims have not been released. Johnston would not confirm that Neal was the gunman. In January, the gunman was arrested in connection with an assault involving the woman, Johnston said, and a restraining order had been issued against him in connection with that arrest. He also said the gunman had been out on bail and that police had responded to a “domestic violence” incident involving him Monday, but did not provide details. After the initial shootings near the killer’s home on Bobcat Lane, the gunman stole a vehicle and began driving toward the elementary school, shooting randomly at people and homes on the way, Johnston said. “This guy was bent on driving by residences and arbitrarily shooting at them,” Johnston said. “This guy was on a killing rampage.” At the school, teachers heard the sounds of gunfire and quickly ordered a lockdown. Almost simultaneously, the shooter drove onto the school property at high speed in a white pickup, came out of the truck with a semiautomatic rifle and started shooting, said Rick Fitzpatrick, superintendent of the Corning Union Elementary School District. The gunman shot at classrooms and tried but failed to get inside, Johnston said. No students or school employees were among the dead. “The quick action of the school officials saved countless lives and children,” Johnston said. “It was monumental.” He said the wounded victims included at least one student inside the school and a woman and a child in a car outside, authorities said. The woman’s injuries were described by authorities as “life-threatening.” Johnston said the woman “had no clue who he was or why” the shooter had opened fire. “This was a bizarre, murderous rampage (to) get even with a neighbor,” Johnston said. Apparently “frustrated that he was unable to get into the classrooms,” Johnston said, the gunman drove off. Over the course of the next quarter hour or so, he shot at several more people at random, crashed his stolen vehicle and commandeered another one. The rampage ended at what Johnston described only as an “intersection,” where two unidentified law enforcement officers spotted the man and forced his car off the road. “The suspect shot at police out the window,” Johnston said. “There was an exchange of gunfire, resulting in (the gunman’s) death.” As the day went on, at least 100 officers collected evidence at seven crime scenes. They recovered a semiautomatic rifle, two handguns and at least one stolen vehicle. It was not immediately known whether the guns were registered to the killer, but Johnston said the man was not legally prohibited from possessing firearms. Johnston said the number of casualties could increase and that relatives of the gunman were unaccounted for. Near the school, a man who identified himself as Brian Flint said his roommate was one of the slain victims, and that the gunman was his neighbor, whom he identified as “Kevin.” Flint said the man had been acting “crazy” and firing guns before Tuesday, and had stolen his pickup truck during the rampage. Another witness said the gunman was a local resident who was “known to fire weapons nonstop.” Juan Caravez, the president of the local homeowners’ association, said his group had, in the past, received about two dozen complaints about the man. “We can always hear him shooting,” he said. “A lot of neighbors called. We would hear the shooting every day.” The proprietor of a coffee shop about a half-mile from the elementary school said she heard “at least 100 rounds” during Tuesday’s shooting attack. “After hearing the first 30 shots, we called 911,” said Tiffany Rodgers, who owns Coffee Addiction. “I heard people yelling, ‘Get down, get down.’’’ Rodgers said she also heard the “yelping of a dog” she believed had been shot. Sue Keating, who lives two blocks from the school, said a companion told her she heard many shots “and assumed someone was hunting.” Rancho Tehama Reserve is an unincorporated community. Its small downtown has a market, post office, an office building, a sandwich shop and the coffee shop. There is no stoplight. “We’ve never had something like this here, so you don’t think about it,” Keating said. Some of those wounded Tuesday were taken to Enloe Medical Center in Chico. Nicole Johansson, a spokeswoman for the medical center, said three people were treated and released and two patients remained hospitalized. She ,declined to disclose their conditions or say whether they were adults or children. A review of the police shooting will be run by the Red Bluff Police Department with assistance from the county district attorney’s office, the California Highway Patrol and the FBI. The violence came within seven weeks of three other horrific mass killings across the country. On Oct. 1, a gunman opened fire from a high-rise Las Vegas hotel onto a country music festival, killing 58 and wounding 546. On Oct. 31, a man in a truck deliberately ran over people on a New York City bike path, killing eight and wounding 11. On Nov. 5, a gunman opened fire in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 and injuring 20. Gov. Jerry Brown and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein issued statements Tuesday deploring the violence in California. Brown said he was “saddened to hear about today’s violence, which shockingly involved schoolchildren,” and Feinstein asked, “When will this stop and how can we stop it?” San Francisco Chronicle staff writer Annie Ma contributed to this report.

Their decision most likely prevented what was already a deadly rampage in this rural hamlet southwest of Red Bluff from becoming a bloodbath on the scale of Sandy Hook in Connecticut. Apparently infuriated by a longstanding dispute with neighbors, a gunman armed with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns shot four people to death in the tiny community of Rancho Tehama Reserve early Tuesday. Clad in a military-style assault vest capable of storing multiple rounds of ammunition, the man wounded at least 10 others before officers rammed into the stolen vehicle he was driving, shot him and killed him. The Tehama Sheriff’s Department said the number of fatalities might grow. Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said officials are worried because they’ve had trouble locating several of the gunman’s relatives. As bad as the spree was, Johnston said he was thankful it wasn’t worse. Although two young boys were shot in the early morning rampage, including one inside Rancho Tehama Elementary School, the assistant sheriff said no students or teachers were killed. He credited school officials with locking down the campus without even waiting for the customary notification from the Sheriff’s Department.

SUBSCRIBE NOW SHARE COPY LINK Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston gives details on the shooting that ended with five deaths including the suspected shooter. Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2017. The incident “could have been so much worse if it wasn’t for the quick thinking (of) staff at our elementary school,” Johnston said at a late afternoon press conference. “He couldn’t make access to any of the rooms; they were locked....This saved countless lives.” Multiple sources told The Sacramento Bee that the dead suspect was Kevin Janson Neal, 43. Johnston refused to confirm the identification, pending notification of family members. But he said one of the fatalities was a woman who lived near the suspect and was the victim of a late January assault that ended with the suspect in jail. Johnston added that he believed the suspect was slapped with a restraining order following the January arrest that would have prevented him from owning firearms for at least a period of time, although he had no details on that. Neal was initially jailed in late January in the assault case and was being held on 160,000 bail, according to the Red Bluff Daily News. In April the district attorney’s office charged him with assaulting a second woman, also in late January, according to Tehama County Superior Court records. Gregg Cohen, the Tehama district attorney, told The Bee that his office was prosecuting Neal on charges related to a stabbing and assault with a deadly weapon involving two of his neighbors. Neal’s mother told the Associated Press that her son called her on Monday, the day before the shooting, and indicated he was fed up with his neighbors, whom he said he suspected of making methamphetamine. “Mom, it’s all over now,” she said he told her. “I have done everything I could do and I am fighting against everyone who lives in this area....All of a sudden now I’m on a cliff and there’s nowhere to go. No matter where I go for help here, I get nobody who will help me. All they are doing is trying to execute me.” The mother, whom the AP identified only as “Anne,” said she posted Neal’s 160,000 bail and also spent 10,000 on his legal fees after his January arrest. The woman lives in Raleigh, N.C., where Neal was raised. Johnston said the gunman had one and possibly two rifles during the spree, including one that “appears to be an AR-type weapon,” as well as two handguns. He was wearing the type of vest worn by soldiers for carrying ammunition, Johnston said. Tuesday’s rampage, which lasted about 45 minutes, began on Bobcat Lane in Rancho Tehama, a rural community of 1,400 residents southwest of Red Bluff. That’s where the gunman killed his first two victims, including the woman victimized in the January assault. Brian Flint of Corning told The Record Searchlight newspaper that his roommate was one of those killed by the gunman, whom he identified only as “Kevin.” Flint said the suspect, who lived nearby, frequently shot hundreds of rounds from high-capacity magazines and had threatened him and his roommate in the past. After the shootings on Bobcat Lane, the gunman stole a white pickup truck that belonged to one of the victims and began making his way toward the school, firing shots at random passers-by along the way. “This is an individual that armed himself, I think with the motive of getting even with his neighbors,” Johnston said. “And when it got that far, (he) went on a rampage....He was driving up and down the street shooting at passerbys.” Other than the first two victims, “we know of no real connection to any of the victims,” Johnston said. “Most of the victims in this case appear to be random selections.” Several of his shots struck a car carrying a mom and her three children. The mother was severely injured and one of her sons was injured as well, although his wounds weren’t considered life threatening, Johnston said. “She was trying to drive herself to the hospital when I encountered her on the road,” Johnston said. “She told me that she doesn’t know this person.” Eyewitness Mariana Aguiniga said she was driving to Red Bluff when she heard shots and came upon a minivan driven by the woman. “She wanted to know if I could take her to the hospital. Then she showed me,” Aguiniga said, motioning to her back. “It was covered in blood.” By the time the shooter got to within a quarter mile of the school, school officials ordered the lockdown, Johnston said. The gunman crashed the vehicle, a pickup truck, through the gate of the school and prowled the yard for several minutes, able only to get inside a bathroom. Stephanie Turner, who was dropping off her 6-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, told The Sacramento Bee she saw the white pickup “rammed through the bus gate,” and then noticed a man stalking the school grounds. “I thought there was a car accident,” Turner said. “I pulled into the school and heard gunshots. I told my kids to get down onto the floor. Then I saw a guy in the back of the school with a rifle. As soon as he saw us, he started shooting at us. I just took off.” At some point he shot out several classroom windows, striking one of the students, before leaving the school grounds. School officials, in a statement released by Corning Union Elementary School District, said some students were injured by shattered glass. The student who was struck by gunfire was reported in stable condition, the district said. A cousin and uncle of the 6-year old boy shot at the elementary school identified him as Alejandro Hernandez. Arlene Monroy, 17, said she had been told her cousin was shot in the chest and leg, but was recovering and expected to be all right. The district said Rancho Tehama Elementary “is closed until further notice in order for law enforcement to complete its investigation and to make necessary repairs. The District will make alternate arrangements for student instruction.” Parent Coy Ferreira told Redding TV station KRCR that he was dropping his daughter off at kindergarten when he heard a shot. A school employee ran out and told the children to get in the classroom. “It sounded like a firecracker went off and we all stopped and were stunned. Then, like a minute later, there were three more shots fired,” Ferreira said. In the chaos, Ferreira said it appeared two children had been shot. Ferreira said he ran into a classroom with 14 students. He said a series of shots came through the classroom windows, hitting one student. Ferreira said a young boy was shot in the foot and the chest. He said another student in an adjacent classroom was shot under the arm. Both students were conscious, he said. “He became frustrated at not being able to get into the classroom,” Johnston said. “He went mobile again.” Getting back in the stolen pickup, the shooter drove along Stage Coach Road, one of the main thoroughfares of Rancho Tehama, and then rammed the truck into another car. He shot the two passengers as they tried to flee their vehicle, killing one and wounding the other. Johnston said he couldn’t provide details on the fourth death attributed to the gunman. The ordeal began to finally wind down when another passerby who was following the shooter stopped his car and asked if everyone was alright. The gunman then shot and wounded that man, grabbed his vehicle and took off. At that point law enforcement officers finally caught up with the gunman. Johnston said two officers rammed into his stolen vehicle, forcing him off the road. Shots were exchanged and the suspect was dead. Seven different shooting locations were being treated as separate crime scenes, and much of the Rancho Tehama community was locked for hours after the incident was over. The Sacramento Bee Rancho Tehama Reserve, located 12 miles west of I-5 between Red Bluff and Corning, is a rural, wooded subdivision that boasts views of Mt. Shasta and Mt. Lassen. It’s about 2 1/2 hours north of Sacramento. The 11-square-mile community has its own airstrip. Until Tuesday, the biggest controversy in Rancho Tehama came four years ago, when residents of the subdivision complained to county supervisors about marijuana being grown illegally throughout the subdivision. The county’s drug task force said it fielded hundreds of complaints about pot gardens in the area. “There’s a lot of druggies living out here,” said community resident Mel McNeil. “But there’s lots of druggies living everywhere.” Former Tehama County sheriff’s deputy Kyle Pflager, who runs a Facebook page that monitors local emergency services, said the area around the school is secluded. It was originally meant to be a retirement community but has evolved into a haven for marijuana growers. “It does not surprise me that it happened in Rancho Tehama,” Pflager said. “There is violence there … The whole area is just cluttered with marijuana gardens, everywhere. Pretty much when we went out there on patrol, you’d have to have two units at least. There is not much law enforcement presence out there. We don’t patrol there often.” Pflager said the school serves about 90 to 100 children. Plfager also said the area around the school was known to the department for lawlessness. “If you are trying to pull a car over, one out of every two cars would run,” Pflager said. “That’s the type of community out there.” The shooting drew the attention of elected officials across the state and the nation. “Anne and I are saddened to hear about today’s violence in Tehama County, which shockingly involved schoolchildren,” Brown said in a statement. “We offer our condolences to the families who lost loved ones and unite with all Californians in grief.” Vice President Mike Pence tweeted: “Saddened to hear of the shooting in N.

FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2012 file photo released by Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's Unha-3 rocket lifts off from the Sohae launch pad in Tongchang-ri, North Korea. The Cold War still rages in... (Associated Press) U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, center, is mobbed by journalists as he attends the opening session of the annual National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Tuesday, March... (Associated Press) Without elaborating, the Korean People's Army Supreme Command warned of \\"surgical strikes\\" meant to unify the divided Korean Peninsula and of an indigenous, \\"precision nuclear striking tool.\\" The statement came amid reports that Washington and North Korean ally Beijing have approved a draft of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for sanctions in response to North Korea's Feb. 12 nuclear test. The draft is expected to be circulated at the U.N. this week. Such heated military rhetoric and threats are common from North Korea as tensions rise on the Korean Peninsula, and Pyongyang's recent nuclear test and rocket launches, and the push for U.N. punishment that have followed, have increased already high animosity between the North and Washington and ally Seoul. The United States and others worry that North Korea's third nuclear test pushes it a step closer toward its goal of having nuclear-armed missiles that can reach America, and condemn its nuclear and missile efforts as threats to regional security and a drain on the resources that could go to North Korea's largely destitute people. North Korea says its nuclear program is a response to U.S. hostility that dates back to the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula still technically in a state of war. North Korea warned it will cancel the armistice agreement on March 11 because of ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that began March 1 which the statement called a \\"dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.\\" North Korea said Washington and others are going beyond mere economic sanctions and expanding into blunt aggression and military acts. North Korea also warned that it will block a communications line between it and the United States at the border village separating the two Koreas. \\"We aim to launch surgical strikes at any time and any target without being bounded by the armistice accord and advance our long-cherished wish for national unification,\\" the statement said. North Korea lays the blame for its much-condemned nuclear weapons programs on the United States. A rich vein of North Korean propaganda fueled by decades-old American threats holds that the North remains at risk of an unprovoked nuclear attack. Washington and others say brinksmanship is the North's true motive for the nuclear push. ___ Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"North Korea vowed on Tuesday to cancel the 1953 cease-fire that ended the Korean War in response to a U.S.-led push for punishing U.N. sanctions over its recent nuclear test and ongoing U.S.-South Korean joint military drills.

However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain. - Isalo National Park is a National Park in the Ihorombe Region of Madagascar .

Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Ihosy is a city (commune urbaine) with 16990 inhabitants (2004) in Ihorombe Region in central south Madagascar. - Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire.

These species are widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical Asia and tropical South America. While sedges may be found growing in almost all environments, many are associated with wetlands, or with poor soils. Ecological communities dominated by sedges are known as sedgelands. - Arenite (Latin \\"Arena\\", sand) is a sedimentary clastic rock with sand grain size between 0.0625 mm (0.00246 in) and 2 mm (0.08 in) and contain less than 15% matrix. The related adjective is \\"arenaceous\\".

Atsimo Andrefana is geographically the largest of all Malagasy regions with an area of . - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas. - The Malagasy Republic was a state situated in Southeast Africa.

The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering the possibility of making a car run solely on water, we must first evaluate the energy potential of water. Through normal combustion, water does not provide energy that can be easily harnessed for propulsion. However, water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen through a process called electrolysis. Hydrogen, when combined with oxygen, can produce electricity via fuel cells. But, this process requires electricity or another energy source to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water, which means that it's not solely powered by water but rather using water as an intermediate energy carrier. Additionally, converting a conventional car to run on hydrogen would likely be expensive and technically challenging. As a result, it is currently not feasible to make a car run solely on water, making the final answer \\"No.\\""},{"question":"Is the following a factual statement? \\"The Onion provides factual news reports and it is a reputable network for journalism.\\" Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"The statement is not factual. The Onion does not provide factual news reports and it is not a reputable network for journalism. Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. \\"The Onion\\" is an American digital media company that produces satirical articles, as well as videos, podcasts, and other forms of content. It was initially founded as a newspaper in 1988 before transitioning to a mainly online presence. 2. Satire, by its nature, is a form of humor that uses exaggeration, irony, and ridicule to criticize or comment on various topics, especially contemporary issues and current events. Thus, many of The Onion's articles are fictional and not meant to be taken as factual news. 3. Although some of the topics covered by The Onion may be based on true events, the specific details and narratives presented in its articles are usually embellished and fabricated for comedic purposes. This is a crucial distinction from factual journalism, which is dedicated to providing accurate, verifiable information to the public. 4. A reputable network for journalism is one that adheres to journalistic standards, such as impartiality, accuracy, and accountability. Since The Onion's main goal is to entertain and amuse through satire, it does not aim for the same objectives as reputable news sources. In conclusion, the statement that \\"The Onion provides factual news reports and it is a reputable network for journalism\\" is not correct. The Onion is a satirical media platform, and its content should not be considered as factual news or reliable journalism."},{"question":"Concepts: flower, gather, honey Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"Step 1: Identify the subject and verb.

His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (nee Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. Context: After returning to Grand Rapids in 1946, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to take on Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world. \\"I came back a converted internationalist\\", Ford wrote, \\"and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated isolationist. And I thought he ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one.\\" During his first campaign in 1948, Ford visited voters at their doorsteps and as they left the factories where they worked. Ford also visited local farms where, in one instance, a wager resulted in Ford spending two weeks milking cows following his election victory. Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding the Grand Rapids congressional district seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in The New York Times described him, Ford \\"saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career.\\" Appointed to the House Appropriations Committee two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Ford described his philosophy as \\"a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy.\\" Ford was known to his colleagues in the House as a \\"Congressman's Congressman\\". In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for either the Senate or the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House, which he called \\"the ultimate achievement. To sit up there and be the head honcho of 434 other people and have the responsibility, aside from the achievement, of trying to run the greatest legislative body in the history of mankind ... I think I got that ambition within a year or two after I was in the House of Representatives\\". Question: Why was this important Answer:","response":"The life and political career of Gerald Ford are important for several reasons, as his experiences and beliefs played significant roles in shaping his tenure as a Congressman and later, as the 38th President of the United States. Some factors that make this particularly important include: 1. Early life experiences: Ford's early life experiences, including his parents' separation, likely influenced his personality and character. Growing up amidst family challenges, Ford developed resilience and an ability to adapt to changing circumstances, qualities that would serve him well in his political career. 2. Military service and internationalism: Ford's military service during World War II played a crucial role in shaping his worldview. As he stated, he returned as a \\"converted internationalist,\\" prompting him to challenge the isolationist views of incumbent Republican Congressman Bartel J. Jonkman. This internationalist perspective would inform Ford's positions on foreign policy and national defense during his time in Congress and as President. 3. Commitment to public service: Ford's dedication to representing the people as a Congressman, as evidenced by his tireless campaigning and willingness to engage with constituents, showcases his commitment to public service. His ambition to become Speaker of the House reveals his desire to make an impact at the highest level of the legislative process. 4. Political pragmatism and moderation: Ford's self-described political philosophy of being \\"a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy\\" reflects his pragmatic approach to governance. His reputation as a \\"Congressman's Congressman\\" also highlights his ability to negotiate and reconcile differing viewpoints, which would prove invaluable during his presidency, particularly during the tumultuous era of the Watergate scandal and the aftermath of the Vietnam War. 5. Leadership during a time of crisis: Ford's ascension to the presidency following the resignation of Richard Nixon placed him in a unique and challenging historical context. His experience in the House of Representatives, his moderate approach to policymaking, and his ability to bring people together proved to be crucial in navigating the nation through a fraught period marked by political and economic challenges. In summary, the importance of Gerald Ford's life and political career lies in his unique experiences, commitment to public service, and pragmatic approach to governance. These qualities ultimately allowed him to lead the United States through a turbulent and difficult time in history, helping to restore public trust in government and steer the nation toward a path of healing and recovery."},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: 1 month ago 1000 JizzBunker doctor office close up orgasm","response":"1 month ago, 1000 JizzBunker: doctor office, close-up, orgasm.

How to translate an autocad drawing using translation memory and cat Get a text editor that supports unicode (such as the freeware babelpad). Open the dxf file in the text editor and search for the word acdbmtext. Search for \\" 1 \\" (two spaces and a number 1).","response":"After you search for \\"1\\", the following steps should be performed: - The search results for \\"1\\" will often be followed by the text in the AutoCAD drawing. This text is what you will need to translate. Make a note of each line that follows a \\"1\\" as you will be going back to these locations to replace the text with the translated versions. - Next, copy all the lines of text found in the DXF file and place them in a separate document. Now, split these lines of text into segments. In translation, a segment could be a sentence or phrase within a paragraph. This will make the translation process easier and more organized. - At this point, remember that translating drawings is not the same as translating a piece of writing. The language used in AutoCAD drawings is often more specialized and technical. It’s possible that your Translation Memory (TM) or Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tool will not have matches for all segments. So, besides using a TM and a CAT tool, you will likely also need to do research or consult with a specialist translator to ensure the translated text accurately conveys the original drawing’s meaning. - Now that your text is segmented, input these segments into your CAT tool or TM, depending on what you're using. The CAT or TM will provide you with close matches for the segments based upon its stored library of translations. For segments that do not have a match in the system, you will have to translate the segments manually. - Check the matches and suggestions provided by your CAT or TM, and pick the best options. For those not found in the CAT or TM, insert your manual translation. - Carefully review and proofread all translations for accuracy and consistency. Ensure technical terms are translated correctly according to industry standards, and that the translated text is contextually consistent with the drawing. - After finishing the translation process, return to the DXF file that was opened in the text editor. Navigate to the locations of each \\"1\\" and replace the original text with its corresponding translated text. Make sure you enter the text exactly as it was in the separate document, including any special formatting or symbols. - Finally, import the edited DXF file back into AutoCAD and review the translated drawing to ensure the context and layout of the text hasn’t changed or disturbed the original drawing elements. Remember, translating an AutoCAD drawing is a delicate task that requires a good understanding of both the languages and the technical terminologies in play. It's essential to maintain the precision and clarity of information while translating such technical drawings.

Step 3: Determine the most suitable option After eliminating the inappropriate options, we are left with the \\"apartment building\\" as the most logical and suitable answer.

They first fly to Oyster Bay, New York, on Long Island, to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes (De Niro), her mother Dina (Danner) and one-year-old nephew Little Jack (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of football. Meanwhile Pam informs Greg that she's pregnant, and the two decide to keep it secret from Jack. Jack again becomes suspicious of Greg's integrity and quality, when they are introduced to the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), with whom Bernie reveals Greg had a sexual affair fifteen years before. Jack later takes the RV to Isabel's fifteen-year-old son, Jorge (Ray Santiago), to fix the toilet, but is disturbed by Jorge's striking resemblance to Greg, and the fact that Jorge never met his father, and begins to suspect he may be Greg's son with Isabel.

The question asks about a scenario in which a person's death is unwanted by them. The options provided include cyanide, love, burial, suicide, and murder. Step 2: Analyze each option in regard to the main question. - Cyanide: A poisonous substance often used to cause death. If someone consumes cyanide (intentionally or accidentally) and dies, it may be unwanted by the person who has died. - Love: In this context, love does not directly result in an unwanted death, as it is an emotional feeling rather than an action. - Burial: Although a necessary process following a person's death, a burial itself is not the cause of the unwanted death. - Suicide: In the case of suicide, an individual intentionally causes their own death. Hence, the death in this case was wanted, at least at the moment of taking the action, by the person who died. - Murder: This option entails the unlawful killing of another person. As it is an act committed by someone else, the victim's death is often unwanted by the person who has died. Step 3: Select the best answer based on the analysis of each option. In the context of the main question, the best answer would be murder. This is because it involves the unlawful and intentional killing of someone by another person, which is most likely an unwanted scenario for the person facing death."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

The League Two side has been proactive in acquiring fresh talent as they aim to strengthen their squad and improve their chances in the league table standings. Danny Ward, a 27-year-old Welsh goalkeeper, has been plying his trade in the Liverpool setup since joining the club in 2012. Although he has not played as many minutes as he would have liked in the Premier League due to the presence of Alisson Becker and Loris Karius, Ward is recognized for his swift reflexes and his ability to command the 18-yard box effectively. Moreover, during his time at Liverpool, Ward has taken in loan spells at various clubs, including Aberdeen, Huddersfield Town, and now, Morecambe. While at Huddersfield, Ward played a crucial role in the club's promotion to the Premier League in the 2016-17 season after successfully saving two penalty shootouts in the playoffs. This experience will be invaluable for Morecambe, as they hope to climb the ranks in League Two. Aaron Wildig, on the other hand, is a 28-year-old English midfielder who started his career in the youth ranks of Cardiff City in 2009. Wildig later joined Shrewsbury Town in 2014 after a stint with Wolverhampton Wanderers. Wildig is known for his physicality, balance, and vision in the center of midfield, as well as his ability to contribute offensively with goals and assists. Morecambe's manager, Derek Adams, expressed his excitement about the new signings, stating, \\"We're thrilled to have Danny and Aaron join our squad on loan. They're both talented players with experience at higher levels of football. We believe that they will significantly raise the quality of our team and help us push forward in our campaign.\\" Indeed, Morecambe's ambition to climb the league table is evident, as they currently sit in 14th place, 10 points adrift from the playoff spots. The addition of Ward and Wildig is expected to provide the necessary depth and quality to enhance the team's overall performance. However, these deals also reveal the challenges that lower league clubs face in the competitive football landscape. Acquiring players on loan for short-term periods is often the only viable solution for smaller clubs, who lack the financial resources to secure permanent transfers. Morecambe's recent signings of Ward and Wildig highlight this reality of lower league football. The loan signings of Danny Ward and Aaron Wildig are expected to pay immediate dividends for Morecambe, with the players likely to make their debuts in the forthcoming fixture against Exeter City at the Globe Arena. As the League Two side looks to climb the table, Morecambe's fans, management, and players are optimistic that these loan signings will prove to be the catalysts that spur the club on to achieve greater heights on the football pitch. In conclusion, Morecambe's decision to sign Danny Ward and Aaron Wildig on one-month loan deals should be applauded, as the club continues to work strategically to improve their squad. These signings showcase the club's ambition to strengthen their team, compete at higher levels, and make their mark in League Two. It is crucial now for supporters, players, and staff to rally behind these new additions and to create an environment in which the entire team can thrive and achieve success."},{"question":"Write a sentence based on \\"boeing hires a legal team to handle scandal cases\\"","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subject and action The main subject of the sentence is \\"Boeing\\" and the action is \\"hiring a legal team.\\" Step 2: Determine additional information The purpose of hiring the legal team is to handle the scandal cases.

(2) His move put him directly in my path., does the word move mean the same thing?","response":"In these two sentences, the word \\"move\\" is used with a similar underlying concept but with slight differences in meaning and context. In both sentences, \\"move\\" denotes some form of motion or change in position, but the application of the word varies based on the specific context within each sentence. 1. A slight move of the tiller, and the boat will go off course. In this first sentence, \\"move\\" refers to the physical action of altering the position of the tiller, which is a lever used to control the direction of a boat. This context emphasizes the precise adjustment that causes a change in the boat's course. Here, 'move' suggests a deliberate and controlled action that directly influences the boat's navigation. The focus is on the small, subtle shift that has a significant impact on the boat's direction. 2. His move put him directly in my path. In the second sentence, \\"move\\" is used to describe the way someone changed their position, resulting in them being directly in the speaker's path. The motion might be voluntary or involuntary, and could involve walking, running, or any other means of changing location. In this case, 'move' implies a broader, less-defined action that led to that person's presence in the speaker's way. The focus here is on the result (being in someone's path) rather than the specifics of the motion itself. While \\"move\\" in both sentences pertains to an alteration or change in position, the first sentence emphasizes a precise, controlled action with direct consequences on the boat's course, while the second sentence addresses a broader sense of motion, focusing more on the outcome rather than the details of the action itself. In summary, the word \\"move\\" doesn't mean exactly the same thing in both sentences, as it carries contextual differences based on the situations presented. However, the underlying concept of change or alteration in position is present in both cases, connecting the two seemingly different meanings."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. The corporation's current HQ in Llandaff will shut and staff will relocate to a new building in Central Square in 2018. BBC Cymru Wales director Rhodri Talfan Davies said the location was a chance to be closer to audiences. The ageing infrastructure of the current HQ is the reason for the move. The new 150,000 sq ft (13,936 sq m) building relies upon the wider Capital Square development around Cardiff Central train station to progress as planned. The Capital Square project, to be delivered by Rightacres Property, include proposals to relocate the bus station. As well housing the existing BBC staff and services based at Llandaff, S4C has announced in principle that it plans to share some broadcasting services with the BBC at the new centre.

With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Ticino , formally the Republic and Canton of Ticino (; ; see also in other languages) is the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Ticino borders the Canton of Uri to the north, Valais to the west (through the Novena Pass), Graubünden to the northeast, Italy's regions of Piedmont and Lombardy to the south and it surrounds the small Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.

INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world.

Some have defined two general meanings according to its involvement of students. The first refers to education that transcends national borders by the exchange of people, for example, by students travelling to study at an international branch campus, as part of a study abroad program or as part of a student exchange program. The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world. - Lugano is a city in southern Switzerland in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino bordering Italy.

Letty Strong was raised in a good family, but became pregnant and ran away from home. She was taken in by elderly Fuzzy, and gave birth to Mickey in the back room of Fuzzy's bookstore at the age of fifteen. Embittered, she taught Mickey to be street smart so he will never be taken advantage of like her. Fuzzy strongly disapproves of how she is raising her son.

They get Mickey to lie about the extent of his injuries. However, during the trial, Mal's attorney produces films showing Mickey fully recovered. The irate judge has Mickey taken from Letty and put in an institution for boys. Mal and his wife Alyce have no children. Mal offers to adopt Mickey, with Letty's approval, so she can see her son more frequently. Mickey thrives on Mal's country estate and the loving parenting he receives.

(CNN) -- When I became one of Bill Clinton's earliest and chief accusers for the sexual harassment charges against him, two things were eminently true about my motives: (a) I did not become an accuser because Bill Clinton was a Democrat and I was a Republican, I didn't care one whit what the partisan fallout would be; and (b) I spoke out because the charges were plentiful enough and serious enough (I repeat, charges, not facts) to degrade not only all of our politics but all of our country, and because there are certain codes of honor, written and unwritten, for all men, Democrat and Republican. Indeed I wrote a book on this, laying it out, even before we knew the full extent of Bill Clinton's lies. For we who led the charge against","response":"Bill Clinton, our actions were fueled by a commitment to justice, truth, and the integrity of the political system in the United States. We believed that it was our responsibility to hold high-ranking public officials accountable for their actions, regardless of their political affiliations or the potential consequences for our own political careers. In coming forward and sharing our concerns about the allegations of sexual misconduct, we sought to ensure that the voices of the victims were heard and given the attention they deserved amidst the chaos and frenzy of the media and political landscape. Our focus was on addressing a culture of silence and complicity that had enabled such abuses of power to continue, unchecked, for far too long. The debate that ensued as a result of our efforts was not simply a battle between Democrats and Republicans, but a broader examination of the expectations and standards we have for our leaders and the consequences of their failure to adhere to these principles. As we delved further into the allegations, we uncovered a pattern of deceit and betrayal that extended well beyond the confines of the Oval Office, raising important questions about the underlying values and ethics that guide our country's political system. As our investigation into the accusations against Bill Clinton continued, we were confronted with a number of obstacles and challenges, from accusations of partisanship and bias, to threats to our personal and professional well-being. However, through perseverance and dedication to the pursuit of truth, we eventually succeeded in bringing these issues to light and prompting a much-needed conversation about the role that power, influence, and corruption play in American politics. In the years that have followed, our actions have served as a catalyst for greater scrutiny and accountability in the political realm, with recent movements like the #MeToo campaign shining a spotlight on harassment and abuse in various industries, including politics. While the road to change is long and fraught with obstacles, we remain committed to fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and respect in our nation's political landscape. In conclusion, when we chose to stand up against Bill Clinton in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds and vicious personal attacks, we did so not out of political motivations or personal vendettas, but out of a genuine belief in justice and the sanctity of our democratic system. As history has shown, our choice to speak out was not only valid, but crucial in exposing the truth and effecting change on a national scale. Ultimately, we hope that our efforts will serve as a reminder that irrespective of one's political allegiance, some principles—such as honor, integrity, and the pursuit of justice—are universal and should always come first."},{"question":"Definition: Given a sentence in Arabic, generate a new Arabic sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Translate to English","response":"According to the data from the Ministry of Transport, the number of passengers increased by 13% last year compared to 2003, while the number of trips recorded an increase of 18%. Based on the information provided by the Ministry of Transport, it is evident that there has been a significant surge in transportation usage in recent years. The number of passengers utilizing various means of transportation rose by 13% last year, in comparison to the recorded figures from 2003. This increase can be attributed to several factors, such as population growth, economic development, and improvements in transport infrastructure. Moreover, the number of trips undertaken also experienced an 18% increase, suggesting that not only are more people using transport services, but they are also using them more frequently. This growth in transportation demand can place additional strain on existing infrastructure and may necessitate further investment to accommodate the increasing number of passengers and services. The improvement in transport infrastructure could be a result of substantial investment in public transportation, road networks, and railway systems by the government in recent times. As well-organized and efficient transportation networks are crucial for sustaining economic growth and ensuring a high quality of life for citizens, it is vital that the Ministry of Transport continues to monitor and analyze trends in passenger numbers and trip frequency to better anticipate future needs. Population growth also plays an essential role in the upswing in transportation usage. As the population increases, so does the demand for accessible and efficient transport systems. Urbanization may also contribute to such trends, as more people migrate to urban areas, where transportation options are more readily available, such as buses, trams, and subways. Furthermore, economic development can lead to a rise in disposable income among citizens, allowing them to afford more frequent trips. Such developments can result in increased demand for transportation, particularly in the private sector, with more people opting to purchase vehicles for personal use. In conclusion, the Ministry of Transport's data highlighting a 13% increase in passenger numbers and an 18% increase in trips compared to 2003 underscores the rapid growth in transportation demand in recent years. A combination of factors, including population growth, economic development, and investment in infrastructure, likely contributed to these trends. Regulations and further investments in transportation infrastructure will be necessary to respond to these changes effectively and to ensure sustainable growth in the sector."},{"question":"Question.

A law enforcement official familiar with the incident but not authorized to talk about it, said Corkins asked to see someone Johnson didn’t know. Johnson has worked at the Council for 11 years and became suspicious. Corkins said he had the name in his bag, bent down and pulled out a 9mm handgun, the official said. Corkins said “I don’t like your politics,” according to the FBI affifavit. He then shot at Johnson, the affidavit said, and hit him in the arm. Johnson, wounded, wrestled the gun away and subdued Corkins, the affifavit said. If convicted, Corkins could face prison sentences of up to 10 years on the federal firearms charge and up to 30 on the District of Columbia assault charge. At Thursday’s hearing, Corkins appeared in white prison jumpsuit, walking into the courtroom quietly between two U.S. Marshals over which he towered. As Kay outlined the charges against him, he stood twirling his thumbs with his hands behind his back. Kay asked Corkins whether he had enough money to pay for an attorney; he said he did not. “I have about 300,” Corkins said in a soft, clear voice. In a Thursday morning interview, Leonardo Johnson’s mother said she was proud of her son for subduing the gunman and “so happy” to hear the District’s police chief call him a hero. “I’m sorry for what happened, and the way he got hurt,” Virginia Johnson said by telephone from her Southeast home. She spoke with her son, when he called from a hospital moments after she saw news of the shooting on television newscasts. “Yes, I’d say he was a hero,” said Virginia Johnson, 72. D.C.

He was trying to calm me down.” Johnson said her son, who also lives in Southeast, didn’t provide many details of the incident. “He just told me, ‘Ma, I got shot.’ I said ‘I figured it was you.’ I said, ‘Where did you get shot at?’ He said ‘In the arm.’”","response":"Floyd Lee Corkins has been charged in connection with the shooting at the Family Research Council headquarters.

A barbershop quartet is a type of musical ensemble typically comprised of four singers, usually all male, who sing in four-part harmony. The parts are named Lead, Tenor, Baritone and Bass. The Lead usually sings the melody, with the Tenor harmonizing above the melody, the Bass singing the lowest harmonizing notes, and the Baritone completing the chord. The term \\"barbershop\\" originated from the common practice of harmonized singing in barbershops in the United States in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. During this time, it was common for men to gather at barbershops to socialize and to engage in communal singing. Singing in close harmony, or \\"barbershop style,\\" was a popular pastime during this era. The barbershop was not the only place where this type of singing took place, but it was a common , non-structured gathering place for men where they could enjoy each other's company and spend their free time. The term \\"quartet\\", of course, refers to the number of individuals in the group -- the quartet -- each of whom would sing a different voice part. The idea of a quartet was not new and had been utilized in various forms of music such as classical music long before it was adopted into what we know today as the barbershop quartet. The songs sung by these quartets were usually folk songs or popular tunes of the time, also known as \\"barbershop tunes\\". These songs had simple melodies and were easily adapted to four-part harmony. Since the modern key-center style of arranging was not used back then, singers used their ears to create parts that sounded good to them. The origins of the barbershop quartet can also be traced back to the African-American community, who sang spirituals, folk songs, and popular songs in four-part harmony, switching lead between voices, typically on the street corners, or in—you guessed it—barbershops. The barbershop style regained popularity in the 1930s, when a tax lawyer named Rupert I. Hall, along with several other men, formed the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America, known today as the Barbershop Harmony Society. Overall, this style of music has its roots firmly planted in the United States and holds a special place in American musical history, uniting different cultural influences and evolving over time while keeping that unique sense of harmony and camaraderie. By understanding its origins, we appreciate it even more and keep the tradition alive for future generations to enjoy."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

Unbeknownst to the villagers, Pierre has been hiding a dark secret that only Thomas is aware of. As Thomas threatens to expose Pierre's hidden past, the mayor starts to unravel and must do whatever it takes to protect his reputation and position in Saint-Luc. Act 1: Pierre Amsler is adored and respected by the villagers as their long-serving mayor. The village of Saint-Luc prepares for its annual harvest festival, an event that Pierre has flawlessly organized for many years. As the festivities draw near, Pierre begins to feel the pressure of maintaining his near-perfect performance as mayor. Enters Thomas, a mysterious and enigmatic figure who seems to take a keen interest in Pierre and his work. Pierre, weary of Thomas, maintains his composure and focuses on organizing the harvest festival. Act 2: Thomas ingratiates himself into the village and starts to gain the trust of its inhabitants, including Pierre's wife Marie and their two children. Pierre becomes increasingly anxious and disturbed by Thomas's presence, suspecting that Thomas has ulterior motives. One evening, Thomas confronts Pierre and reveals that he knows about a terrible secret from Pierre's past. As a young man, Pierre was involved in a scandal involving embezzlement and the death of an old man. Pierre had tried to cover up this dark event, relocating to Saint-Luc, where he rebuilt his life and found redemption in public service.

However, his efforts prove fruitless, as Thomas has covered his tracks well. The situation worsens when Thomas shares the mayor's secret to some influential villagers, who demand Pierre's immediate resignation. Pierre is forced to accept Thomas's demands and relinquish control of the harvest festival. The climax sees Pierre devising a plan to neutralize Thomas's grip over the village. He gathers evidence of Thomas's manipulation of Saint-Luc's finances during the festival and turns the tables on him by threatening to go public. In the final act, Pierre confronts Thomas, armed with the evidence stacked against him, forcing Thomas to pack up his bags and leave the village. The villagers, who have come to understand and empathize with their mayor's past mistakes, rally behind Pierre, banishing Thomas from Saint-Luc forever. Despite the hardships, Pierre grows stronger as a result, vowing to remain transparent with his beloved community and devoted to his duties as the mayor of Saint-Luc. The film concludes with a heartwarming scene of Pierre surrounded by his loving family and the supportive villagers who pledge their loyalty to him, demonstrating the power of forgiveness and redemption."},{"question":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

Faulconer had 54.5 percent compared to Alvarez’s 45.5 percent of the vote with all precincts reporting. A Faulconer victory breathes new life into the local Republican Party by restoring its control of the Mayor’s Office that its candidates have occupied for much of the past four decades. Faulconer also becomes the only Republican mayor of a top 10 U.S. city, making him one of the party’s highest-profile leaders in the state. The results dashed the hopes of Alvarez to become San Diego’s first Latino mayor and its youngest in nearly 120 years. It also blunted a push by Democrats to have a like-minded mayor join the party’s 5-4 majority on the City Council to shepherd a new era of progressive politics for America’s Finest City. The runoff election will fill the vacancy left by Democrat Bob Filner’s Aug. 30 resignation stemming from a sexual harassment scandal. Faulconer will finish the remaining 33 months on Filner’s term and be up for re-election in 2016.

Faulconer added, “And so tonight our message to every single San Diego neighborhood: We will invest where we need to help, we will get our city back on track on the services that San Diegans expect and that they deserve.” Mayoral candidate David Alvarez addresses Supporters during his election night party at the San Diego Public Market, alongside his wife Xochitl Alvarez and daughter Izel Alvarez.

Assembly member Toni Atkins (2nd R) and Interim Mayor Todd Gloria (R) join them onstage. — John Gastaldo Alvarez spoke to his supporters around 10:15 p.m. thanking them for their hard work on his campaign and remained optimistic despite the poor showing. “While there are still votes to be counted tonight — the night is young — one thing is for certain: we are here, poised to move our city forward because of every single one of you here,” he said. Alvarez later told U-T San Diego that the issues confronting the city won’t change, regardless of the election results. “We still have a lot of work ahead regardless of the outcome,” he said. “I look forward to that as mayor or as a member of the council.” He later said on Twitter that he called Faulconer and conceded the election. “I want to congratulate Kevin Faulconer. It’s clear that he will be the next mayor of San Diego. I look forward to working with him,” he wrote. Faulconer responded to Alvarez via Twitter: \\"Thank you for a respectful campaign. As mayor, I look forward to working with you to move our city forward.\\" Conventional wisdom held that Faulconer would have a lead among the mail ballots collected before Election Day, but the 13-point edge he held at 8 p.m. when those results were released was much larger than most pundits expected. An early advantage for Faulconer was anticipated because Republican-leaning voters have historically been consistent and reliable voters in most elections, especially in special ones. ||||| SAN DIEGO -- Republican Councilman Kevin Faulconer defeated Democratic Councilman David Alvarez, 54.5% to 45.5%, to become the city's next mayor, according to unofficial results tallied by the county registrar of voters.

Alvarez, 33, said he called Faulconer to offer his congratulations and say that he looks forward to working with the new mayor. If elected, Alvarez would have been the youngest and first Latino mayor in modern San Diego history. Faulconer, a former public relations executive before entering politics, promised that he and Alvarez will work together \\"to move our city forward.\\" Acting Mayor Todd Gloria, a Democrat who endorsed Alvarez, praised the Alvarez campaign: \\"Son of a janitor and fast-food worker; his story is proof that anything is possible in San Diego.\\" Faulconer, 47, told cheering supporters Tuesday night that he \\"can't wait to be the next mayor of this fabulous and great city.\\" He also allowed himself a not-so-veiled reference to the now-passed era of ex-Mayor Bob Filner, who resigned Aug. 31 after months of a chaotic management style at City Hall followed by multiple accusations of sexual harassment. \\"This city has gone through a lot in the last year, but we knew that as San Diegans we were better than that,\\" Faulconer said. Faulconer is to be sworn in March 3 to serve the final 33 months of Filner's term. Filner, 71, was the city's first Democratic mayor in two decades.

Hypothesis: The woman is hispanic. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","response":"From the premise provided, we cannot definitively conclude if the hypothesis is true. The information given in the premise: \\"A blond woman leans against a white fence\\" in no way provides explicit information about the woman's ethnic or racial background which includes being Hispanic. The character's hair color, blond, and the action of her leaning against a white fence, do not specifically indicate her ethnicity. Hispanic individuals can indeed have a variety of hair colors, including blond, due to genetic diversity and other factors like hair dye. However, hair color alone is not a reliable indicator of someone's ethnicity. Additionally, the premise doesn't provide information about the woman's physical characteristics such as facial features, skin complexion, or other specific details that might, to a certain degree, suggest a particular ethnic background. Even with such characteristics, it would still be an assumption rather than a definite determination since such attributes can occur in several ethnic backgrounds. To validate the hypothesis, we would need additional information or context about the woman’s heritage, language, culture, birthplace, or family history. While racial and ethnic identity can be complex and multifaceted, encompassing more than just physical appearance, usually such a designation is tied to some combination of geographic origin, culture, language, and patterns of family migration. Therefore, based on the premise, we cannot conclusively determine that the woman is Hispanic. Conclusively affirming the hypothesis based on this limited premise could lead to stereotyping or misrepresentation.

The colorful puzzle has gone on to become the world's biggest selling toy -- with 350 million sold. Hungarian-born Rubik retraces the moment of inspiration that led him to his iconic invention. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Ernő Rubik: The Mastermind Behind the World's Best-Selling Toy Introduction Ernő Rubik, a Hungarian professor and architect, is the mastermind behind the Rubik's Cube, the world's largest selling toy. Boasting sales of over 350 million, the Rubik's Cube has become a cultural icon and a beloved puzzle across generations worldwide. Born from humble beginnings as a teaching aid in his classroom, the cube has gone on to inspire countless marvel at the simplicity and complexity of its design. Here, we delve into the story of Rubik's moment of inspiration and how it led to the creation of one of the most universally recognized toys in history. The Beginning In the early 1970s, Ernő Rubik was teaching architecture and design at the Budapest College of Applied Arts. While trying to find a compelling method to convey geometry and spacial concepts to his students, Rubik sought to create a tangible and interactive model that would enable them to visualize how three-dimensional objects could move in relation to one another. Amidst his search for inspiration, Rubik stumbled upon the initial spark that would eventually become the Rubik's Cube. The Moment of Inspiration According to Ernő Rubik himself, the eureka moment that led to the invention of the Rubik's Cube was when he was attempting to design a structure with moving parts that could rotate without falling apart. He soon discovered that the solution lay in the use of a 'core' mechanism that allowed individual blocks to twist and rotate around a central axis without disassembling the overall structure. Armed with this breakthrough in design, Rubik created the prototype of what would become the Rubik's Cube - a cube composed of 27 smaller cubes, with 3x3 layers that could be individually manipulated along the X, Y, or Z axis. This early prototype was made using simple wooden blocks and rubber bands, in stark contrast to the colorful plastic models we recognize today. From Teaching Aid to Global Sensation Upon completion of the prototype, Rubik introduced the cube to his students as an interactive teaching aid for understanding complex geometry. However, it quickly became apparent that the cube had laid the foundation for a puzzle that demanded creativity and logical thinking to solve. Realizing the potential of his invention, Rubik applied for a patent in 1975 and soon entered the world of mass production. Initially known as the \\"Magic Cube\\", this latest addition to the toy market eventually emerged onto the global stage under the name \\"Rubik's Cube\\" in 1980. Consequently, the popularity of the cube exploded, reaching a staggering 100 million units sold within the first two years. A Lasting Legacy More than four decades after its inception, the Rubik's Cube continues to be an emblematic figure in popular culture. Its simple yet challenging design has encouraged millions of people worldwide to engage in problem-solving and creativity. The cube has also given rise to various related inventions such as the 4x4 Rubik's Revenge, the 5x5 Professor's Cube, and countless speedcubing competitions. In Conclusion Ernő Rubik's journey of discovery, from searching for a teaching aid in his classroom to inventing a globally celebrated symbol of intellectual curiosity, truly epitomizes the power of innovation and creativity. The Rubik's Cube, a vibrant and complex puzzle, is a testament to the human mind's pursuit of challenge and understanding. With continuous sales and a deeply entrenched presence in popular culture, the Rubik's Cube stands as an enduring icon that transcends generations and invites us all to experience the joy of solving the world's best-selling toy."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a context, a question, three options, and an answer.

These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court! Now, I have a new situation: Two six graders learned about the lives of animals.

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Pseudemoia is a genus of skinks native to southeastern Australia. For similar skinks see genera \\"Bassiana\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and \\"Niveoscincus\\". - Leiolopisma is a genus of skinks. Most species occur in the region of New Caledonia-New Zealand, and they are related to other genera from that general area, such as \\"Emoia\\"; these and others form the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. One living and two extinct taxa represent a clade endemic to the Mascarenes.(Austin & Arnold 2006) - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Eugongylus is a genus of skinks in the subfamily Lygosominae. The namesake of the \\"Eugonglyus\\" group of genera, it occupies a quite basal position among these. Members of this genus are commonly called mastiff skinks or short-legged giant skinks. - Oligosoma is a genus of small to medium-sized skinks (family Scincidae) found only in New Zealand as well as Norfolk and Lord Howe islands. \\"Oligosoma\\" belongs to the \\"Eugongylus\\" group of genera in the subfamily Lygosominae; the genus \\"Bassiana\\" appears to be fairly closely related. - For ancient Roman town in the territory of present - day Serbia , see : Bassianae . Bassiana is a genus of skinks ( family Scincidae ) . It belongs to the Eugongylus group ; the genus Oligosoma appears to be a fairly close relative . An alternative name is Acritoscincus . For similar skinks see genera Pseudemoia , Lampropholis , and Niveoscincus . - Niveoscincus is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae), commonly called snow skinks or cool-skinks and residing mainly in Tasmania or Victoria, Australia. The genus \\"Niveoscincus\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Carlia\\", \\"Lampropholis\\" and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. For similar skinks see genera \\"Pseudemoia\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and \\"Bassiana\\". These skinks have adapted to the cooler weather of southern Australia and particularly Tasmania, hence the common names. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Skinks are lizards belonging to the family Scincidae and the infraorder Scincomorpha. With more than 1,500 described species, the Scincidae is one of the most diverse families of lizards. - Lygosominae is the largest subfamily of skinks in the family Scincidae. The subfamily can be divided into a number of genus groups. If the rarely used taxonomic rank of infrafamily is employed, the genus groups would be designated as such, but such a move would require a formal description according to the ICZN standards. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Lampropholis, the Indo-Australian ground skinks or sunskinks, are a genus of skinks in the lizard subfamily Lygosominae. The genus \\"Lampropholis\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Niveoscincus\\", \\"Leiolopisma\\" and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. They are found mainly in Indonesia and Australia. For similar skinks see genera \\"Bassiana\\", \\"Pseudemoia\\", and \\"Niveoscincus\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Carlia is a genus of skinks, commonly known as four-fingered skinks, in the subfamily Lygosominae. \\"Carlia\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Niveoscincus\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. What is the relationship between 'bassiana' and 'lygosominae'?","response":"Bassiana is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae) and belongs to the Eugongylus group. The genus Oligosoma appears to be a fairly close relative. Bassiana is related to other genera such as Pseudemoia, Lampropholis, and Niveoscincus. On the other hand, Lygosominae is the largest subfamily of skinks in the family Scincidae, which can be divided into several genus groups, including the Eugongylus group. Therefore, the relationship between Bassiana and Lygosominae is that Bassiana is a genus of skinks within the Lygosominae subfamily and is part of the Eugongylus group."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

A Florida teacher who had a four month affair with an underage student and aborted his child left her previous job after being investigated for another inappropriate relationship with a teen boy. Jennifer Fichter was said to have been infatuated with the eighth grade student and was suspended from her job while an investigation was launched in 2008. A 40 page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him. She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’ Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night. When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’ The report said Fichte and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed. Fichter resigned from Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in the fall of 2008 after administrators suspended her. Scroll down for video. Fichter had reportedly told another teacher that a 14-year-old student 'makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes' An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy.

The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'. Police said the mum confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter. The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long. Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck. The mother also agreed to speak to Fichter and record the conversation for investigators. During the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the teen's child and had an abortion.

It does not, however, specifically address the parliament in Berlin. To answer the question, \\"The parliament in Berlin is called what?\\" we need to focus on the legislative branch of Berlin, which is specifically responsible for creating and modifying laws. In Berlin, the city-state's parliament is referred to as the \\"Abgeordnetenhaus,\\" sometimes translated as the House of Representatives or the House of Deputies in English. The Abgeordnetenhaus is a unicameral legislative body, meaning it only has one chamber, and it is composed of elected representatives from various political parties. The Abgeordnetenhaus has several functions, including: 1. Passing and amending laws: The parliament is responsible for creating and modifying the legal framework in Berlin, taking into consideration the interests and needs of its constituents. 2. Representation and deliberation: The elected representatives in the Abgeordnetenhaus ensure that diverse perspectives and political interests are represented in the decision-making process. 3. Oversight: The Abgeordnetenhaus holds the executive branch, the Senate, accountable for its actions. By questioning and scrutinizing the executive branch's decisions, the parliament maintains a system of checks and balances. 4. Budget approval: The parliament discusses and approves the annual budget, which outlines the funding for different policy areas and public services. In conclusion, although the statement touches upon the governments of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg being designated as Senates, it does not provide the correct answer to the question of what the parliament in Berlin is called. Instead, the correct answer is \\"Abgeordnetenhaus,\\" a legislative body responsible for various functions, including law-making, representation, oversight, and budget approval."},{"question":"Question: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

That, after all, is what it means to be an establishment. But not always. Three of the last six presidents—Jimmy Carter in 1976, Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Barack Obama in 2008—ran against their own party’s powerbrokers, captured the nomination, and then took the Oval Office from an incumbent president (1976, 1980) or an incumbent party (2008). True, establishment candidates have more often beaten back insurgents. But that hasn’t always turned out so well for their party. Gerald Ford lost the general election in 1976, Jimmy Carter (who had held off challenger Ted Kennedy for the Democratic nomination) lost in 1980, Walter Mondale lost in 1984, Bob Dole lost in 1996, John Kerry lost in 2004, and John McCain (who’d gone from insurgent in 2000 to quasi-establishment candidate eight years later) lost in 2008. In 2000, the two establishment candidates won their nominations, and both arguably underperformed in the fall. Al Gore managed to lose as an incumbent vice president running in a time of peace and prosperity; George W. Bush frittered away a substantial lead by succumbing to establishmentarian complacency and following the counsel of advisers that the way to win was to don the mantle of inevitability. (He was saved by Ralph Nader voters in Florida.) Mitt Romney, this year’s iteration of the establishment candidate, is a decent, serious, and in some ways impressive man. But it’s clear a lot of Republicans look at him, his campaign, and his advocates and see the ghosts of establishmentarians past. The question in this cycle has always been whether a viable challenger would emerge. We will now see, in the crucible of an intense campaign, whether Rick Santorum is up to the task of being that challenger. And we will also see whether the establishment will be able to put so heavy a thumb on the scales that voters will think the race is over before it has even really begun. ||||| Not long ago few thought Mitt Romney could win both the very conservative Iowa caucuses and then the quirky, slightly contrarian New Hampshire primary. If he did, most assumed he would have a lock on the Republican nomination. For understandable reasons: No other GOP presidential candidate in an open race has achieved back-to-back victories in these first two contests. By this time next week, we'll know if Mr. Romney is 2-0. If so, he becomes the prohibitive favorite. Enlarge Image Close Associated Press Mitt Romney greeting supporters at his caucus night rally in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday. The other big Iowa winner is former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Iowa does winnow the field (as it did with Wednesday's departure of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann). But it also gives unheralded contenders like Mr. Santorum a chance to jump into the spotlight. And in spectacular fashion, he did. He essentially tied the GOP front-runner, leap-frogging the governor of the second-largest state (Rick Perry) and the former speaker of the House (Newt Gingrich). Mr. Santorum shouldn't kid himself; he faces huge obstacles. He's spent a year making Iowa his second home. Now he's in less friendly, less familiar terrain. He hasn't had to endure withering scrutiny but will shortly. His chief opponent has tremendous organizational and financial advantages and has been through the rigors of a presidential primary race. Still, Mr. Santorum has a shot, and that's all he could have hoped for. Looking ahead, he has to hope New Hampshire pays attention to what happens in Iowa (it traditionally hasn't) and that he can rapidly cobble together money, organization and a message to compete in January's primaries in South Carolina and Florida, as well as the Granite State. Until yesterday, Mr. Santorum hadn't been in New Hampshire in a month, South Carolina for two, and Florida hardly at all. Because he has a high floor of support but also a very low ceiling, Texas Congressman Ron Paul is likely to have seen his high-water mark Tuesday. The results provided him little that helps him broaden his support in New Hampshire and subsequent primaries. His manager admitted as much by saying they would focus on caucuses rather than the more numerous primaries, a strategy guaranteed to marginalize Mr. Paul as a candidate and maximize his convention influence. Despite a deeply disappointing fourth-place finish, Mr. Gingrich—who only a month ago held a double digit lead in Iowa—will go on, driven in part by his obvious bitterness toward Mr. Romney. This puts him dangerously close to looking \\"enraged, wearing a full hockey mask and carrying a chainsaw,\\" as one Washington observer put it. Mr. Gingrich can recover, but only if he returns to what made him the front-runner a month ago: coming off as the best-informed debater and offering a wide-ranging vision. Mr. Perry says he'll continue and focus on South Carolina. But if spending 5.5 million in Iowa on television (roughly 430 a vote) didn't work, the 3 million or 4 million he has left in his war chest may not change his fortunes down South. At least it gives him the right to try. This leaves Mr. Romney facing a two-front war: one in New Hampshire against Messrs. Santorum, Gingrich, Paul and former Amb. Jon Huntsman, and a second one in South Carolina against Messrs. Santorum, Gingrich, Paul and Perry. His deep organization and large treasury are critical to weathering assaults from these gentlemen. The former Massachusetts governor should prepare to be the piñata at Saturday's debate in Manchester, N.H. It won't be pleasant, but he can solidify his lead if he deflects the attacks in a dignified, confident manner and avoids looking irritated or rattled. As in earlier debates, better to look amused rather than annoyed. Wherever possible, Mr. Romney should focus his fire on substantive disagreements with Mr. Obama while demonstrating his readiness to embrace bold reform (as he did in his entitlement reform speech endorsing the thrust of Rep. Paul Ryan's budget). Easier said than done. If a year ago you said that Mitt Romney would win Iowa, be heading to New Hampshire with a large lead, and his chief opponent would be a former senator who lost his re-election race in a swing state by 18 points, you would have had to believe Mr. Romney would be on his way to winning the GOP nomination. And you know what? Now we'll see if it plays out that way. Mr. Rove is the former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush. |||||Summary:","response":"This article talks about how sometimes people who are not part of the \\"establishment\\" can become president, like Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama.

It is a versatile breed developed in the late 19th century by crossing Merino and Lincoln sheep. The Corriedale breed was specifically created to meet the demand for high-quality wool and meat, suitable for various climates and farming systems. Today, it is a popular breed in many countries, valued for its versatility and consistent performance. Physical Characteristics: Corriedale sheep are medium to large-sized animals, known for their distinctive appearance. They have a robust and compact body structure with a broad, well-defined back and deep chest. The body is covered with a fleece that typically consists of fine to medium-grade wool. The wool is soft, lustrous, and highly sought after in textile production. Both rams (male sheep) and ewes (female sheep) have a clear, open face free from wool, and distinctive curled horns. Rams usually have larger horns than ewes, and some ewes may have smaller horns or none at all. Corriedale sheep have strong, well-placed legs with black hooves that resist cracking and splitting. Wool Production: One of the primary reasons for breeding Corriedale sheep is their high-quality wool production. Their wool is dense, uniform, and relatively long-stapled, usually measuring around 25 to 30 microns in diameter. An adult Corriedale sheep can produce between 10 to 17 pounds of wool per year. The wool is suitable for various uses, including worsted suitings, knitwear, blankets, and upholstery. The natural shades of Corriedale wool range from white to light gray or even shades of moorit (a brown color). Its versatility and resilience make it an ideal choice for hand-spinning and felting projects. Meat Production: Besides being excellent wool producers, Corriedale sheep are also known for their meat production. Their meat is tender and flavorful, with a good yield of lean meat compared to body fat. Corriedales reach maturity at a relatively young age and are fertile, which contributes to their value as meat animals. Their fast growth rate and excellent feed conversion ratio make them an efficient option for farmers interested in raising sheep for meat. Adaptability: Corriedale sheep can adapt to various environments and farming systems. They have a hardy constitution and are known for their disease resistance, making them suitable for both intensive farming practices and more extensive grazing systems. Corriedale sheep thrive in both hot and cold climates and can be found in countries worldwide, such as South America, North America, Europe, and Asia. Breeding and Lambing: Corriedale sheep are known for their high fertility rates and easy lambing. Ewes are known to be excellent mothers, and twins are not uncommon. Lambs are born with a good birth weight and grow rapidly, making them suitable for early weaning. The breed's overall good health and reproductive traits make it an attractive choice for farmers aiming to increase their flock size quickly. In conclusion, the Corriedale is a versatile and adaptable domestic sheep known for its high-quality wool and meat production. Its hardy constitution, disease resistance, and excellent breeding traits make it a popular choice for both small-scale homesteads and large commercial farms. The Corriedale's combination of valuable qualities ensures that it continues to be a desirable breed in the global sheep industry."},{"question":"- The pancreas creates juices that help digest food - The pancreas releases the juices into the stomach - Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein - Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood - The enzymes begin producing again.

By Mark Shand During my years as a conservationist, I have witnessed many shocking sights: elephants hacked to death for their ivory; rhinos butchered for the supposed healing properties of their horns; and tigers ensnared in vicious traps so that their body parts can be harvested as a cure for impotence in parts of China and South-East Asia. I thought I’d seen just about every example of man’s inhumanity to his fellow creatures. But even I was shocked by the news that Copenhagen Zoo has shot dead a perfectly healthy young giraffe named Marius. Not only shot him, but dissected his corpse in front of an audience of zoo visitors, including many young children. In a final insult, his dismembered body was fed to its resident pride of lions. There is no suggestion that","response":"Marius was suffering from any sort of disease or genetic abnormality that would have necessitated such a grim end. On the contrary, Marius was a healthy two-year-old, well-loved by the zoo-goers. The Copenhagen Zoo authorities, instead, stated that their main reason for putting Marius down was to prevent inbreeding. Yet, one must question whether the nature of his death was absolutely necessary or was it merely an exposition of human dominance and control? Surely, other alternatives could have been explored? There are more than 300 Zoos in Europe alone, many of which already host giraffes and perhaps could have offered Marius a home. I understand that within the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, a strategy for genetic diversity is vital to ensure the longevity of certain species. However, when considering the drastic measures taken in Marius' case, it is difficult to overlook the fact that the heightened notion of preserving genetics has allowed for the ethics of animal welfare to falter. Moreover, the fact that the dissection was performed in front of an audience, including children, accentuates the desensitization towards the sanctity of life. While educational opportunities and transparency in the face of nature's harsh realities are important, there must surely be a line dividing education from sensationalism. Performing such a dissection openly crossed that line into an unsettling display of indifference towards the life of a creature that, merely hours before, was alive and a source of joy for many visitors. Finally, feeding Marius to the lions, while reflecting the circle of life in the natural world, in this instance felt more like a final degradation. In the wild, death comes as a part of survival and the food chain. In the confines of a man-made environment such as a zoo, it shows a level of disdain towards the creatures that are supposed to be cared for and protected. In the end, Marius's fate is a jarring reminder of the paradoxical role zoos play in our society. They are institutions entrusted with the preservation and protection of endangered species, yet they also hold the power over life and death. It raises the ethical question of who should and who should not, survive in a world where survival is no longer purely down to natural selection, but increasingly mediated by human actions and decisions. This raises pivotal questions about our obligations towards our fellow creatures. It underlines the urgencies in re-evaluating our practices pertaining to animal conservation and our attitude towards nature's creations. It stresses the need for building empathy, fostering respect, and nurturing love for the animal kingdom in their right to life, to prevent such tragedies from repeating. Moving ahead, may Marius' unfortunate end serve as a heartbreaking reminder for us all to reassess how we interact with the natural world. Let it remind us that our role should be one of stewards, not executioners. Let it prompt zoos and conservation bodies worldwide to rethink their policies on euthanasia and their strategies in preserving genetic diversity. In a world grappling with loss of biodiversity and rising threats to wildlife, it is our duty to ensure that every effort to conserve doesn't end up causing harm to the very creatures we are striving to protect. Let's aim to strike a balance where human intervention supports wildlife survival without compromising on the welfare and dignity of individual animals."},{"question":"Question: Pick which sentence is not logical. Options: - Sentence A: \\"Sylvia writes email to her boss to report her work everyday\\" - Sentence B: \\"Sylvia writes email to her children to report her work everyday\\" Please answer this question gradually:","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, we need to consider the context in which a person would typically report their work. Step 1: Analyzing Sentence A - \\"Sylvia writes an email to her boss to report her work every day.\\" This sentence seems logical because it is common for employees to report their work progress or daily tasks to their supervisors or bosses. Regular communication with one's boss helps maintain transparency and ensures that both parties are on the same page concerning work-related matters. Step 2: Analyzing Sentence B - \\"Sylvia writes an email to her children to report her work every day.\\" This sentence appears less logical in the context of reporting work progress. Although it is possible for an individual to share their daily work accomplishments with family members, it's uncommon for someone to do this with their children on a daily basis, as they would not typically have a direct interest or involvement in the person's work.

The Honda S600, available as a roadster and a fastback coupé, was the first Honda automobile to be available in two trim levels. However, it is important to note that the Honda S600 is not the first car produced by Honda. Honda's venture into the automobile industry began with the production of the T360 mini pickup truck and the S500, a sports car, in 1963. The S500, which was the predecessor to the S600, was the first production car to be manufactured by Honda. The S500 was a small, two-seat open-top sports car, featuring a 531cc engine with a four-speed manual transmission. This model was only produced for two years, from 1963 to 1964, before being replaced by the S600. The S600, introduced in 1964, was an upgrade from the S500, featuring a more powerful 606cc engine and more sophisticated specifications. Its distinguishing features included a chain-driven rear-wheel-drive system and independent suspension on all four wheels. The roadster version had a strong resemblance to the earlier Honda S500, while the fastback coupé model, launched in March 1965, became a new offering from Honda. As the successor of the S500, the S600 was a breakthrough for Honda in the automotive market, as it showcased the brand's technical expertise and engineering capabilities. The production of the S600 continued until 1966, when it was replaced by the Honda S800. In conclusion, the answer you found on Google is correct in stating that the Honda S600 was the first Honda car available in two trim levels.

The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatan Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines. During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities. Nakbe in the Peten department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatan were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Peten by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi). Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC. In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocola were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatan.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims.

Step 2: Consider each option and try to justify or eliminate it based on its relevance to the question given. Option 1: Mouth - It is unlikely that farmers specifically keep toothpicks in their mouths at all times. Option 2: Grocery store - Toothpicks might be bought at a grocery store, but this does not answer where farmers keep them afterward. Option 3: Constructing models - This option seems unrelated to a farmer's occupation and the usage of toothpicks. Option 4: Shed - Farmers often have sheds to store various tools and supplies necessary for farming. It is possible that toothpicks could be stored here as well. Option 5: Box - A box is a general storage option suitable for holding small items like toothpicks. Step 3: Identify the most logical answer given the context of the question. The question asks where farmers keep toothpicks. Given the options provided, \\"shed\\" and \\"box\\" are the most relevant and closely related answers to the question.

Among the possible options provided, \\"higher intelligence\\" most closely aligns with this notion because it refers to a level of knowledge or understanding that goes beyond the typical human brain, implying a potentially superior or more advanced form of cognition. The other options can be evaluated as follows: 1. Culture: Although culture can shape beliefs and knowledge, it does not necessarily signify something beyond the human brain. 2. Inspiration: Inspiration may lead to new insights, but it does not inherently imply a higher form of intelligence. 3. Increasing knowledge: While increasing one's knowledge through studying might lead to a deeper understanding of various subjects, it does not directly correspond to the notion of something existing beyond man's brain. 4. Better grades: Better grades might indicate improved performance in a specific subject but is not directly connected to the idea of a higher intelligence beyond the human brain.

Each one is marked by its own distinct features. Which snail you choose may depend on your aesthetic preferences, your tank's needs, or both. Gold Inca snails are recognizable by their bright, yellow shells. Gold Inca snails are considered good cleaners of freshwater tanks, as they tend to consume algae and detritus. Ivory snails are identified by their cream-colored shells. Ivory snails are also considered good tank cleaners and \\"scavengers\\" of freshwater aquariums. Mystery snails have a shell that tends to vary in appearance, but is usually somewhat dark (though some are ivory), typically with brown accents or stripes. Mystery snails have a tendency to scavenge, but they can also easily escape tanks and will most likely require a secure lid. Nerite snails come in different shapes, colors, and patterns, depending on the variety of snail. Nerite snails tend to scavenge for algae, but they also burrow into the substrate at the bottom in search of food. Pond snails are one of the most frequently-encountered unwanted snails. Pond snails tend to travel on aquatic plants and in aquarium water, often inadvertently making their way home from the pet store to a new home. Ramshorn snails have a shell that appears to twist and curl, much like the horn on the head of a ram (hence the name). Ramshorn snails are good scavengers, but like pond snails they often end up in home aquariums by accident. Trumpet snails tend to have elongated and cone-shaped shells. Trumpet snails are excellent scavengers, but like pond snails and ramshorn snails, they often appear without invitation in new aquariums due to their ability to sneak in on freshwater plants. Saltwater snails are also a popular addition to many marine tanks. They tend to eat algae and plant matter just like freshwater snails do, but some snails are carnivorous. They also tend to be more colorful than their freshwater counterparts. For this reason, many aquarium enthusiasts prefer saltwater snails for their home tanks. Which snail you choose will largely depend on your personal aesthetics and your home aquarium setup. Bumble bee snails are carnivorous invertebrates. They typically eat meat-based detritus, including decomposing organisms in the tank, and have been known to eat other snails in the tank when food is scarce. Cerith snails are easy to care for and can help improve oxygenation within the substrate of an aquarium. They scavenge for algae, detritus, leftover food, and fish waste. Nassarius snails eat detritus, leftover food, decaying plant material, and fish wastes. They are excellent at keeping aquariums clean as they typically seek out a lot of food within the tank. Turbo snails are generally easy to care for and tend to be very colorful. They come in a number of varieties, including Astraea turbo snails and chestnut turbo snails, and they tend to feed on algae and dried seaweed flakes. If you're new to keeping aquatic snails, you may be uncertain about what to look for while selecting a snail. Avoid any snail that exhibits a loss of color, a lack of appetite, an inability to move/exert energy, a tendency to hide inside its shell, or visible spots or other types of fungus anywhere on the body or mouth, as these snails are most likely ill or carrying parasites. When you choose a snail, look for the following signs of good health: active movement within the water a healthy appetite for whatever type of food that snail prefers consistent/evenly-distributed coloring a clean shell It's important to be aware of the risks that come with certain varieties of aquatic snails. Some varieties are considered \\"pests,\\" appearing unexpectedly and reproducing on a large scale. These population booms can reduce oxygen content in the water, increase the levels of carbon dioxide, and create a great deal of organic waste through their excrement and eventual decomposition. When choosing aquatic snails, it's best to select snail varieties that are not generally considered pests by aquarium owners. Ramshorn snails are considered one of the biggest pest varieties. These snails reproduce quickly and in very large numbers. Pond snails and trumpet snails are also considered pests by many aquarium owners, though some owners select these snails for aesthetic reasons. Talk to an aquarium expert at your local pet store if you're not sure whether a particular variety of snail might become a pest in your tank.","response":"The article discusses various types of aquatic snails, their features, and their suitability for different aquarium setups, while also providing guidance on selecting healthy snails and avoiding pest snail varieties."},{"question":"Note the options at the end.

Hypothesis: people watch kids playing hop scotch .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","response":"We cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, because the premise and hypothesis are presenting two separate observations or scenarios, and one does not necessarily imply the other. Let's analyze both the premise and hypothesis to further understand why they cannot be directly linked or concluded to be true based on the other. Premise: \\"Manila children playing in spraying water on street while others watch.\\" This premise describes a scene where children in Manila are playing in spraying water on a street, and there are other people present who are watching the children play. This gives us information about the location (Manila), the activity (children playing in spraying water), and the presence of spectators (others watching). However, it does not provide any information about the game of hopscotch or whether people are watching kids playing hopscotch. Hypothesis: \\"People watch kids playing hop scotch.\\" The hypothesis posits that people watch kids playing hopscotch, which is a specific outdoor game involving hopping and jumping on numbered squares drawn on the ground. This game is different from the spraying water activity mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis does not explicitly state the location (unlike the premise), though it could be implied that it is a general statement about people watching kids playing hopscotch. Given the information available in both the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot conclusively state that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise does not provide enough information about the game of hopscotch or spectators watching kids play that specific game. The activities mentioned in both the premise and hypothesis are distinct and do not share common details. Furthermore, establishing a direct link between these two scenarios would require more information or additional context that specifically connects the two activities. In conclusion, the truth of the hypothesis cannot be determined based solely on the truth of the premise, as they both present different situations and do not share enough common details for one to imply the other. To evaluate the hypothesis's truth, we would need additional, relevant information or evidence regarding people watching kids playing hopscotch, independent of the premise provided."},{"question":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? such a good job of it","response":"The phrase \\"such a good job of it\\" can be considered positive when used in a particular context. The statement implies that someone has performed an action or task with a high level of efficiency, quality, or effectiveness. When we break down the phrase, \\"such a good job\\" emphasizes the substantial quality of the work, while \\"of it\\" refers to the task or action specifically being discussed. In combination, they create a statement that focuses on the exceptional outcome of the effort. There are some factors that could influence whether this phrase is perceived as positive or negative. They include: 1. The context in which it is used: The situation in which this phrase is applied will largely determine whether it’s praised or disapproved. If uttered in genuine appreciation or admiration of someone's work, it shall carry an affirmative tone. However, if spoken sarcastically or within a negative context, the phrase may bear unfavorable connotations, but it's important to notice that the sarcasm would be derived not from the phrase itself but the tone of the speaker and the situation. 2. The person being addressed: The individual's perception of the phrase and their experiences can influence how they interpret the statement. For instance, if the person has received such remarks in the past, followed by strong criticism, they may perceive it as not entirely positive. 3. The speaker's intonation and demeanor: Oftentimes, nonverbal cues help discern the meaning and sentiment of a statement. For instance, if the speaker appears supportive and encouraging while saying the phrase, it is likely to be understood as positive. However, if their tone is sarcastic, dismissive, or indifferent, the counterpart might perceive the remark negatively. In summary, the phrase \\"such a good job of it\\" is generally considered positive as it acknowledges the quality of work or the successful completion of a task. However, the speaker's tone, the context, and the person being addressed could play a role in its final interpretation, but that will likely not change the inherently positive nature of the phrase."},{"question":"Answer the following Q with stream of consciousness.

The capital, Tórshavn, is located on its east coast. The name means \\"island of currents\\". It also refers to the largest region of the country that also includes the islands of Hestur, Koltur and Nólsoy. - Nólsoy is an island and village in central Faroe Islands, 4 km east of the capital Tórshavn in Streymoy. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Koltur is an island in the Faroe Islands, located to the west of Streymoy and to the north of Hestur. The island has just one settlement, Koltur. It was abandoned in the 1980s by the sheep-farmers whose flocks grazed on the southern part of the island. Since then only two people have returned (in 1994). Koltur has two mountains, Kolturshamar (478 m) and Fjallið (101m) which strictly speaking is not a mountain, the name however translates directly as \\"The Mountain\\" and is considered by many as the smallest mountain in the country. - Hestur is an island in the central Faroe Islands, to the west of Streymoy and the south of Koltur. \\"Hestur\\" means \\"horse\\" in Faroese. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland.

Options: - speeding ticket - use gas - go fast - anxiety - get to work Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"The goal of driving to work is to reach your workplace in a safe and timely manner, allowing you to carry out your job responsibilities. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to understand the options you provided: 1. Speeding ticket: This is not a goal of driving to work. A speeding ticket is a penalty given to drivers who exceed the speed limit. The goal should be to follow traffic rules, including speed limits, to reach work safely. 2. Use gas: Using gas is a necessity for operating traditional gas-powered vehicles. However, it's not the goal of driving to work. The primary purpose of using gas is to power the vehicle, so you can reach your destination. Using too much gas can be harmful to the environment and also expensive. Thus, it's better to focus on driving efficiently to minimize gas consumption. 3. Go fast: Going fast is also not the goal of driving to work. While it's important to reach your workplace on time, you should not compromise on safety. Following the speed limits and maintaining a steady pace helps ensure you can react appropriately to any traffic situations and avoid accidents. 4. Anxiety: Anxiety is an emotional state that you'd want to avoid while driving to work. Driving can sometimes be a source of anxiety for various reasons, such as dealing with traffic or personal concerns. However, the goal is to remain calm and focused on the road to ensure a smooth and safe commute. 5. Get to work: This is the main goal of driving to work. The primary purpose of commuting is to arrive at your workplace so you can carry out your job duties. As long as you follow traffic rules and drive safely, you'll achieve this goal without compromising your safety or the safety of others on the road. In conclusion, the primary goal of driving to work is to reach your workplace safely and on time, while following traffic rules and minimizing any negative factors like speeding, excess gas consumption, and anxiety."},{"question":"Les pays suivants se portent coauteurs du projet de résolution, tel qu'il a été révisé oralement : Bosnie-Herzégovine, Cap-Vert, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Pays-Bas, République-Unie de Tanzanie, Serbie, Slovénie et Ukraine.

A further 13 people, including the pilot Andy Hill, were injured. In its final report on the disaster, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) listed a series of failings including poor risk assessments. Mr Hill, 52, from Hertfordshire, has been the subject of a manslaughter investigation by Sussex Police and was interviewed under caution. 'A fireball headed towards us at 400mph' Live updates: Shoreham air disaster report On publication of the report into the disaster, AAIB principal inspector Julian Firth said: \\"The aircraft crashed because at the top of its aerobatic manoeuvre it was too low to complete it.\\" The parents of victim Matthew Grimstone, 23, said: \\"Apart from anything that the pilot may have got wrong it is very evident the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Shoreham Air Show organisers have got much to answer for. \\"Rules laid down by the CAA were quite clearly inadequate and those that were there were, in some cases, not fully adhered to by the air show organisers.\\" Caroline Schilt, the mother of Jacob Schilt, who died along with fellow Worthing United player Mr Grimstone as they travelled in a car to a game, said she was happy with the AAIB's investigation, but there would still be unanswered questions until the inquests were held. \\"The AAIB has given us as a very comprehensive and factual report of their investigation... but there are still questions and they are ones for the coroner, and she is still waiting for all the inquiries to finish before she can go further.\\" A new date has now been set for the rescheduled pre-inquest review into the deaths. It will take place on 20 June at the West Sussex Coroner's Court, in Crawley, but no evidence will be heard. The organisers of the airshow said the report \\"clearly confirms that a series of errors by an experienced and fully authorised pilot were the cause of the tragic crash\\". The AAIB criticised risk assessments which did not adequately protect people in areas \\"outside the control of the organisers\\", but Shoreham chiefs claimed they had \\"always worked hard to ensure the event was both safe and successful\\". \\"Our main aim in 2015 was to do just that, but there are findings in the report that will require further analysis and reflection. \\"The report also contains important recommendations for the CAA, as well as the wider airshow industry, and these must be noted carefully,\\" they said. The report said the pilot carried out the manoeuvre at less than maximum thrust. It would have been possible to abort it safely at the apex of the loop but Mr Hill had not been trained in the escape manoeuvre which might have got him out of trouble. The AAIB also found the severity of the outcome of the crash was due to \\"an absence of provisions to mitigate the effects of an aircraft crashing in an area outside the control of the organisers of the flying display\\". The report said the risk assessment \\"was not suitable and sufficient to manage the risks to the public\\", and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) did not require to see or approve risk assessments before issuing a permission to hold a flying display. The AAIB made a total of 32 safety recommendations for the CAA. Ten are in the final report, including that airshow organisers must conduct suitable and sufficient risk assessments, and pilots must tell organisers what manoeuvres they will carry out and where. The AAIB also recommends that pilots should be trained in escape manoeuvres, and that displaying aircraft are separated from the public by a sufficient distance to minimise risk of injury to the public. It also recommends that the Department for Transport commission, and report the findings of, \\"an independent review of the governance of flying display activity to determine the form of governance that will achieve the level of safety it requires\\". Richard Westcott, transport correspondent Investigators interviewed the Shoreham pilot several times but critically, he can't remember anything about the accident. They say his flight helmet had dents in so it's possible he hit his head. What that means is that, although they know the aircraft was flying too low and too slow, and that the engine wasn't at full power when it should have been, they can only speculate as to why. One possible explanation they've looked at is whether the pilot got confused with another jet aircraft, called a Jet Provost, which he normally flies. The height and speed he started the Shoreham manoeuvre would be right for the Jet Provost, because it is smaller and lighter than the Hunter. Aviation specialists have suggested that he may have got the planes muddled up. But it's unlikely that we will ever know for sure. Sussex Police said it would be looking at the AAIB report in detail with its independent experts. Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz said: \\"We have been waiting some time for this report and it will take us some time to review. \\"We hope to do everything we can to submit a file of material to the CPS in advance of the pre-inquest review on 20 June. \\"As we have said before, this is an extraordinarily complex investigation, but we remain committed to finding answers for the families and friends of those who died.\\" Both the AAIB and CAA have already published a series of interim reports looking at the findings from the crash scene and implications for air displays around the UK An AAIB report in September 2015 found the jet showed \\"no abnormal indications\\" during its flight. But a further report in December said the aircraft had expired ejector seat parts and an out-of-date technical manual. In March last year, the AAIB said organisers of the Shoreham air show were unaware of the pilot's display plans. Safety measures at all UK civil air shows were enhanced following the disaster and the CAA said it had reviewed every aspect of air display safety. The AAIB made 21 safety recommendations which were all accepted by the CAA this year. Who were the Shoreham air crash victims? What is a summary of this text?","response":"The Shoreham Air Show crash in 2015, which killed 11 people, was the result of the pilot flying too low and too slow during an aerobatic manoeuvre, according to a report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).

Washington Booms As a New Gilded Age Takes Root\\" Article:","response":"Title: What Sequester? Washington Booms As a New Gilded Age Takes Root Introduction [Step 1: Introduce the topic of the article—Washington's economic boom and the new Gilded Age] As income inequality grows and the divide between the wealthy and the poor widens, it may seem difficult to spot the American cities that are experiencing economic booms. However, one such city stands out: Washington D.C., the nation's capital. Many are raising their eyebrows, wondering, \\"What sequester?\\" Amidst the federal budget cuts and the overall economic downturn, Washington has managed to rise above as a modern Gilded Age takes root in the city. A New Gilded Age [Step 2: Define the modern Gilded Age in terms of economic disparity and wealth accumulation] The term \\"Gilded Age\\" dates back to the late 19th century, a period in American history characterized by rapid economic growth and extreme income inequality. Coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner, the phrase signifies a thin layer of gold gilding over a less attractive core. In this case, the new Gilded Age is marked by a select few amassing immense wealth while the majority of the population remains economically stagnant or worse. Washington's Boom [Step 3: Explain the factors contributing to Washington's economic boom] The Washington D.C. area had its first economic surge during the 1990s with the rise of the information technology industry. Since then, numerous government contracts, lobbying firms, and federal jobs have continued to fuel the city's growth. It has also attracted a diverse and well-educated workforce, further augmenting its already lucrative economy. Effects on Surrounding Areas [Step 4: Examine how Washington's boom affects nearby communities] The impact of Washington's economic rise has spread to surrounding areas, most notably Northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs, where the population has swelled, and housing costs have skyrocketed. This side effect is particularly palpable in neighborhoods known for housing federal employees and contractors, showcasing the striking divide between the affluent and the struggling working class. A Divided Society [Step 5: Address the ethical and social implications of the new Gilded Age] While Washington's boom might seem like a cause for celebration for those reaping the benefits, it has also revealed a disturbing trend of economic inequality that extends far beyond D.C.'s borders. A divided society emerges with wealthy elites accumulating more wealth and influence, while countless American families face financial hardships. Conclusion [Step 6: Recap the main points and emphasize the need for addressing the issue] Washington D.C.'s economic boom and the emergence of the new Gilded Age might bring prosperity to a fortunate few, but it also underscores a concerning reality of wealth disparity both within the nation's capital and throughout the United States. As the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow, it is crucial for policymakers and citizens alike to address these issues, lest the modern Gilded Age becomes a permanent fixture in American society."},{"question":"You are presented with the question \\"what does a gasoline lawn mower convert gasoline into?\\" and the following answer choices: - motor - heat - pull cord - energy - ethanol - Energy. - heat energy - movement Now knowing that agasoline lawn mower converts gasoline into motion and movement is thought in motion, choose the best answer.","response":"Upon analyzing the answer choices, I will think step-by-step to choose the best one: 1.

The Patriots re-signed last season's star LeGarrette Blount who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early. On the opening possession of the game Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-6. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21-6. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24-6. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by James Ihedigbo. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27-6. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper Danny Aiken, who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center Dominic Raiola. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman Zach Moore by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-2, not only running their winning streak to 7 games, but also making it the 14th straight winning season for the Patriots.

By Peter Allen PUBLISHED: 04:19 EST, 17 July 2012 | UPDATED: 08:59 EST, 17 July 2012 Security has been stepped up around French president Francois Hollande after a gun-wielding man tried to break into the Elysée Palace. The would-be intruder, who has not been named, was arrested at the gates of the head of state’s official Paris home on Sunday afternoon. It led to fears that the 30-year-old was trying to mimic an attempt on the life of former French president Jacques Chirac a decade ago. Visitors walk in the gardens of the Elysée Palace in Paris, the official state home of President Francois Hollande, on Saturday. The next day a man wielding a gun tried to break into the building remains in custody, and the OPTIONS: - Elysée Palace prosecutors’ office has recommended - Francois Hollande prosecutors’ office has recommended - French prosecutors’ office has recommended - Jacques Chirac prosecutors’ office has recommended - Paris prosecutors’ office has recommended - Peter Allen prosecutors’ office has recommended","response":"The would-be intruder remains in custody, and the Paris prosecutors' office has recommended further investigation into the matter. They are working closely with the Elysée Palace security to review and enhance the existing protocols, in order to prevent any potential future breaches. In light of this security breach, French President Francois Hollande has called for a thorough review of the entire security apparatus that protects the Elysée Palace, as well as other government buildings and officials. As a result, heightened security measures have been put in place, including increased police presence, more stringent background checks, and closer surveillance of the palace premises. Meanwhile, investigators are trying to determine the motive and background of the arrested man, who appeared to have been acting alone. French officials have acknowledged that this incident, whether a prank or a genuine assassination attempt, is a reminder of the need to remain vigilant in maintaining the highest security standards for public figures as well as nationally important sites. The incident has also led many to draw comparisons with the 2002 attempt on the life of former French President Jacques Chirac. During a Bastille Day parade, a man named Maxime Brunerie produced a rifle hidden in a guitar case and fired towards President Chirac, though the shot missed him by a wide margin. The man was later sentenced to ten years in prison. While the circumstances of the recent attempt differ markedly from the Chirac case, both serve as reminders of the potential risks and dangers faced by public figures, as well as the importance of having comprehensive and effective security measures in place. In a world where threats can appear unexpectedly, vigilance and preparedness are key elements in safeguarding the lives of political leaders and the institutions they represent."},{"question":"Choose your answer: Is \\"Latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Who developed a heat-treating method that allowed carbon filaments to be molded into shapes?\\" Choices: (I). yes; (II). no;","response":"(II). no; Step 1: Read the question and understand what it's asking.

Despite its being a timed racing event, it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle. Ski cross courses have both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features including big-air jumps and high-banked turns. What sets ski cross apart from other alpine skiing disciplines is that there's more than one skier racing down the course.[1] Any intentional contact with other competitors leads to disqualification. Paragraph: Greg is an avid skier. He competes in many skiing competitions. He won several medals in those competitions. This November he will compete in two competitions - competition A, which is ski cross and competition B, which is an alpine skiing competition. Greg's fellow skier Bob is also competing in the same competitions. They both are exited about it.

Though he was not top billed, the film's original title—The Reno Brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: \\"Love Me Tender\\" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role.

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","response":"The product review conveys a negative sentiment. In analyzing elements of the review, you find phrases such as \\"I don't know what I was expecting,\\" which indicates the reviewer's uncertainty or dissatisfaction with the product. Furthermore, the commentator states, \\"this was hardly what I'd call a virtual vacation,\\" which further solidifies the negative sentiment. The use of the word \\"hardly\\" especially suggests that the product fell significantly short of the reviewer's expectations. The term 'virtual vacation' here could potentially indicate the reviewer's prior anticipations for a relaxing, pleasurable, or at least worthy experience. The actual outcome, as observed from the statement, was not in alignment with this expectation, leading to disappointment. The critic did not mention any positive aspects of the product or service, suggesting there was nothing of substantial value to be gleaned from their experience with the product.

Virginia Woolf was a prominent author, essayist, and literary critic during the early 20th century. She is considered one of the foremost modernist authors, and her works have had a profound impact on the development of English literature. Woolf was part of an influential literary group called the Bloomsbury Group, which included other notable writers, such as E.M. Forster, John Maynard Keynes, and Lytton Strachey. Woolf's writing is characterized by its innovative style, embracing stream of consciousness, nonlinear narrative, and exploration of the internal lives of her characters. Her novels often centered on the psychological and emotional experiences of women, criticizing the societal norms and gender expectations of her time. Some of her most famous works include the novels \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" (1925), \\"To the Lighthouse\\" (1927), and \\"Orlando\\" (1928), as well as the influential feminist essay \\"A Room of One's Own\\" (1929). Virginia Woolf was plagued by mental health issues throughout her life, experiencing bouts of severe depression and anxiety. Her episodes were often triggered by external factors, such as the death of family members and the two World Wars, which significantly impacted her personal life and the broader society. On March 28, 1941, Woolf filled her overcoat pockets with stones and waded into the River Ouse near her home in Sussex, England, ultimately drowning herself. Her husband, Leonard Woolf, found her suicide note, in which she expressed her love for him and her belief that her mental illness would not improve. The note read, in part, \\"I feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate.\\" Virginia Woolf's tragic death left a void in the literary world, but her innovative works and advocacy for women's rights and mental health awareness continue to influence readers and writers alike."},{"question":"Сатириазис Which language is this?","response":"The word \\"Сатириазис\\" is written in the Cyrillic alphabet, which is commonly used in Russian and some other Slavic languages. In this case, the word appears to be a transliteration of the Greek term \\"satyriasis\\", which refers to a condition in men characterized by excessive or abnormal sexual desire or an insatiable sexual appetite. It is the male counterpart to nymphomania in women. To provide more context, this term comes from Greek mythology, where satyrs were half-human, half-animal creatures who were followers of Dionysus, the god of wine, pleasure, and festivities. Satyrs were often depicted with exaggerated male genitalia, symbolizing lust and an uninhibited sex drive. Satyriasis in medical terms is considered to be a form of hypersexuality. This condition can lead to negative consequences, such as the inability to maintain healthy relationships, problems with work and social life, and potential legal issues if sexual behaviors become disruptive or nonconsensual. Treatment for satyriasis may involve therapy, medication, and support groups to help manage and regulate sexual behaviors and desires."},{"question":"Title: Sci-Fi without politics Review: Fast paced with enough technical stuff to be classified as \\"hard\\" science fiction.

Let's add 139 to both sides of the equation: 0 = -41 * o + 25 + 369 + 139 3. Now, let's add the numbers on the right side of the equation: 0 = -41 * o + 533 4. Now, we need to get the 'o' alone on one side. So, let's subtract 533 from both sides: -533 = -41 * o 5. Lastly, to find the value of 'o', we need to divide both sides by -41: -533 / -41 = o 6.

Choices: - persona - smile - laugh - act - singing The rationale to choose \\"smile\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"The rationale to choose \\"smile\\" as the answer is that in the context of a sales job, putting on a smile is the most appropriate action among the given choices. A salesperson's role involves interacting with customers, displaying a friendly and approachable demeanor, and promoting the company's products or services. A big smile is an essential element in achieving these goals, as it can make a significant difference in the success of a sales interaction. Let's examine the rationale for each of the other choices to further understand why \\"smile\\" is the ideal choice in this case. 1. Persona: While it's true that salespeople may take on a certain persona to be more persuasive and successful, the act of adopting a persona doesn't necessarily relate to being tired. It may come naturally to an individual or require some practice, but it doesn't address the need to appear energetic and enthusiastic despite feeling tired. 2. Laugh: A big laugh may be helpful during informal and relaxed interactions, but it may not be suitable when engaging in a sales conversation. A laugh is not guaranteed to make the customer feel comfortable or trust the salesperson more. Moreover, excessive laughing may seem unprofessional and could potentially result in a negative impression. 3. Act: Although a sales job may require some acting skills to put up a positive and confident front, the term \\"act\\" is broader than the specific action of smiling. It could include other aspects of performance and behavior and is not focused enough on the element of appearing energetic and welcoming despite being tired. 4. Singing: Singing is not a typical requirement or expectation in a sales job. Although it could be a unique approach to capturing a customer's attention, it is not a universally applicable or appropriate method for interacting with customers in most sales roles. Therefore, considering the nature of a sales job and given the five choices, \\"smile\\" best represents an action that a tired salesperson must put on as part of their responsibility to appear approachable, friendly, and professional. A big smile can bridge the gap between the salesperson and the customer, enhance communication, and help the salesperson convey confidence, empathy, and trustworthiness—qualities of paramount importance in the sales industry."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Answer the question below: If Mona works in a defense lab and her company develops worse missiles, what happens to the advancement of rocket technologies decreases or increases?

Step 1: Understand the context of the question Mona works in a defense lab, and her company is involved in developing missiles. The development of better missiles leads to the advancement of rocket technologies. Step 2: Identify the change in the situation The company develops worse missiles, meaning the quality and effectiveness of missiles being produced is reduced.

Step 4: Determine if the advancement of rocket technologies decreases or increases If worse missiles are being developed, it means that the progress in rocket technologies that comes from improving missile technology would be hindered or slowed down.

Answer the above question based on the context below: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of...

Another man then kills him with a sledgehammer to the face. A journalist, Carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe.

The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013, from 23% to 56% respectively (compared with an EU average of 49% and 79%). At the same time, there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection, from 4% in 2006 to 55% in 2013 (compared with an EU average of 30% and 76%). However, Greece also has the EU's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet: 36% in 2013, down from 65% in 2006 (compared with an EU average of 21% and 42%).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"Based on the provided information, in 2013, 56% of Greek households had access to the Internet at home. This is compared to the European Union (EU) average of 79% for that same year. It's important to note that Greece has seen significant growth in Internet access between 2006 and 2013, with the percentage of households with access more than doubling. Additionally, there has been a considerable increase in the number of households with broadband connections in Greece, rising from 4% in 2006 to 55% in 2013. This is fairly close to the EU average of 76% in 2013. However, it is worth mentioning that Greece had the EU's third-highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet, at 36% in 2013, decreasing from 65% in 2006. This is still higher than the EU average of 21% in 2013, down from 42% in 2006. To calculate the number of Europeans who could access the Internet from home in 2013, we would need to know the total population of Europe or the European Union and apply the 79% EU average to that number. Unfortunately, the provided information does not give the total population, so we cannot determine the exact number of Europeans with home Internet access in 2013. However, we can confidently state that 79% of European households, on average, had access to the web from their homes in 2013."},{"question":"Some viruses live in a dormant state inside the body.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"Let's analyze both sentences step-by-step to determine if they are paraphrases of each other. Sentence 1: Sunnis make up 77 percent of Pakistan's population, Shiites 20 percent. - It provides information about the percentage of Sunnis and Shiites in the context of Pakistan's population. - It implies that Sunnis comprise 77% of the entire population while Shiites make up 20%. Sentence 2: About 80 percent of Pakistan's 140 million people are Sunnis. - It provides information about the percentage of Sunnis in Pakistan's population, with a slight approximation (80%). - It gives a specific number for the total population of Pakistan (140 million). Now let's compare both sentences: - Sentence 1 mentions both Sunni and Shiite percentages, while Sentence 2 only mentions Sunnis. - Sentence 2 contains a slight approximation (80%) for the Sunni's percentage, different from Sentence 1 (77%). - Sentence 2 provides the total population of Pakistan, which is not present in Sentence 1. Conclusion: These sentences are not paraphrases of each other, as they contain different information. The first sentence mentions percentages for both Sunnis and Shiites, and the second sentence focuses on Sunnis with a slightly different percentage and includes the total population of Pakistan."},{"question":"Information: - The Creatures were a band formed in 1981 by Siouxsie and the Banshees members Siouxsie Sioux and Budgie.

First, we are going to simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, we see two terms with \\"w\\", -385*w and -137*w. We can combine them and get: -522*w On the right side, we have the numbers 8540, 17101, and -95589.

In his yard, Michael doesn't compost things, while Benjamin does, so","response":"Benjamin's garden is flourishing with all sorts of vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Michael, on the other hand, struggles to maintain his plants. Although their yards are side by side, the difference between the two is striking. Michael's yard is often plagued with weeds, and his plants never seem to grow well, while Benjamin's yard is a picture of horticultural abundance. Benjamin has often offered advice to Michael, but so far, the latter has been reluctant to change his ways. One day, Michael notices his neighbor's compost bin and the piles of decomposing food scraps and yard waste. He finally asks Benjamin how composting has benefitted his garden. Benjamin is more than happy to share his knowledge with Michael. \\"Composting,\\" Benjamin explains, \\"lets me turn our kitchen scraps and garden waste into a rich, organic material called humus. This humus provides essential nutrients for my plants and can improve the overall soil structure and drainage.\\" Michael is intrigued, but he worries that composting might be time-consuming and complicated. Benjamin assures him that once a basic understanding of the process is in place, composting becomes second nature. In fact, it can save time in the long run, as it reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and can even decrease the frequency of watering. Eager to give composting a try, Michael decides to start a small compost pile in his yard. Benjamin offers Michael some helpful advice, such as what types of materials are best for composting. They include fruit and vegetable scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, grass clippings, leaves, and small branches. Benjamin also explains that a balance of green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials should be maintained in the compost pile. Too much or too little of either can slow down the decomposition. The process can be sped up by regularly turning the pile to allow air to circulate and keep it at the right temperature. Over time, the compost pile heats up, and billions of microorganisms work to break down the organic material into humus. This rich, earthy substance is then ready to be used as a natural fertilizer for Michael's garden. Months pass, and Michael diligently follows Benjamin's advice. He regularly turns the compost pile and adds a mix of green and brown materials. Eventually, he notices that the pile's dark, crumbly texture resembles fertile soil, a sign that it is ready to be used in his garden. Michael applies the compost to his vegetable patch and flower beds as a top dressing, mixing it thoroughly into the soil. Almost immediately, he notices a change in his garden. There is a significant decrease in weeds, and his plants appear healthier and more vibrant than ever before. Even his water usage has dropped, as the improved soil structure retains moisture more efficiently. As Michael stands in his garden, admiring the fruits of his labor, he can't help but feel a sense of pride. With the help of his neighbor, Benjamin, and the power of composting, he has transformed his once lackluster yard into an oasis teeming with life. Months later, Michael and Benjamin sit on their respective porches, sipping cold drinks and chatting about gardening. They exchange tips and share stories of their latest triumphs in the garden. Through their shared passion, the once-reluctant Michael has not only discovered the joys and benefits of composting, but he has also forged a strong and lasting friendship with Benjamin."},{"question":"Incline Village is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washoe County, Nevada on the north shore of Lake Tahoe.

Additionally, Christopher was the basketball team's star player, which greatly influenced his confidence in their ability to win. Step 1: Understand the characters and their feelings Samuel's lack of confidence stems from his realistic perspective and the consideration of potential negative outcomes. On the other hand, Christopher's high confidence stems from his inherent optimism and his role as the star player on the team. Step 2: Introduce a triggering event or situation The big game was just around the corner, and the team was set to face their toughest opponents yet, the Hawks. They were considered the best team in the league, having won the previous season's championship. Step 3: Develop characters' actions and reactions based on their feelings and the event As the game approached, Samuel's anxiety grew. He carefully analyzed the Hawks' previous games, noting their strengths and weaknesses, and was becoming increasingly concerned about his own team's chances. Even though he knew that Christopher's incredible skills could help, he couldn't shake off his doubts. Meanwhile, Christopher continued training, focused on improving his moves and strategies. He believed that the key to success was in maintaining a positive outlook, so he encouraged his teammates to do the same. Due to his vigorous training sessions and motivational speeches, the team's spirits were lifted. Step 4: Develop a plot twist or escalation of events On the day of the match, Samuel's fears seemed to come true when the Hawks opened with a strong lead. However, Christopher's unwavering determination to win spread throughout the team, and they managed to narrow the gap before the half-time whistle. During the break, Samuel nervously approached Christopher, voicing his concerns. Instead of dismissing Samuel's worries, Christopher acknowledged them and responded with reassurance, explaining that they would have to keep pushing themselves to the very end to have a chance at victory. Step 5: Reach a climax and resolve the story With Samuel and Christopher now united in their determination, the second half began. Their team fought hard, and, with only seconds left on the clock, Christopher scored the winning point in a spectacular display of athleticism and skill. The team erupted in celebration, with Samuel and Christopher embracing each other in the middle of the court. They had both learned valuable lessons that day: for Samuel, to trust in his team's ability to overcome challenges, and for Christopher, to recognize the usefulness of realistic thinking in achieving goals. The two friends strengthened their bond and, together, led their team to even greater heights in the seasons to come."},{"question":"This is the content of an email: Please find attached the referenced list.

How do I stop my American Staffy/Kelpie mix from biting its tail? Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"No, those questions do not have the same meaning. The first question asks how to stop the dog from biting objects or belongings, while the second question asks how to stop the dog from biting its own tail. Both issues could be symptoms of different underlying causes, so I will provide solutions to each problem separately. 1. Stopping an American Staffy/Kelpie mix from biting your stuff: a. Proper training: Begin by teaching your dog the basic commands, such as \\"sit,\\" \\"stay,\\" \\"leave it,\\" and \\"drop it.\\" This will help establish a strong foundation for communication and discourage unwanted behaviors. b. Good exercise: Make sure your dog gets adequate physical activity. A bored or under-stimulated dog is more likely to engage in destructive behaviors, such as biting or chewing household items. c. Mental stimulation: Provide your dog with various interactive toys and puzzles to keep its mind occupied and engaged. A mentally challenged dog is less inclined to chew on your belongings. d. Appropriate chew toys: Give your dog a range of safe and durable chew toys. Redirect any attempts to bite your stuff by offering an appropriate alternative, like a chew toy or a bone. e. Taste deterrents: Apply safe and non-toxic deterrents, such as bitter apple spray, to objects that your dog tends to chew. This will help discourage the chewing behavior by creating an unpleasant taste. f. Positive reinforcement: Reward and praise your dog when it chooses to chew on appropriate toys instead of your belongings. This reinforcement will help your dog learn which items are acceptable to chew on. g. Crate training: If supervised training and redirection aren't effective, consider crate training your dog when you cannot directly supervise it. This will prevent access to your belongings while you are away or unable to fully supervise the dog. 2. Stopping an American Staffy/Kelpie mix from biting its tail: a. Health check: Consult with your veterinarian to rule out any medical issues, such as allergies, fleas, or skin conditions, that may cause your dog to bite its tail. Your vet will be able to offer professional advice and treatment options if a health concern is detected. b. Anxiety and stress: Pay attention to any possible environmental stressors that could be causing anxiety in your dog. Tail-biting can sometimes be a self-soothing behavior for anxious dogs. Eliminate or mitigate these stressors and consider consulting a canine behavior specialist for guidance on how to help your dog cope with anxiety. c. Environmental enrichment: Offer a stimulating environment by providing a variety of toys, playtime opportunities, and mentally enriching activities to ensure your dog doesn't resort to tail-biting out of boredom. d. Redirect the behavior: If you catch your dog biting its tail, redirect the behavior by offering an appropriate alternative, such as a chew toy. e. Positive reinforcement: Praise and reward your dog when it stops biting its tail upon your redirection. This will help reinforce the idea that biting its tail is an undesired behavior. Both questions address unwanted chewing or biting behaviors in dogs, but deal with different objects and their specific solutions. It is essential to analyze the underlying cause of the unwanted behavior for appropriate and effective intervention."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie opens with shots of people in the mall followed by shots of the parking lot where a man in a trench coat runs around flashing different women.

Article: You know how much your telephone has changed over the past 10 years? Your car will change even more than that in the next 10 years. One of the biggest changes is that cars will drive themselves. \\"We certainly have the technology for it now.\\"says Andrew Poliak of automotive technology supplier QNX.\\"We expect self-driving cars to be a mainstream thing between 2020 and 2025.\\" The American company Google has been working on self-driving cars for years. These cars are already on the roads in the United States and are truly self-driving. They have to steering wheels or pedals . Last week, the police ordered one of Google's cars to stop for driving too slowly on a public road. The car was not breaking any law, so no one was punished. Another American company, Tesla, added an \\"Autopilot\\" feature to its cars last month. With the Autopilot turned on, the vehicle drives itself. The car will speed up, slow down, _ and drive by itself. You can take over driving any time by turning the steering wheel or touching a pedal. The car uses sensors to know when driveway changing is safe and whether it should speed up or slow down. Tesla Autopilot is made for cross-country driving. It keeps you in the driveway and helps you avoid hitting other cars. It does not work well on local roads, for it will not stop at a red light or stop sign. Reporter Carolyn Nicander Mohr tried the Autopilot feature of a Tesla earlier this month. She had a hard time trusting the car to do what it should do. She thought about disabling the Autopilot feature many times during her trip. She wanted to take control at every bend in the road and hit the brake when the car in front of her slowed down.

The process you described above is known as photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants convert light energy (from the sun), carbon dioxide (from the air), and water (from the soil) into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The break down of fats in plants is a somewhat separate process that is part of plant respiration, a process which converts sugars (like glucose) into energy for the plant’s cellular processes. Fats, similar to sugars, are energy storage molecules. When a plant breaks down more fats, it means the plant is utilizing its stored energy reserves. Now, if a plant is breaking down more fats, it indicates that the plant is in need of energy; this could be due to less availability of sugar (which is usually the first choice for energy production). This could be due to a reduction in photosynthesis, which could result in less sugar and oxygen being produced. The plant is compensating for the reduced sugar production by breaking down its stored fats. Hence, the breakdown of more fats could be associated with less sugar and oxygen production in plants."},{"question":"Kazı çalışmaları, sahada bir arkeoloji parkı kurma amaçlı 25 bin avroluk bir proje kapsamında yer alıyor.

Step-by-step Reasoning: 1. We are given two numbers, 97 and 98, and asked to find their product. 2. To find the product, we need to multiply the two numbers together. 3. Multiplying one number by another involves adding that number to itself a certain number of times. In this case, we need to add 97 to itself 98 times. 4. To make this easier, we can break down 98 into smaller numbers, such as 2 and 49. Now we need to add 97 to itself 2 times and then add that result to itself 49 times. 5. First, let's find the result of 2 * 97. We add 97 to itself once, which gives us 194. 6. Next, we need to multiply 194 by 49. This involves adding 194 to itself 49 times. 7. To simplify this, we can use the property of multiplication that states (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). This means we can first multiply 49 by 2 before multiplying it by 194. 8. 49 multiplied by 2 is 98. 9. Now we can multiply 194 by 98. 10. 194 * 98 involves adding 194 to itself 98 times. We can do this either by performing the calculations or using a calculator. 11. After performing the calculation, we find that the product of 194 and 98 is 9492.

Options: - (A) Plant growth is reduced - (B) They may not survive. - (C) Aquatic life sinks - (D) harm them - (E) It is endangered - (F) Damages them - (G) Aquatic life moves to dry land - (H) Aquatic life flourishes. Let's reason step-by-step:","response":"The correct option for the situation in which acidity is higher or lower than a narrow range is (B) They may not survive. Let's reason step-by-step: - Aquatic life is highly sensitive to the acidity (pH) of the water in which it lives. The ideal pH range for most aquatic life forms is between 6.5 and 8.5. Deviations from this narrow range can have significant consequences for the health and survival of aquatic organisms. - (A) is partially true. When acidity levels are outside the ideal range, it can reduce plant growth, particularly underwater plants that provide habitat and oxygen to the ecosystem. - (B) is the most accurate and comprehensive answer. Aquatic life may not survive when the pH level deviates from their optimal range because it can affect their physiology, leading to illness, reproductive issues, or death. - (C) is incorrect. Acidity levels do not directly cause aquatic life to sink. - (D), (E), and (F) are true to some extent but do not provide the full scope of the issue compared to (B). Acidity levels outside the ideal range can harm, endanger, and damage aquatic life, but the broader consequence is that many organisms may ultimately not survive. - (G) is incorrect. Acidity changes in the water do not force aquatic life to move to dry land. Aquatic life forms are adapted to live in water and cannot survive in terrestrial environments. - (H) is incorrect. Acidity levels outside the ideal range do not generally cause aquatic life to flourish. In fact, changes in acidity can lead to negative impacts on individual species and the overall ecosystem. In conclusion, when acidity levels in the water are outside the ideal range for aquatic life, the most significant outcome is that these organisms may not survive (Option B). This can result from direct harm, reproductive issues, reduced plant growth, or imbalances in the ecosystem that affect species' ability to thrive."},{"question":"Is \\"He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What was Abdul Karim teaching Queen Victoria after his promotion?\\"","response":"While the given statement does provide some information on Abdul Karim's role after his promotion, a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question, \\"What was Abdul Karim teaching Queen Victoria after his promotion?\\" would be: Abdul Karim, an Indian attendant who later became a confidant to Queen Victoria, was promoted to the position of \\"Munshi\\" or teacher in 1887. His promotion led to him having a significant influence on Queen Victoria's perspective about India and her role as the Empress of India. Following his promotion, Abdul Karim took up multiple responsibilities that not only included teaching her Hindustani but also acting as a clerk, advisor, and secretary. As Munshi, Abdul Karim taught Queen Victoria the Hindustani language (present-day Urdu), the language spoken by a significant portion of the Indian population, especially in the northern region. This enabled Queen Victoria to communicate with Indian dignitaries and officials more effectively and understand many aspects of Indian culture. Queen Victoria's interest in learning Hindustani and her effort in taking lessons from Abdul Karim showcased an insight into British-Indian relations during the period and her commitment to her role as the Empress of India. Furthermore, Abdul Karim's role as Munshi went beyond teaching the language. He acted as a clerk and secretary handling Queen Victoria's official correspondence. He also played an advisory role, providing crucial insights on Indian matters and Indian people, their customs, traditions, and experiences under British rule. This subsequently helped Queen Victoria develop a broader understanding of Indian affairs and enabled her to make more informed decisions related to the country. In conclusion, after his promotion to Munshi, Abdul Karim was teaching Queen Victoria the Hindustani language, contributing to her understanding of India, its people, culture, and politics. He also acted as a clerk, secretary, and advisor on Indian matters, which allowed Queen Victoria to gain a more profound and empathetic view of her Indian subjects."},{"question":"Background: Povenmire was born in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, and grew up in the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". Context: In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh conceived the series Phineas and Ferb, based on their similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. Povenmire spent 14-16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing \\"It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on.\\" Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: \\"Usually that means they throw it in the trash later,\\" Povenmire recalled. Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States. Instead of a conventional script, the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved the show for a 26-episode season. Povenmire left Family Guy to create the series. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to incorporate into Phineas and Ferb the kind of humor they had developed in their work on Rocko's Modern Life. They included action sequences and, with Disney's encouragement, featured musical numbers in every episode subsequent to \\"Flop Starz\\". Povenmire described the songs as his and Marsh's \\"jab at immortality\\", but the pair have earned two Emmy nominations for Phineas and Ferb songs to-date. A third Emmy nomination, for the episode \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" (2008), pitted the show against SpongeBob SquarePants, although neither nominee received the award due to a technicality. In 2010, Povenmire was nominated amongst several other Phineas and Ferb crew members for the Daytime Emmy Award for both \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\" and \\"Outstanding Original Song - Children's and Animation\\" for their work on the show, winning for \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\". The distinctive style of the animation legend Tex Avery influenced the show's artistic look. Like Avery, Povermire employed geometric shapes to build both the characters and the background. The style developed almost accidentally, with Povenmire's first sketch of title character, Phineas Flynn, which he produced while eating dinner with his family in a restaurant in South Pasadena, California. He doodled a triangle-shaped child on the butcher paper covering the table. He was so taken with sketch he tore it out, kept it, and used it as the prototype for Phineas and as the stylistic blueprint for the entire show. Question: How did this become phineas?.

This will then allow us to determine whether the given premise entails the hypothesis \\"If your visitors come, I will talk to them.\\" The premise consists of two main parts: a commitment and a condition. 1. Commitment: \\"I will speak with your visitors as I agreed\\" 2. Condition: \\"if they come\\" The condition, \\"if they come,\\" indicates that the speaker will only fulfill the commitment if the condition is met, i.e., the visitors arrive. This means that the commitment (speaking with the visitors) depends upon the fulfillment of the condition (the visitors coming). Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"If your visitors come, I will talk to them.\\" This statement is structured as a conditional statement, with the antecedent being \\"your visitors come\\" and the consequent being \\"I will talk to them.\\" If the antecedent (the visitors coming) is true, the speaker is promising to fulfill the consequent (talking to the visitors). Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that both statements essentially convey the same meaning. The premise is expressing a commitment made by the speaker to talk to the visitors on the condition that they come. The hypothesis, as a conditional statement, asserts that the speaker will engage in conversation with the visitors if they arrive. Thus, it can be concluded that if the premise \\"I will speak with your visitors as I agreed, if they come\\" is true, it does entail the hypothesis \\"If your visitors come, I will talk to them.\\" This is because both statements present the same relationship between the commitment of talking to the visitors and the condition of the visitors arriving. In both cases, the speaker promises to talk to the visitors if (and only if) they come, making the two statements logically equivalent and indicating that the premise entails the hypothesis."},{"question":"Translate \\"Ryosuke Irie\\" to Finnish?","response":"As an AI language model, I understand that you are asking for a translation of the name \\"Ryosuke Irie\\" into Finnish.

Twenty Palaeolithic sites have been identified in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic artefacts recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the artefacts found include points, scrapers, and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of artefacts have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed artefacts and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough's Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.Within the Mendip Hills AONB, good evidence exists for 286 definite examples of round barrows, including the Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. The Historic England Archive holds over 1,200 entries for the area, and there are over 600 listed buildings, in addition to over 200 scheduled ancient monuments. These protected monuments range from prehistoric barrows and hillforts to the Black Down bombing decoy from the Second World War.Settlement on the Mendip Hills appears to fall into two types. The first, apparent in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated on a small scale in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.There is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, when there were technological changes in metal-working... The answer to this question is:","response":"The culture's invasion of the hills that were occupied by two types of settlements was most likely for silver is not explicitly mentioned in the given article. However, since the article discusses mining dating back to the late Bronze Age and the presence of large landholdings based on mines from the Iron Age onwards, it can be inferred that a culture from either the Bronze Age or Iron Age could have invaded the hills for silver or other metal resources."},{"question":"Teacher:You will be given a person's personality, and a history of a conversation this person has had.

Title: The Boat That Rocked Movie plot: he movie opens with the information that during the 1960s, even though British rock was at its peak, British radio refused to play rock music. This led to the creation of pirate radio stations, which kept their ships anchored off the coast and played rock music 24/7.A boat approaches the Pirate Radio ship and drops off Young Carl (Tom Sturridge), a young man who has been expelled from school for smoking marijuana. He has been sent to spend time with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who owns the ship, allegedly to straighten him out. Quentin introduces Carl to the rest of the crew: The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an American DJ who is the star of the station; Simon, a slightly awkward guy who dreams of finding romance; John, who does news and weather; Dave, who is extremely popular with the ladies; Angus, whom no one really likes but who runs a \\"crazy\\" comedy show; and Felicity, a lesbian who cooks for the boys. Carl is to room with Thick Kevin, who is unbelievably stupid.Carl's first night on the boat is a raucous party and we see scenes of the DJs running their shows spliced with the British people who listen to them. Millions of Britons are tuning in to Pirate Radio, and this greatly disturbs Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh), who is put in charge of eliminating the problem of Pirate Radio. With the help of his new assistant, Twatt (Jack Davenport), they begin working to put Pirate Radio out of business.Twatt's first plan is to eliminate funding for Pirate Radio by making it illegal for British companies to advertise with them. Quentin breaks this news to the crew, explaining that in order to try to recoup their losses, he will be bringing in the famous DJ Gavin (Rhys Ifans). This disappoints the Count, who is used to being #1 on the station and is jealous of Gavin.During Carl's time on the boat he meets Mark, the late night DJ who never speaks and is referred to as \\"the sexiest man in the world.\\" While they are sitting on deck, they begin discussing their conjugal visits: since they never go...

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Option 1: Rural area - Bald eagles are found in North America, primarily around large bodies of water, forests, and wetlands. A rural area might be a suitable habitat for them. Option 2: Book - Although bald eagles may be featured in books about wildlife or as a symbol of the United States, this is not their natural environment. Option 3: Canada - Bald eagles can be found in Canada, as their range extends across the continent from Alaska to parts of Canada and the United States. Option 4: Painting - A painting might depict a bald eagle, but it is not where they naturally exist. Option 5: Aviary - An aviary is a place where birds are kept, so it is possible to find a bald eagle in an aviary, particularly in a zoo or wildlife sanctuary. In summary: A bald eagle is most likely to be found in a rural area or Canada as their natural habitat, but could also be in an aviary. Therefore, the most accurate options would be a rural area, Canada, and an aviary."},{"question":"How to change a page to landscape on microsoft word on pc or mac<br>Open the document in microsoft word.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Input: Paragraph: Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been implicated in the etiology of adult communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). We investigated RSV infection in Chilean adults with CAP using direct viral detection, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR), and serology (microneutralization assay). Methods. RSV, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria were studied by conventional and molecular techniques in adults aged 18 years presenting with CAP to the healthcare facilities in Santiago, Chile from February 2005 through December 2007. Results. All 356 adults with CAP enrolled had an acute blood sample collected at enrollment, and 184 had a convalescent blood sample. RSV was detected in 48 cases (13.4%). Immunofluorescence assay and viral isolation each detected only 1 infection (0.2%), whereas rtRT-PCR was positive in 32 (8.9%) cases and serology was positive in 20 (10.8%) cases. CAP clinical characteristics were similar in RSV-infected and non-RSV-infected cases. RSV-specific geometric mean serum-neutralizing antibody titer (GMST) was significantly lower at admission in the 48 RSV-infected cases compared with 308 non-RSV-infected adults (GMST in log 2 : RSV/A 8.1 vs 8.9, and RSV/B 9.3 vs 10.4; P , .02). Conclusions. RSV infection is frequent in Chilean adults with CAP. Microneutralization assay was as sensitive as rtRT-PCR in detecting RSV infection and is a good adjunct assay for diagnostic research. High RSV-specific serum-neutralizing antibody levels were associated with protection against common and severe infection. The development of a vaccine could prevent RSV-related CAP in adults. Title: Role of Neutralizing Antibodies in Adults With Community-Acquired Pneumonia by Respiratory Syncytial Virus Output:","response":"True Explanation: In this task, you are given a paragraph and a title from a research paper.

The devastating case has highlighted the issue of domestic violence and captured public attention throughout the nation. The man, whose name has been withheld to protect the privacy of the surviving family members, confessed to the gruesome homicides in his initial appearance in front of the judge. Court records indicate that he strangled his pregnant wife and drowned their three young children, aged 2, 4, and 6, in the family bathtub. Following these heinous acts, the perpetrator wrapped the lifeless bodies of his family in plastic bags and dumped them in a nearby wooded area. Upon discovering the grisly scene, law enforcement officers acted quickly to launch a thorough investigation. Gathering evidence and interrogating potential witnesses, the detectives managed to piece together the frightening sequence of events that led to the devastating loss of life. Ultimately, the man's confession confirmed their suspicions and solidified the case against him. Throughout the trial, the courtroom remained tense as chilling details emerged. The defense team argued that the man's behavior was influenced by a myriad of factors, including drug addiction, financial stress, and undiagnosed mental health issues. However, the prosecution countered these arguments, emphasizing that regardless of his personal struggles, he made the choice to violently end the lives of his family members - an act that is deemed inexcusable under any circumstance. As the trial progressed, testimonies from various sources painted a disturbing picture of the man's troubled past. Relationships with former partners had been marked by instances of abuse and manipulation, whereas colleagues and acquaintances recalled sudden mood swings and erratic behavior. This background information provided a vital context that allowed the jury to better understand the accused's actions. After a highly emotional and tense trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of multiple counts of first-degree murder and the judge subsequently sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This sentence, while unable to bring back the lives of the victims, serves to provide a sense of closure and justice for the bereaved family and the entire community. The tragedy of this case has ignited a broader discussion on the importance of addressing mental health issues, seeking treatment for addiction, and promoting domestic violence prevention resources. In light of such heinous acts, it is crucial that individuals who are struggling in their relationships or personal lives receive the support they need to prevent future violence. As the community grapples with the aftermath of this unfathomable loss, law enforcement and social service agencies have vowed to increase their vigilance in identifying and addressing potential cases of domestic abuse. The public, too, must remain vigilant to signs of distress and conflict within their networks and support those in need. The case serves as an urgent reminder that behind closed doors, anyone can be vulnerable to the tragic consequences of domestic violence. It is essential that the societal stigma surrounding these issues be dismantled, and everyone play their part in creating a safer, more inclusive environment for those in need of help."},{"question":"Q: what is the public transportation in las vegas?

Question: suppose the calorie count goes up happens, how will it affect less seeds grow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","response":"I'll go through the steps of the task and analyze the effect of an increase in calorie count on the number of seeds that grow. 1. Get some seeds: The calorie count of the seeds won't affect this step as the primary aim is to simply acquire the seeds needed for planting. 2. Pick a spot to plant them: The calorie count won't influence the choice of planting location, as factors like sunlight, soil quality, and access to water are more important considerations. 3. Dig a hole in the dirt: The calorie count will have no effect on this step as it involves physical labor, not the seeds' properties. 4. Put the seed in the hole: The calorie count won't affect this step because the seed's placement in the hole is not influenced by its caloric value. 5. Pour some water on the seed and hole: Again, the calorie count will not affect this step as watering the seed is essential for its growth, regardless of its calorie content. 6. Cover up the hole: The calorie count won't affect this step, as the act of covering the hole is simply to protect the seed and ensure its growth. 7. Press down on it: The calorie count will have no impact on this step as the purpose of pressing down is to secure the seed in place so it can grow. 8. Spray some plant food on it: Since the plant food provides nutrients to support the seed's growth, a higher calorie count might improve the growth rate for seeds that require more energy to grow. However, it could also lead to an increase in competition among plants for resources, which could lead to fewer seeds growing overall. So, a definite conclusion cannot be drawn without more context. Based on the analysis of the steps, I would choose option B: less. If the calorie count goes up, it may lead to more significant competition among plants, causing fewer seeds to grow. It's important to note that the overall effect depends on the context, which includes factors like seed type and environmental conditions among others."},{"question":"Pick one category for the following text.

Nigella Lawson’s chances of conquering the lucrative U.S. market are now in danger of collapsing like a bad soufflé, experts said yesterday. Drugs claims surrounding the TV cook swept quickly across the Atlantic, where she had become a rising star as a judge on hit cookery competition The Taste. TV network ABC said a second series featuring Miss Lawson would be screened as planned in January, but sources said bosses were ‘debating’ whether to invite her back for a third. Advert: Nigella Lawson, 53, is seen (second from the left) in the promo for the new series of The Taste which was screened on ABC in the US last night.

Restaurant 'choking': Charles Saatchi puts his hand round Nigella Lawson's throat in a Mayfair, central London, earlier this year before their marriage collapsed. ‘We will wait to see the fallout from the court case and if there are further allegations of drug use,’ said the source. ‘If. these allegations are proven and substantiated, then her career on. American TV is over.’ The source added that the channel had ‘zero. tolerance’ towards drugs and claimed bad publicity would mean no. production company ‘will want to touch her’. ABC’s. flagship show Good Morning America featured a two-minute news report on. the trial of the Grillo sisters yesterday – but within hours the. network also broadcast a promotional clip for The Taste.

Armenia, a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region, boasts a rich and diverse culture with a deep historical background that spans thousands of years. From its early origins as part of the Kingdom of Urartu to its current status as a democratic nation, Armenia has experienced periods of prosperity, invasions, and great cultural achievements. 1. History: Armenia has a history dating back to antiquity. The Kingdom of Urartu, one of the earliest Armenian states, was established around the 9th century BCE and spanned territories in modern-day Turkey, Iran, and Armenia. The Kingdom of Urartu was later succeeded by the Orontid Dynasty, which led to Armenia's eventual conversion to Christianity in 301 AD, making it the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion. Over the centuries, Armenia fell under various domination, including Roman, Byzantine, Persian, Arab, Mongolian, and Ottoman rule, before the modern Republic of Armenia was established in 1918. 2. Culture: Armenia is known for its vibrant and eclectic culture, which has evolved over millennia. It draws rich heritage from various influences, including Roman, Byzantine, Persian, and Ottoman cultures. Some of the key aspects of Armenian culture include the Armenian language, which has its own alphabet and is part of the Indo-European language family, Armenian music, known for its haunting melodies and distinctive instruments, and Armenian architecture, which prominently features khachkars, cross-stone monuments, and churches with central-domed designs. Armenian cuisine is also diverse, incorporating a variety of herbs, fruits, vegetables, and meat dishes inspired by Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Eastern European flavors. 3. Religion: The majority of Armenians practice the Armenian Apostolic Church, one of the oldest branches of Christianity. Founded by two apostles, St. Thaddeus and St. Bartholomew, it played a significant role in the country's development, shaping its identity and fostering cultural and political resilience amid invasions and subjugation. 4. Diaspora: Due to historic events such as the Armenian Genocide and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia has experienced significant migration and has established a considerable diaspora in countries around the world. These vibrant communities have contributed to Armenia's cultural and economic development, preserving and sharing Armenian traditions and values. 5. Contemporary role in the region: In recent years, Armenia has established itself as a democratic republic with efforts aimed at modernizing its economy and infrastructure while maintaining its unique cultural identity. The country has faced various challenges, including ongoing tensions and conflicts with neighboring Azerbaijan and Turkey, which have significantly impacted regional politics and security. Armenia remains committed to integrating itself into the international community through membership in organizations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the Eurasian Economic Union, among others. In addition, Armenia has strived to maintain balanced relations with countries in the region, including Russia, Iran, and Georgia. In conclusion, Armenia is a country with an immense cultural and historical legacy. Its resilient people have endured many challenges throughout history, and continue to navigate contemporary geopolitical challenges while cultivating a unique identity deeply rooted in Armenian language, religion, art, and tradition."},{"question":"St. John's economy is connected to both its role as the provincial capital of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the ocean. The civil service which is supported by the federal, provincial and municipal governments has been the key to the expansion of the city's labour force and to the stability of its economy, which supports a sizable retail, service and business sector. The provincial government is the largest employer in the city, followed by Memorial University. With the collapse of the fishing industry in Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1990s, the role of the ocean is now tied to what lies beneath it – oil and gas – as opposed to what swims in or travels across it. The city is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Eastern Canada and is one of 19 World Energy Cities. ExxonMobil Canada is headquartered in St. John's and companies such as Chevron, Husky Energy, Suncor Energy and Statoil have major regional operations in the city.

How to respect other cultures Practice self-awareness. One of the most important ways to learn to become respectful of other cultures is to spend some time reflecting on your own beliefs and biases. Each of us has what is known as a \\" filter \\".","response":"This filter is the perspective through which we view the world and is shaped by our own personal experiences, values, upbringing, and education. Being self-aware of this filter and understanding that everyone has a unique perspective can help you become more receptive to different cultures and ideas that may not align with your own. Educate yourself about different cultures. You can begin by reading books, articles, watching documentaries, or attending cultural events that can help you broaden your knowledge of various cultures. Becoming knowledgeable about the history, customs, traditions, religious beliefs, and practices can help you develop a better understanding of different cultures and ultimately increase your respect for them. Be curious and open-minded. Adopting an attitude of curiosity and open-mindedness can lead to better appreciation and understanding of other cultures. Without judgment, seek to learn about the reasons behind certain cultural practices, and be open to the idea that different customs can be as valid and valuable as your own. Travel to different countries and places. One of the most effective ways to cultivate a deep respect for other cultures is by traveling and immersing yourself in various cultural experiences. By doing so, you will have the opportunity to interact with locals, learn about their way of life, and observe the cultural dynamics in different parts of the world firsthand. Engaging in cultural exchanges can help you develop empathy, understanding, and respect for other cultures. Practice active listening. Take the time to listen to the opinions, ideas, and experiences of those who come from different cultural backgrounds. This will give you a deeper understanding of their perspectives, which can foster greater respect for their culture. Additionally, being an active listener can make others feel more comfortable and valued when they share their thoughts with you, strengthening the quality of your interactions. Emphasize similarities over differences. While it's essential to recognize and appreciate cultural differences, it's also crucial to focus on the commonalities that unite us as human beings. This awareness will help to promote respect and understanding across cultural lines. Acknowledge and challenge stereotypes. Stereotypes are harmful generalizations that can lead to misunderstandings and perpetuate negative biases. Recognizing and challenging these stereotypes is key to respecting other cultures. It's important to remember that individuals are unique, and it's unfair to judge or categorize them based on preconceived ideas. Learn the basics about cultural etiquette. Understanding the basics of cultural etiquette and norms can help you demonstrate respect when interacting with individuals from various cultures. For example, learning how to greet someone properly or knowing the appropriate body language and gestures can make a big difference when establishing rapport with others. Respect cultural boundaries and customs. Every culture has its own set of boundaries and customs that are considered appropriate or acceptable. Demonstrating respect for other cultures involves being aware of these boundaries and following them when engaging with others. For instance, you could be sensitive to their dietary preferences, dressing modestly when necessary, or refraining from using offensive language or actions. Adopt a culturally sensitive attitude. By acknowledging the value and worth of every culture, you can create an environment that fosters respect, understanding, and cooperation. Recognize that your own cultural background and experiences are just a part of the diverse tapestry of human life and strive to be inclusive and understanding of others. In summary, respecting other cultures starts with developing self-awareness, educating yourself about different cultural backgrounds, actively listening, being curious and open-minded, emphasizing similarities, challenging stereotypes, understanding cultural etiquette, respecting cultural boundaries and customs, and incorporating a culturally sensitive attitude. By cultivating these qualities, you can foster greater respect for the rich diversity that defines our global society."},{"question":"Given the question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin.

In a speech on Monday devoid of policy details or specifics, the Republican nominee called for the “extreme vetting” of immigrants, including a screening process to root out applicants who do not uphold “American values”. Laurence Tribe, a liberal constitutional law professor at Harvard University, said Trump’s proposal was “a nonstarter”. “The proposal ... is very deeply un-American, is probably unconstitutional, would almost certainly fail in Congress and is another example of Trump having no idea what he’s talking about,” he said. Restricting immigrants on the basis of ideology is anathema to American values, Tribe argues. Freedom of speech and religion are enshrined under the first amendment of the constitution and the enduring symbol of freedom is the Statue of Liberty welcoming weary immigrants to its shores. Related: McCarthyism redux: the long view of Trump's immigration plan | James Nevius Though immigrants outside the US would not receive the constitutional right to due process, Tribe said family members could bring challenges on their relatives’ behalves. Trump has long called for tightening immigration controls as part of his plan to defeat Islamic State. In 2015, Trump vowed to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US. In his speech on Monday, Trump appeared to revise that policy, calling for a temporary ban on immigrants from countries subject to terrorist attacks, though the original blanket ban on Muslims is still featured on his website. Trump’s proposal is not unprecedented. America has a long history of extreme vetting – which includes ideological tests – dating back to its foundation, when the leaders of the young nation worried anarchists would arrive and undermine the fledgling democracy. One of the earliest and most flagrant immigration laws was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which barred Chinese workers from entering the US. The ban, which was passed amid anxiety over job scarcity and a depressed economy, was later extended at the turn of the 20th century to in effect deny entry to all Asian immigrants. But Trump’s proposal draws from more recent history – the anti-communism measures employed during the cold war. “In the cold war, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,” he said during a speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio. “I call it extreme vetting.” In 1952, Congress passed the McCarran–Walter Act, authorizing the federal government to refuse admission to classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs in an effort to keep members, former members and sympathizers of the communist party from entering the US. As the cold war came to a close, Congress revisited the law and in 1990 voted to greatly narrow the president’s ability to deny immigrant visas based on ideological grounds. Trump has claimed, citing the act, that he would have the authority as president to suspend entry to any class of person who would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States”. While the law grants the executive branch broad discretion over matters of immigration, the president would not have “absolute” authority – Congress could act to limit the president’s power. And yet if Trump managed to clear the initial hurdles and his proposal either passed Congress or survived the legal challenges experts say would surely arise, he would then have to contend with the operational difficulties of implementing such a sweeping proposal. “If he does try to implement an ideological test, that leads to a question which came up early in the cold war: how do you administer that? Is that a questionnaire? Do you investigate the answers? And if you do, how do you do that? Who does that?” said Carl Bon Tempo, author of Americans at the Gate: The United States and Refugees during the Cold War. “Enforcing an ideological litmus test takes an incredible amount of manpower and historically the result has been that it greatly slows the process.” Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University, is skeptical of Trump’s promise to enhance a process that is already extensive and lengthy. Immigrants applying to come to the US are already asked to respond to a questionnaire and are subject to a background check that vets for, among other things, links to terrorist or extremist groups. How is a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently ‘American’ in his or her thinking? “Immigration to the United States would grind to a near halt if millions of people are subject to background checks based on subjective criteria,” he said. “How is a consular officer or a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently ‘American’ in his or her thinking?” Based on Trump’s speech on Monday, Yale-Loehr speculated that the Republican might propose screening applicants’ social media pages as part of the routine background check. Currently, officials only run social media checks in certain cases. He could also add requirements that family members be brought in for interviews as part of the application process. But he said it would be impossible to implement these changes, since they would require a vast mobilization of resources and manpower. Trump’s campaign has said it would expand on his immigration proposals in the coming weeks, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Still, experts say that on its surface, the proposal poses major logistical and practical problems that agencies grappled with during the cold war in the 1950s and, more recently, in the post-9/11 years. In vilifying the immigrant, Trump is using a familiar playbook from American history, said Erika Lee, a professor of immigration history at the University of Minnesota. Throughout history, politicians exploited public anxiety over a scarcity of jobs and threats to national security to push through exclusionary laws. “For many Americans, when they think back to America’s history, it’s the Ellis Island story. This is the way our mythology works,” Lee said. “But that has created some rose-colored glasses and helped to obscure the other side of the story, the one where we exclude whole groups of people based on race, ethnicity or ideological belief.” Summary:","response":"In a speech on Monday, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, suggested that the US should apply extreme vetting for immigrants, including a screening process to encourage those who do not uphold \\"American values\\", a move that legal experts argue raises significant constitutional concerns, according to The Guardian.

His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcÃ©.

China has its own holidays, such as the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Day, so we don't have to celebrate holidays from other countries. Some people spend a lot of money celebrating Christmas Day.

Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182; pronounced \\"blink one eighty two\\") is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number \\"-182\\". Hoppus and Barker decided to continue on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to \\"fill in\\" for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so he was the first and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend \\"18 hours\\" in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. \\"We all wanted to write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music,\\" said Hoppus. Upon its July 2016 release, California became the band's second number-one album on the Billboard 200, and first in 15 years; it also reached the top for the first time in the United Kingdom. Its lead single, \\"Bored to Death\\", became the group's first number one single in 12 years. The band supported the album with a large headlining tour across North America between July and October 2016, and a European leg in June and July 2017. A deluxe edition of California--essentially a double album including songs left off the original album--was issued in 2017. California earned the band their first nomination for Best Rock Album at the Grammy Awards. Critical reviews of the album, however, were mixed; many considered Feldmann's input and the throwback nature of the songs as formulaic. Recently, the band has taken time off and are preparing to record their eighth studio album. \\"Somehow, Blink has had this resurgence like we never expected,\\" Hoppus told Kerrang! in July 2017. \\"I count myself lucky to have been [playing in the band] as long as I have.\\" The band signed a 16-date residency deal with the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The shows, known as \\"Kings of the Weekend,\\" will take place on select weekends beginning May 26, 2018.

Hilary Freeman. When I introduced my boyfriend Mickael to my father, I desperately hoped they’d get on. I feared my dad might take umbrage at his modest job as a hotel receptionist, or his thick French accent — but I could never have predicted what actually set him off: Mickael’s looks. ‘He’s very handsome,’ said Dad. ‘Are you sure he’s faithful to you?’ This was three years ago and Mickael and I were in a long-distance relationship at the time. I lived in London, he was 650 miles away in Nice, and my father simply couldn’t accept that ‘someone as good-looking as Mickael’ wouldn’t be cheating on me at every opportunity. Hot topic: Hilary and 'Le Hunk' Mickael. I was devastated that he could say something so insensitive, and offended because I was very aware he wouldn’t have said it had my boyfriend looked like John Major. A wave of insecurity flooded over me. What did Mickael, now 38 see in a diminutive, curly-haired specimen like me? At 6ft 2in tall, with broad shoulders, black hair, a Roman nose and incredible blue eyes, Mickael is the living embodiment of tall, dark and handsome. He isn’t just good-looking, he’s movie-star handsome. At college, he was picked to play Rhett Butler in a Gone With The Wind adaptation and he’s been approached by model scouts wanting to sign him up. I know I sound smug, but bear with me. Because having a handsome boyfriend isn’t all it is cracked up to be. As I’ve learned to my cost, people make assumptions about good-looking men. Most of them, in my experience, are false and offensive. Just as blonde women are pigeon-holed as being stupid, handsome men are written off as lacking moral fibre. Most people assume they can’t be trusted around the opposite sex. They are also assumed to be shallow, vain and sex-obsessed. As a drop-dead gorgeous man’s girlfriend you have to be tough. You need a thick skin, high self-esteem and the ability not to care what other people think. Unfortunately for me, I possess none of these qualities. To paraphrase the 18th-century novelist, Samuel Richardson: ‘Handsome boyfriends often make a girlfriend’s heart ache.’ Mickael constantly tells Hilary shes pretty and says all his friends and family think so, too. He even loves her 'gappy teeth and big nose' Especially if said girlfriend is 42, 5ft 3in, with a big nose, hair that’s prone to frizz and gappy teeth. I’ve never had a problem attracting men, but I’m not conventionally beautiful and certainly not leading-lady material — unless that leading lady is Barbra Streisand. In a romcom, I’d be the kooky best friend, not the girl who gets the guy. If I were to award myself marks out of ten, I’d be a six — six-and-a-half on a good-hair day. Mickael would be a nine. In other words, he’s ‘out of my league’. But he doesn’t seem to care. More important to us is the silly sense of humour we share that can have us both in fits for hours. He constantly tells me I’m pretty and says all his friends and family think so, too. He even loves my gappy teeth and big nose. Now, that should be enough shouldn’t it? And, most of the time, it is. I know, without a doubt, that Mickael loves me. We’ve been through a lot together, including the stillbirth of our daughter 18 months ago. He’s given up his job at a hotel in Nice, his friends and his home country, and moved to London to live with me in Camden Town. So I know I shouldn’t feel insecure. Yet I often do. Men who feel they've 'lucked out' by marrying attractive women are more likely to care about their wives' needs, says a US study. We live in a shallow, looks-obsessed society, in which being beautiful is the most valuable currency. People stare at us in the street and — call me paranoid — I can tell that some of them are wondering what someone so handsome is doing with ordinary little me. Through the grapevine, I’ve heard reports of acquaintances making nasty, jealous comments about us, such as: ‘She’s punching above her weight.’ Although all of my previous partners have been attractive in my eyes, until Mickael I’d never had a partner universally considered handsome. Everyone, from friends — both straight and gay — to my 95-year-old grandma, has commented on his good looks. Friends have even nicknamed him ‘Le Hunk’. Several have even sent me emails — usually drunken — which begin: ‘I know this is probably really inappropriate, but can I just say that your boyfriend is really hot.’ Sometimes this makes me feel like I’m the owner of a prize bull at the county fair. People have actually congratulated me on my ‘achievement’, as though snaring a good-looking man is like winning an award, or gaining a promotion. Pleasing as it is that other people appreciate my good taste and good fortune, all this hyperbole means I’m only too aware that if our relationship were ever to go wrong, there would be a long queue of women ready to take my place. I’m not naturally jealous, but it’s hard not to look over my shoulder.And then there are Mickael’s beautiful exes who, through no fault of their own, make me feel inferior. At least two of his ex-girlfriends have modelled. He’s still good friends with one of them: a tall, sexy, willowy girl, ten years my junior, with thighs the size of my arms and men trailing in her wake wherever she goes. ‘I’m with you, not her,’ Mickael pointed out, when in a moment of weakness I confessed my sense of inadequacy. And that is true. But sometimes — usually when I’m contemplating my cellulite or finding a new grey hair — I can’t help wondering why a man who could have someone like her would want someone like me. Hilary says: 'Several have even sent me emails - usually drunken - which begin: 'I know this is probably really inappropriate, but can I just say that your boyfriend is really hot' I also worry more than I should — or ever have before — about getting fat, developing wrinkles and becoming middle-aged. Mickael reassures me by saying how much he loves my eyes and my smile, and reminding me that he can’t keep his hands off me. He talks of growing old with me and I know that, being French, he thinks older women can be just as attractive as younger ones. Supermodels aren’t even to his taste — he finds the majority superficial and lacking in character. To state the obvious, a good-looking man is no different from any other man, and a handsome face and a good character aren’t mutually exclusive. As I pointed out to my dad, just because good looks afford you more opportunities to cheat, it doesn’t mean that you’ll take them. If anything, I think the opposite is true. When you are attractive, and you can have pretty much anyone you want, there’s less motivation to do so. In my experience, it’s the insecure men, the ones who aren’t confident in themselves or their looks, who need to chat up women in order to prove their own self-worth. That’s why so many balding, paunchy men have mid-life crises and go after younger women. Mickael knows he’s handsome, but he isn’t arrogant, or vain. He cares about his appearance, but isn’t obsessed with it. He has the confidence and self-assurance of someone who has never had to try too hard. Believe it or not, he tells me he’s never actively chatted anyone up and can only remember one occasion when he was rejected by a woman. If he likes someone, and they’re single, it usually goes without saying they will like him back. The downside is that he’s been sexually harassed by strange women in bars (one thought it was fine to stroke him, without even saying hello first), and he often has to fend off the attentions of men, too. Being handsome can be dangerous. Mickael spent a week in hospital, and still has a pin in his jaw, after being punched — from behind — by a man who took offence when he made polite smalltalk with the man’s girlfriend. In some workplaces, he has been met with cold, aggressive behaviour from other guys. One colleague told him: ‘If I had a face like yours, I’d keep my mouth shut.’ A former friend admitted he liked going out with Mickael, not so much because he enjoyed his company, but because it helped him to pull women. As a friendly, loyal and sociable person, Mickael finds these attitudes hard to deal with — and so do I. But it might not be a problem for too much longer. Even movie star looks fade. As he nears the end of his 30s, he has started to sprout random hairs from his ears, is growing wayward, Denis Healey eyebrows, and he is battling against the development of the family double chin. He is near-sighted, suffers from a bad back and his love for French food and wine means that he doesn’t have anything resembling a six pack. And for these flaws, I am truly thankful. The fact is I don’t love Mickael because he’s handsome, although it doesn’t hurt. I love him because he’s funny, kind and thoughtful. It’s when I’m lying in his arms, in the dark — when I can’t see him — that I am at my most content. As the old proverb goes: ‘Handsome is as handsome does.’ I am absolutely certain that if he lost his looks tomorrow, I’d love him as much as ever.

The woman opted to ride the bus instead of the train because the","response":"The woman opted to ride the bus instead of the train because the bus stopped closer to her office. This decision was based on a variety of factors that she had carefully considered in order to make her daily commute as efficient and comfortable as possible. First and foremost, the proximity of the bus stop to her office provided her with an unmatched level of convenience. By choosing to utilize the bus service, she was able to save precious time and energy as the walking distance from the bus stop to her workplace was significantly shorter compared to that from the train station. This was especially important during inclement weather, when traveling on foot can be uncomfortable, or even dangerous due to slippery or icy conditions. Another important consideration for her choice was the fact that the bus route was less crowded than the train. In general, buses tend to provide a more relaxed and enjoyable travel experience due to the availability of seating and the reduced number of commuters. This meant that she could enjoy a more peaceful ride to and from work while being able to comfortably read a book, catch up on her emails, or simply use the time to mentally prepare for the day ahead. Additionally, buses often run at more frequent intervals throughout the day compared to trains. This provided her with greater flexibility in terms of her schedule, which was a significant advantage as she was able to better manage her time both before and after work, attending to personal errands or adjusting her hours if she needed to stay late at the office. Moreover, the bus service provided a more cost-effective solution for her transportation needs. The fare for the bus was less expensive than the train fare, which allowed her to save money on a daily basis. This financial aspect was yet another important factor that influenced her decision to ride the bus instead of the train. Lastly, taking the bus allowed her to explore her local surroundings and observe aspects of the city that she would have otherwise missed had she opted for the train. By engaging in this form of transportation, she was able to enjoy the ever-changing landscape and view points of interest along the bus route, creating a richer and more stimulating experience. Overall, the woman's choice to ride the bus instead of the train was primarily due to the convenient location of the bus stop in relation to her office. However, her decision was further reinforced by the multitude of additional benefits that the bus service provided over its rail counterpart, such as a less crowded and more comfortable commuting experience, greater scheduling flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and exposure to the local scenery."},{"question":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Mr. Leibovitz says the first prime minister of the Chinese Republic completed this program. And so did the first engineer to build a large-scale railroad without foreign help. The same was true of the fathers of Chinese education, diplomacy and the Navy. The book-writers had only to open some boxes containing the writings of these men to learn about them.

The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion.

Kyle drives the car much better and calmer than Kevin because","response":"Kyle had always been a cautious and calculated individual. From a young age, he prided himself on his ability to remain calm and level-headed in any situation. This personality trait naturally translated to his driving habits as well. When he first acquired his driver's license, Kyle made sure to enroll in a defensive driving course and study extensively to understand the rules of the road and various traffic situations that could arise. In contrast, Kevin was an impulsive and impatient individual, which often led to aggressive driving habits. He displayed an insatiable need for speed and took risks while driving that unnerved his passengers. Kevin sought to challenge himself and push the limits of both his car and his driving skills, often leading to reckless behavior and endangering everyone around him. Kyle's calm demeanor lent itself well to his driving; he kept a keen eye on the road ahead and consistently adapted his speed and positioning to account for changes in traffic conditions and potential hazards. His ultimate goal was to ensure that he and his passengers reached their destination safely, and he took the responsibility of driving seriously. He incorporated techniques from his defensive driving course, such as scanning intersections for oncoming traffic, leaving a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of him, and always signaling lane changes and turns well in advance to inform other drivers of his intentions. Furthermore, due to his patient nature, Kyle considered other drivers on the road and their safety. He gave way to pedestrians, always checked his blind spots, and willingly pulled over to let emergency vehicles pass. These consistent and thoughtful actions contributed to a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere inside Kyle's car that allowed passengers to trust in his capability and judgment as a driver. Kevin, on the other hand, would often succumb to road rage at the slightest inconvenience – honking at other drivers for trivial reasons, tailgating, or even weaving through traffic to overtake other vehicles. The passengers in his car were often on edge as they clung onto their seats, tensely anticipating Kevin's next unpredictable maneuver. Unfortunately, this temperament led to numerous traffic violations and even a couple of close calls with accidents. Kevin seemed oblivious to the potential consequences of his impulsive actions, cavalier in his belief that his superior driving skills would always ensure a close escape. Over time, Kyle and Kevin's friends and family came to recognize the stark difference in these two drivers' abilities and behaviors on the road. They began to voice their concerns about riding in a car with Kevin and would often arrange alternate transportation or make excuses to avoid getting into a vehicle with him. In contrast, they appreciated and respected Kyle's focus on safety, smooth driving, and his willingness to accommodate their needs and preferences, making him the undisputed driver of choice amongst their social circle. What distinguished Kyle from his brother was a combination of education, practice, and the temperament to treat driving responsibly. For Kyle, driving was not merely a means to get from point A to point B, but an opportunity to demonstrate his self-discipline, respect for others, and dedication to the safety of those around him. As Kevin continued on his reckless path, those close to him hoped he would learn from his brother's example, thus avoiding any life-altering consequences from his dangerous driving habits."},{"question":"Question: Where does June tell Mill that Kahane is at?

Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics).

The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. The original Broadway production opened at the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. Sedated with morphine, he could see only part of the stage. As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. Rodgers' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears. The original production ran for 890 performances, closing on May 24, 1947. The original cast included John Raitt (Billy), Jan Clayton (Julie), Jean Darling (Carrie), Eric Mattson (Enoch Snow), Christine Johnson (Nettie Fowler), Murvyn Vye (Jigger), Bambi Linn (Louise) and Russell Collins (Starkeeper). In December 1945, Clayton left to star in the Broadway revival of Show Boat and was replaced by Iva Withers; Raitt was replaced by Henry Michel in January 1947; Darling was replaced by Margot Moser. After closing on Broadway, the show went on a national tour for two years. It played for five months in Chicago alone, visited twenty states and two Canadian cities, covered 15,000 miles (24,000 km) and played to nearly two million people. The touring company had a four-week run at New York City Center in January 1949. Following the City Center run, the show was moved back to the Majestic Theatre in the hopes of filling the theatre until South Pacific opened in early April. However, ticket sales were mediocre, and the show closed almost a month early. The musical premiered in the West End, London, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on June 7, 1950. The production was restaged by Jerome Whyte, with a cast that included Stephen Douglass (Billy), Iva Withers (Julie) and Margot Moser (Carrie). Carousel ran in London for 566 performances, remaining there for over a year and a half.

He was the scourge of Democratic Representative \\"Boss\\" Tweed and the Tammany Hall Democratic party political machine. In 1890, Nast published Thomas Nast's Christmas Drawings for the Human Race. He contributed cartoons in various publications, notably the Illustrated American, but was unable to regain his earlier popularity. His mode of cartooning had come to be seen as outdated, and a more relaxed style exemplified by the work of Joseph Keppler was in vogue. Health problems, which included pain in his hands which had troubled him since the 1870s, affected his ability to work. In 1892, he took control of a failing magazine, the New York Gazette, and renamed it Nast's Weekly. Now returned to the Republican fold, Nast used the Weekly as a vehicle for his cartoons supporting Benjamin Harrison for president. The magazine had little impact and ceased publication seven months after it began, shortly after Harrison's defeat. The failure of Nast's Weekly left Nast with few financial resources. He received a few commissions for oil paintings and drew book illustrations. In 1902, he applied for a job in the State Department, hoping to secure a consular position in western Europe. Although no such position was available, President Theodore Roosevelt was an admirer of the artist and offered him an appointment as the United States' Consul General to Guayaquil, Ecuador in South America. Nast accepted the position and traveled to Ecuador on July 1, 1902. During a subsequent yellow fever outbreak, Nast remained on the job, helping numerous diplomatic missions and businesses escape the contagion. He contracted the disease and died on December 7 of that year. His body was returned to the United States, where he was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Where was he working?","response":"Thomas Nast was working as the United States' Consul General to Guayaquil, Ecuador in South America when he contracted yellow fever and died."},{"question":"Question: North Korea’s release of three U.S. citizens may help pave the way for talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, but questions remain as to whether those talks will succeed. At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting. The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. Question: after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners? Options: - Probably Pyongyang only takes 1 or 2 more prisoners - Probably Pyongyang stops taking prisoners - Probably Pyongyang continues to take many prisoners - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"Not enough information While it is difficult to predict the exact behavior of Pyongyang after the story ends, it is important to consider several factors that could influence their decision on whether to take more prisoners or not. These factors include: 1. The success of the Trump-Kim summit and the progress made in denuclearization talks: If the summit and the subsequent negotiations are successful in easing tensions between North Korea and the United States, it is possible that Pyongyang may refrain from taking more American prisoners as a means to maintain goodwill and avoid provoking any negative reactions from the U.S. 2. North Korea's internal politics and decision-making processes: The actions of the North Korean government, particularly those related to foreign policy, can be highly unpredictable. It may be challenging to glean reliable insight into the motivations of the regime, even after considering the release of prisoners and the conduct of high-level talks. 3. Developments in U.S.-North Korea relations beyond the scope of the story: Even if the summit and negotiations are initially successful, the future course of U.S.-North Korea relations may be influenced by a variety of factors, such as changes in political leadership, unforeseen crises, or the situations in South Korea and China. 4. The behavior of American citizens visiting North Korea: While it is unlikely that U.S. citizens would deliberately engage in activities that would result in their arrest and detainment, it is possible that inadvertent actions or misunderstandings could lead to future instances of North Korea taking American citizens into custody. Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively determine which of the provided options is most likely. As such, \\"not enough information\\" is the most accurate answer, as it acknowledges the uncertainty and complexity of the situation in predicting the future actions of Pyongyang."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the question \\"Why does the girl suggest that her father buy a new car too?\\" and the answer \\"Their current car is in bad shape, and it doesn't look good.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"To hold your breath effectively, follow these steps: 1. Find a comfortable position: Stand, sit, or lay down in a comfortable position to ensure that your breathing remains stable and uninterrupted. 2. Take a deep breath: Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs with air. Focus on expanding your chest and diaphragm, ensuring you are taking in as much air as possible. 3. Close both your mouth and nostrils: Once you have filled your lungs with air, close your mouth and pinch your nostrils together with your thumb and index finger. This step prevents any air from escaping. 4. Set a mental timer: As you begin holding your breath, set a mental timer or count the seconds in your mind. This helps you keep track of the duration and maintain focus on holding your breath. 5. Stay relaxed: As you hold your breath, try to remain calm and composed. This allows your body to perform better under reduced oxygen conditions. 6. Release your breath when necessary: When you feel the urge to breathe, slowly let the air out of your lungs through your mouth. It's essential to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard in holding your breath. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal depends on the context. If you're looking for a straightforward technique for holding your breath, the steps mentioned above should suffice.

In case you missed it, the Democrats really, really believe in reproductive freedom.

To burn fat, it's important to get as much exercise as you can. Most people, however, don't have time to visit the gym every day. So, look for places in your daily routine where you can burn a few extra calories. Every little bit helps! If your work allows it, walk around while you're doing things in the office. Take a walk on your lunch break.Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Bike to the office. Look at yard work as an opportunity to get some extra exercise in. Whatever works for you is fine, as long as it gets you to spend less time sitting and more time moving. The specialized equipment that gyms have will let you get more out of your workouts than you could just running around the block. Many gyms also offer classes or individual training programs to help you stay motivated. Visit as often as you can, and try to get in a routine. Three days a week is a great goal if you have time. Core exercises like crunches are great for building up your abdominal muscles, but to burn up the fat underneath, you'll need to cardiovascular workouts like running, bicycling, swimming, etc. Anything that gets your heart rate up is burning calories. Keep up the pace. While any cardiovascular workout will burn calories, a high-intensity, fast paced workout will cause the release of growth hormones, which trigger the use of fat cells as fuel, and raise your metabolism for hours after the workout is over, extending the fat burn. Lifting weights and similar strength training not only builds muscle and burns fat, it also improves your sensitivity to insulin, helping your body process glucose more efficiently and store less of it as fat. Mix up which areas you are exercising, alternating between upper- and lower-body exercises. This will allow you to exercise all your muscles efficiently, without as much downtime in between sets. Try to target high intensity activity before low intensity activity and repeat a number of times during your workout. This will insure you maximize fat burn by following the biological sequence. You can get the most out of your weight training and cardiovascular workouts if you mix them up as well. Some studies have suggested that doing some lifting a few minutes before a jog or bicycle ride will increase the calories you burn during the cardiovascular workout. Some people suggest interspersing short bursts of cardiovascular exercise throughout a strength training workout. For example, you can set down the weights to do sprints after 15 minutes of lifting, then return to your weights for another 15 minutes, and so on. Don't start too heavy. Lift weights that you can pick up comfortably, without straining yourself too much, and work your way up to larger weights. Otherwise, you may hurt yourself. Intervals are exercise routines that involve periods of intense exercise, followed by short rest periods. By keeping the level of intensity high, your body is forced to burn more oxygen than it takes in. To compensate, your metabolism will increase and remain high for a period after your workout is complete, so that your body can assimilate a greater amount of oxygen. Like a high-speed cardiovascular workout, this helps keep the fat burning going after the workout ends. The most effective interval activities are those that exercise the whole body in a single exercise, like jumping jacks, lunges, hitting a tire with sledgehammer, and jumping rope. All of these should be done as quickly as possible. After a few minutes of activity, take a one minute rest, then do another interval. Once you've been doing a general exercise routine for a few weeks, you'll probably notice some areas of your body are shedding fat (or developing muscle) faster or more easily than others. At this point, it's a good idea to develop specialized routines to focus on the areas where the fat is taking longer to burn away. Some people find it's even a good idea to dedicate different days of the week to exercising certain areas. For example: Monday, focus on your arms and chest, on Tuesday, focus on your core, and on Wednesday, focus on your back and legs. Keeping to regular exercise regimen takes a lot of willpower, but to burn the fat and keep it off, you have to keep exercising and keep eating right. Summary:","response":"This article emphasizes the importance of incorporating exercise into daily routines, utilizing gym facilities, mixing weight training and cardiovascular workouts, following high-intensity activities, and maintaining a consistent regimen to effectively burn fat and improve overall health."},{"question":"Options: -negative. -positive. Short movie review: endure instead of enjoy Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"Based on the given short movie review, \\"endure instead of enjoy,\\" it is evident that the critic was thinking negatively of the movie. Let me provide a more detailed analysis of the statement and its negative connotation. The verb \\"endure\\" refers to tolerating, bearing, or suffering something, typically an unpleasant or difficult circumstance. This term suggests that the critic had to bear with the movie's content or elements rather than genuinely deriving pleasure from it. This sentiment insinuates that the movie might have had several flaws or weaknesses, making it a bothersome viewing experience for the critic. On the other hand, the verb \\"enjoy\\" implies experiencing pleasure, satisfaction, or appreciation. By stating \\"endure instead of enjoy,\\" the critic highlights that the movie failed to evoke positive emotions or entertain effectively. This expectation indicates that the critic did not find the movie stimulating, thought-provoking, or gratifying in any manner. Moreover, the word \\"instead\\" further enhances the negative evaluation of the movie. It contrasts the two opposing actions – enduring versus enjoying – and reinforces the idea that the critic could only withstand the movie, rather than savor it. So, it can be inferred that the critic indeed thought negatively of the movie. In summary, based on the short movie review provided, the critic was thinking negatively about the movie. The use of the verb \\"endure,\\" as opposed to \\"enjoy,\\" underscores dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction, implying the movie was not an enjoyable or pleasurable experience."},{"question":"Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

Q: It sounds like I'm the asshole but hear me out. I became friends with this silent girl when I first started the university. Let's call her Susan. It was the first year, so we made different friends at the end of the year. However her friend failed the class and she started to sit near me in the classroom again. I introduced her to my close friend, let's call her Jane, and we started to hang out as a trio. I and Jane were both talkative, so when all of us were together we were making the most of the conversations. Susan was still silent. We tried to make her talk. She should be talking with us at least. Because we told everything about our lives to her but we barely knew her. It wasn't fair. A lot of things happened but let's fast-forward to the last year. We had a thesis and we had to read articles in English, because there was no research that was done in our country about that subject. Yet Susan was not helping. She was always saying: \\"your English is better than mine, I can't understand the articles\\". She was not even trying. I could speak English but I also didn't understand articles at the beginning. With reading a lot, Jane and I started to be more competent about the subject we were working on. Our professor was delighted but she wasn't seeing Susan's lack of effort. Moreover, she wasn't listening us when we were talking even in daily things like what we should eat when we get home. She was always on her phone and it was driving us crazy. Long story to short, we were *close* friends but she never shared anything about her life or her thoughts, never did anything that she didn't want to, even if that means we would have to do her parts in the projects, never listened us enough to care. And we were *close* but when I had some tough times, she didn't even call even though she knew and that was the final straw. I ended our friendship. I know shy people struggle to communicate but I don't think she's that shy. I think she's just using her shyness as an excuse.

Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the “self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response. The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with the cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the membrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down cellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones or neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell. Some recognition sites are used by viruses as attachment points.

Originally a trio , the group eventually became a duo including Yarimar Huertas and Yalixia Figueroa . - Reggaeton (also known as reggaetón and reguetón) is a musical genre which originated in Puerto Rico during the late 1990s. It is influenced by hip hop and Latin American and Caribbean music. Vocals include rapping and singing, typically in Spanish. - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Rapping (or emceeing, MCing, or rhyming) is \\"spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics\\". The components of rapping include \\"content\\", \\"flow\\" (rhythm and rhyme), and \\"delivery\\". Rapping is distinct from spoken-word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat (external meter). Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon can be said to predate hip-hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake, Gorillaz and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is composed of hip-hop elements. Another form of rap that predates hip hop was Muhammad Ali's rhythmic poetry used to taunt his opponents in the 1960s and 1970s. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.

Yes or no? Answer: A total of 4,486 U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2012. Question: how many US soldiers killed in Iraq war A:","response":"Yes, the statement \\"A total of 4,486 U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2012\\" is a correct answer to the question \\"how many US soldiers killed in Iraq war.\\" The Iraq War, which began with the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003 and officially ended in December 2011, witnessed the deployment of U.S. forces for nearly a decade. During this time, the United States aimed to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, end Saddam Hussein's regime, and establish a functional democratic government in the country. Throughout the course of the war, U.S. troops were involved in various operations such as Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003-2010) and Operation New Dawn (2010-2011). These operations contributed significantly to the overall mission in Iraq, but they also came at a high cost in terms of human lives. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the number of U.S. military personnel who died in Iraq between 2003 and 2012 is 4,486. This figure includes those who died as a direct result of hostile action, as well as non-hostile deaths, such as accidents, illnesses, suicides, or other causes not related to combat. Many of these soldiers were killed or injured by IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices), which were one of the largest threats to U.S. forces during the war. Moreover, the war in Iraq also had a massive impact on the local population, with estimates of civilian deaths ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Apart from casualties, the conflict had other long-lasting repercussions, including widespread displacement of civilians, economic hardship, and environmental damage. In addition to the U.S. troops, the Iraq War saw the involvement of other coalition forces and Iraqi security forces as well. Their casualties, when taken into account, further add to the grim picture of the human cost of the war. In summary, the assertion that 4,486 U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2012 is accurate, illustrating the immense human toll of the conflict on the U.S. military personnel."},{"question":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Researchers raised baby mice from birth to weaning in either \\"summer\\" light cycles of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark or \\"winter\\" cycles of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of dark. A third group experienced 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day. Then half the winter mice stayed in a winter cycle, while half switched to a summer schedule. The summer mice were similarly _ . The mice raised in equal periods of light and dark were split into three groups, one of which stayed on the 12hour schedule, one of which joined the winter group, and one of which joined the summer group. After 28 days, it turns out the summerborn mice behaved the same whether they stayed on the summer cycle or switched to winter. But among the winterborn mice, those stayed in winter kept their previous schedule, while those that switched to summer stayed active for an extra hour and a half, which indicates that mice born and weaned in a winter light cycle showed dramatic disruptions in their biological clocks. The finding is the first of its kind in mammals, and it could explain why people born in winter are at higher risk for mental health disorders including bipolar depression, schizophrenia and seasonal affective disorder. \\"We know that the biological clock regulates mood in humans,\\"said study researcher McMahon. \\"If the mechanism similar to the one that we found in mice operates in humans, then it could not only have an effect on a number of behavioral disorders, but also have a more general effect on personality.\\" Options: A A jobhunter.

It's not 4 me.","response":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet by @Shannyn808, we need to first understand what the tweet is about, and then analyze the emotions and attitudes that are conveyed through the text. First, the context: The tweet references \\"140 mafia,\\" which could potentially refer to a group or organization associated with Twitter due to the number 140 (Twitter's original character limit for tweets). It is unclear exactly what \\"140 mafia\\" represents, and this might make a significant difference in interpreting the sentiment of the tweet. From the text, it appears that the user is asking if this group or organization is working for someone else and mentions that it's not working for them. To analyze the sentiment of the tweet, we can break it down into several components: 1. \\"@Shannyn808\\" - The mention of a specific user suggests that the tweeter is directly addressing someone, likely seeking their opinion on the matter. The sentiment here could be seen as neutral or slightly inquisitive. 2. \\"Is 140 mafia working 4 u?\\" - The wording \\"working 4 u\\" implies that the tweeter is curious to know if this \\"140 mafia\\" is benefiting or serving the person they are addressing. In this context, the sentiment may be seen as inquisitive or even skeptical. 3. \\"It's not 4 me.\\" - This statement explicitly conveys a negative sentiment from the user, as they are saying that the \\"140 mafia\\" is not working for them. It could be interpreted as a degree of dissatisfaction, disappointment, or even frustration with the situation. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a combination of inquisitive, skeptical, and negative emotions. The tweeter appears to be seeking the opinion or experience of another user regarding the \\"140 mafia.\\" At the same time, they express their dissatisfaction with the fact that it's not working for them. The overall sentiment, therefore, leans more towards the negative side, as it conveys a sense of unhappiness with a situation and a search for validation from others who might have had a similar experience."},{"question":"Q: Given a trivia question, classify broad topical category from this list: 'theater', 'geology', 'book', 'tv', 'astronomy', 'aviation', 'military', 'government', 'boxing', 'projects', 'metropolitan_transit', 'law', 'venture_capital', 'broadcast', 'biology', 'people', 'influence', 'baseball', 'spaceflight', 'media_common', 'cvg', 'opera', 'olympics', 'chemistry', 'visual_art', 'conferences', 'sports', 'language', 'travel', 'location', 'award', 'dining', 'martial_arts', 'comic_strips', 'computer', 'user', 'tennis', 'music', 'organization', 'food', 'event', 'transportation', 'fictional_universe', 'measurement_unit', 'meteorology', 'distilled_spirits', 'symbols', 'architecture', 'freebase', 'internet', 'fashion', 'boats', 'cricket', 'film', 'medicine', 'finance', 'comic_books', 'celebrities', 'soccer', 'games', 'time', 'geography', 'interests', 'common', 'base', 'business', 'periodicals', 'royalty', 'education', 'type', 'religion', 'automotive', 'exhibitions'.

Tracey gets shot and is hospitalized in critical condition.Hatcher encounters a gangster named Jimmy Fingers (DiBenedetto) and unsuccessfully tries to get him to tell him where Screwface might be and is forced to kill him. Another Jamaican named Nesta (Evans) arrives and Hatcher is able to sit him down but Nesta tells him to go after Screwface alone and jumps out the window to his death. When asked what happened, John finds the blood symbol used by the Posse during the murders vandalized on a carpet the next day and gets information about it from a Jamaican voodoo and gang expert named Leslie (Pacula) who works part time as a detective.Hatcher comes out of retirement to join Max in a battle against Screwface. While John is in the detective's store, Melissa makes a phone call to him but is cut short when Screwface and his men invade into Hatcher's home and attempts to murder Melissa but they leave upon Hatcher's arrival.The next day, Hatcher and Max get into a fight with three of Screwface's henchmen during a car chase.

A logical system is possible but an existential system is not. \\"What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational\\".

For Kierkegaard, an existential system that claims to encompass all aspects of reality is impossible to achieve due to the inherent limitations of human understanding and our mortal nature. He emphasized that, while a logical system may be possible, a comprehensive existential system, as claimed by Hegel's idealism, is not. Therefore, according to Kierkegaard, there isn't a specific system or method that can explain all of reality. Instead, he focused on the importance of individual subjectivity, personal experience, and religious faith as ways to approach and engage with reality."},{"question":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Quills Movie plot: Quills begins in Paris during the Reign of Terror, with the incarcerated Marquis de Sade penning a story about the libidinous Mademoiselle Renard, a ravishing young aristocrat who meets the preeminent sadist in her executioner. Several years later, the Marquis is confined to the asylum for the insane at Charenton, overseen by the enlightened AbbÃ© du Coulmier. The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine \\"Maddy\\" LeClerc, who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman to a publisher.

The joke on the streets of Moscow is that the politicians took the bullet for the oligarchs, not for the first time and not the last. But jokes aside, the fate of Crimea is sealed. It will become part of Russia in about three months' time and, as things stand now, President Vladimir Putin has already signed an executive order recognizing the peninsula as an independent state, confirming his determination to stick to his guns in his address to the Federal Assembly. The Russian leader has gone way too far in his attempt to prevent Crimea -- with two thirds of its population made up of ethnic Russians -- from sliding into mayhem to pull back now, sanctions or no sanctions. It would have been political suicide for him to remain idle in the face of what had happened in Kiev last month. Most Western leaders obviously understood that, even though their rhetoric did not show it. In fact, most if not all Western leaders are probably thanking their lucky stars they have to deal with Mr Putin in the Kremlin and not some die-hard nationalist who would be dreaming of a revival of the former Soviet empire, flexing military muscles with frightening regularity. No-one wants Cold War. So, the so-called \\"smart sanctions,\\" which have been announced by Washington and Brussels in response to events in Crimea were an anti-climax and a confirmation of a total lack of any desire on the part of the West to take the fight with Russia any further. Sure, a bit of posturing and tough talking never hurt the opinion polls at home, but there are more important things than dragging out the dust covered Cold War from the cupboard and losing out on business deals, while having all that lovely Russian money flowing to the West dry up. The Cold War is very 1960s, you know, and no one really wants it to come back. The debate about the legality of the referendum in Crimea will ramble on for a while but it is very difficult to imagine how the result can now be reversed. From the Russian side of the fence, in case you're wondering, the plebiscite in Crimea was a logical response to the overthrow of the democratically elected regime of President Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev -- albeit with its incompetence and corruption -- and the country finding itself with a bunch of opportunists in charge and some pretty rough characters from the far-right acting as their enforcers, saying nasty things about Russia from the word go. No wonder then that Moscow shrugged all accusations that the Crimean referendum was illegal coming from Kiev and the West, saying: \\"Look who's talking!\\" At the moment, all the Kremlin officials and members of parliament mentioned in the lists provided by Washington and Brussels are putting on a brave face and saying that they see it as a privilege and an honor to be in them, pointing out that they don't keep any money or own any assets abroad. Not in their own names they don't, because about a year ago a law had been passed in Russia that no governments officials and members of parliament were allowed to have foreign accounts and own properties abroad. So a transformation of ownership had taken place and it would be pretty hard to figure out who owns what and where. And in case anyone is wondering how then politicians and the servants of the people generally keep their wealth hidden, be it in Russia or in the West, it's all about trusted people, \\"fixers,\\" handling it for them. Yes, yes, don't look surprised, democracy, both regulated and without boundaries, has its own well-tested system. Otherwise why would people go into politics at all? Getting personal. Privately some Russian officials are saying that all these lists represent a break with the old tradition of not getting personal during a row. \\"No one called for smart sanctions against specific yanks and Brits when they pulled off that invasion of Iraq,\\" one angry official in Moscow complained to me. \\"And no one was naming names when the war in Libya went all wrong.\\" Yes, getting personal in politics was always a taboo and this this round boundaries were crossed. So what now? Well, the noises will continue for a while, getting louder when Crimea joins Russia proper. Mind you, the situation may get more complicated if parts of eastern Ukraine start pushing hard for their on referendums on their future with Russia, like the one in Crimea. That is why it's now a good time for both the West and Russia to start finding the way out of this crisis. For everyone's sake. Read more: Putin vs. Obama face off over Crimea facts.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. D.

I put all my coins in a piggy bank instead of a coin purse because the","response":"piggy bank provides a more extensive and secure storage solution for long-term accumulation of savings, fostering a sense of financial discipline and responsibility, while also offering various other benefits. One of the primary reasons is that piggy banks tend to have a significantly larger capacity for holding coins than coin purses do. With the added space, individuals can accumulate more coins over a longer period of time, allowing for greater savings without the hassle of constantly emptying a smaller container such as a coin purse. The physical design of piggy banks also encourages money-saving habits. Typically, piggy banks have a small opening or slot through which coins can be inserted, but no easily accessible way to remove the money. Without the temptation of easily withdrawing coins, individuals are more likely to adhere to their savings goals and refrain from frivolously spending their hoarded currency. In contrast, coin purses offer immediate and convenient access to stored coins, enticing users to spend their money on impulse buys and diminishing their overall savings. Additionally, piggy banks can act as decorative accessories in one's living space, serving both a functional and aesthetic purpose. They come in a wide variety of shapes, colors, and materials, allowing them to be incorporated into different design schemes while also staying true to their original purpose as a savings aid. Piggy banks also have a nostalgic appeal for many individuals, as they remind them of their childhood and the early lessons of financial management. This connection to one's formative years can create a positive association with saving and encourage healthy financial habits in the future. Furthermore, piggy banks can serve as an excellent teaching tool for children, helping them understand the concept of saving and instilling the value of delayed gratification at a young age. Having a tangible and enjoyable means of saving coins can make it more likely that children will adopt the practice throughout their lives. Lastly, using a piggy bank can provide an added layer of security that a coin purse may lack. Because piggy banks are commonly kept at home, the chances of losing or misplacing them are significantly reduced compared to carrying a coin purse in a public setting where it can easily be lost or stolen. In conclusion, the choice to store coins in a piggy bank rather than a coin purse allows for greater storage capacity, encourages constructive saving habits and financial discipline, offers a diverse range of designs and nostalgic appeal, serves as an educational tool for children, and provides increased security. All of these factors combine to make piggy banks a preferred method of accumulating and safeguarding one's hard-earned coins."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

It is also sometimes called the School of Forms and Names. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Gongsun Long ( simplified Chinese : ; traditional Chinese : ; pinyin : Gngsn Lóng ; Wade -- Giles : Kung1 - sun1 Lung2 , c. 325 -- 250 BC ) was a member of the School of Names ( Logicians ) of ancient Chinese philosophy . He also ran a school and enjoyed the support of rulers , and advocated peaceful means of resolving disputes in contrast to the wars which were common in the Warring States period . However , little is known about the particulars of his life , and furthermore many of his writings have been lost . All of his essays -- fourteen originally but only six extant -- are included in the anthology the Gongsun Longzi ( Chinese : ; pinyin : Gngsn lóng zi ; Wade -- Giles : Kung - sun Lung - tzu ) . In Book 17 of the Zhuangzi anthology , Gongsun thus speaks of himself : When young , I studied the way of the former kings . When I grew up , I understood the practice of kindness and duty . I united the same and different , separated hard from white , made so the not - so and admissible the inadmissible . I confounded the wits of the hundred schools and exhausted the eloquence of countless speakers . I took myself to have reached the ultimate . He is best known for a series of paradoxes in the tradition of Hui Shi , including \`\` White horses are not horses , '' \`\` When no thing is not the pointed - out , to point out is not to point out , '' and \`\` There is no 1 in 2 . '' These paradoxes seem to suggest a similarity to the discovery in Greek philosophy that pure logic may lead to apparently absurd conclusions . - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors. - Confucianism, also known as Ruism, is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life. Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551479 BCE), who considered himself a retransmitter of the values of the Zhou dynasty golden age of several centuries before. In the Han dynasty (206 BCE 220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the \\"proto-Taoist\\" Huang-Lao, as the official ideology while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism. The disintegration of the Han political order in the second century CE opened the way for the doctrines of Buddhism and Neo-Taoism, which offered spiritual explanations lacking in Confucianism. - Chinese sovereign is the ruler of a particular period in ancient China. Several titles and naming schemes have been used throughout history. - An intellectual is a person who engages in critical thinking, research, and reflection about the reality of society, and proposes solutions for the normative problems of society, and thus he or she gains authority as a public intellectual. Coming from the world of culture, either as a creator or as a mediator, the intellectual participates in politics, either to defend a concrete proposition or to denounce an injustice, usually by producing or by extending an ideology, and by defending a system of values. - Sima Tan (c. 165 BC 110 BC) was an early Chinese historian who worked under the Western Han. He studied astronomy with Tang Du, the \\"I Ching\\" under Yang He, and Daoism under Master Huang. He held the position of Court Astrologer () between 140-110 BC. While Sima Tan had begun the \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\" (\\"Shiji\\"), he died before it was finished. It was left to his son, Sima Qian, to complete. The year of Sima Tan's death is the year of the great imperial sacrifice \\"fengshan\\" by Han Wudi, for which the emperor appointed the fangshi, leaving Sima behind and thus probably causing him much frustration. - Mohism or Moism (aka. Mohist School of Logic) was an ancient Chinese philosophy of logic, rational thought and science developed by the academic scholars who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c. 470 BCc. 391 BC). It evolved at about the same time as Confucianism, Taoism and Legalism, and was one of the four main philosophic schools from around 770221 BC (during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods). During that time, Mohism was seen as a major rival to Confucianism. The administrative thought of Mohism was absorbed by Chinese Legalism and its books were later merged into the Taoist canon, all but disappearing as an independent school of thought. - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states. - Sima Qian (; c. 145 or 13586 BC), formerly romanized Ssu-ma Chien, was a Chinese historian of the Han dynasty. He is considered the father of Chinese historiography for his \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\", a \\"Jizhuanti\\"-style (history presented in a series of biographies) general history of China, covering more than two thousand years from the Yellow Emperor to his time, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a work that had much influence for centuries afterwards on history-writing not only in China, but in Korea, Japan and Vietnam as well. Although he worked as the Court Astrologer (Chinese: ; \\"Tàish Lìng\\"), later generations refer to him as the Grand Historian (Chinese: ; Tàish Gng or tai-shih-kung) for his monumental work; a work which in later generations would often only be somewhat tacitly or glancingly acknowledged as an achievement only made possible by his acceptance and endurance of punitive actions against him, including imprisonment, castration, and subjection to servility. - Chinese philosophy originates in the Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period, during a period known as the \\"Hundred Schools of Thought\\", which was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments. Although much of Chinese philosophy begins in the Warring States period, elements of Chinese philosophy have existed for several thousand years; some can be found in the Yi Jing (the \\"Book of Changes\\"), an ancient compendium of divination, which dates back to at least 672 BCE. It was during the Warring States era that what Sima Tan termed the major philosophical schools of China, Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism, arose, along with philosophies that later fell into obscurity, like Agriculturalism, Mohism, Chinese Naturalism, and the Logicians. - In politics, a figurehead is a person who holds \\"de jure\\" (in name or by law) an important title or office (often supremely powerful), yet \\"de facto\\" (in reality) executes little actual power. The metaphor derives from the carved figurehead at the prow of a sailing ship. Commonly cited figureheads include Queen Elizabeth II, who is Queen of sixteen Commonwealth realms and head of the Commonwealth, but has no power over the nations in which she is not head of state and does not exercise power in her own realms on her own initiative. Other figureheads are the Emperor of Japan, the King of Sweden, or presidents in majority of parliamentary republics, such as the President of India, President of Israel, President of Bangladesh, President of Greece, President of Germany, President of Pakistan (starting in 2010), and President of China (without CPC General Secretary and Chairman of CMC posts).

If you want an example, consider that a Tesla driver in Utah recently found that his Model S loaner had parked itself automatically into the back of a trailer. After analyzing logs, the carmaker told him that he’s the only person to blame for the accident. Apparently, the car’s auto-parking feature was initiated, which is why the car hit the back of the trailer. DON’T MISS: Amazon’s 12 best daily deals: A 50 smartphone, a 150 smart TV, and plenty more The Summon feature is still in beta and requires human oversight. Tesla advises users to monitor the self-parking feature at all times and intervene to avoid obstacles that could cause accidents. The driver, Jared Overton, said that he did not activate the Summon feature and that he was near the vehicle for some 20 seconds talking about it with a nearby worker at the business he was visiting. Overton said he parked well behind the trailer, but the car somehow drove itself into it, failing to detect the trailer’s bed. Overton and the worker discovered the car a few minutes later when exiting the business. “We were trying to figure out how on earth the vehicle started on its own,” Overton told KSL. “What happened with this kind of rogue vehicle?” Tesla sent a letter to Overton telling him that it was practically his fault, suggesting he may have invoked the Summon feature and that he may have failed to monitor the car. “Tesla has reviewed the vehicle’s logs, which show that the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle’s surroundings while using the Summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times,” the letter said. The Summon feature “was initiated by a double-press of the gear selector stalk button, shifting from Drive to Park and requesting Summon activation” Tesla explained. It all happened three seconds after Overton exited the car and closed the door, the letter explained. The driver disagrees, saying that even if he accidentally started Summon, he would have been able to hear it and stop it. “Even during that 15, 20-second walk right here, we would have easily heard the impact of the vehicle into the back of the trailer,” Overton said. “They can tell me what they want to tell me with the logs, but it doesn’t change what we know happened here.” “They’re just assuming that I sat there and watched it happen, and I was OK with that,” Overton said. A Tesla spokesperson told KSL that the Summon feature is in beta, and each driver has to agree to certain terms and conditions before enabling it. These conditions say that the driver has to be in proximity of the car when using its autonomous features to be able to assume manual control if something goes wrong. “This feature will park Model S while the driver is outside the vehicle,” the statement said. “Please note that the vehicle may not detect certain obstacles, including those that are very narrow (e.g., bikes), lower than the fascia, or hanging from the ceiling. As such, Summon requires that you continually monitor your vehicle’s movement and surroundings while it is in progress and that you remain prepared to stop the vehicle at any time using your key fob or mobile app or by pressing any door handle. You must maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle when using this feature and should only use it on private property.” Overton said the statement practically dismissed the experience of two witnesses. “Imagine if a child was right there — I guarantee that they would be responding to this a lot differently,” Overton said. “I will not feel safe with my little boy playing in the garage or the driveway if there’s the potential for a rogue vehicle.” ||||| A Tesla owner in Utah says that he returned to his parked Model S to find that it had crept forward and crashed into the trailer parked ahead of it. The man claims that this all went down without explanation; Tesla refutes that claim, saying that after taking a look at the car's logs, it determined that the Summon feature had been activated, which autonomously calls the car to (or from) the waiting driver without anyone behind the wheel. The owner says that he was answering questions about the car from a passerby, so it's entirely possible that he opened the app and accidentally activated Summon (for what it's worth, he claims he didn't). But here's the thing: it doesn't matter. Under no circumstances should a production vehicle autonomously collide with a parked vehicle mere feet ahead of it. I think that's common sense, right? Am I saying anything controversial? As a refresher, here's Tesla's video explaining how Summon works: A letter to the owner from a regional Tesla service manager obtained by KSL says that \\"the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle's surroundings while using the Summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times.\\" Perhaps! But cars — by virtue of the fact that people of all walks of life and levels of attentiveness use them — are supposed to be far more bulletproof than this by the time they reach production. It's why the FCA just recalled over a million cars with confusing shift levers, because a driver who isn't paying attention could fail to put it in park. In other words, Summon — and similar features that will inevitably come from other manufacturers — can't rely on an attentive owner to keep the car from smashing into something. It's one of the reasons why Google and a half-dozen automakers are moving more slowly with commercial autonomous deployments. Tesla will be quick to note that Summon is \\"in beta,\\" but owners are going to use it either way, and unfortunately, we can't always expect them to use good judgement. We can't be required to be smarter than the software The notion of safety-critical \\"beta\\" software in deployment on commercial vehicles is a relatively new one, and it's something that regulatory agencies aren't equipped to deal with. I suspect that in a decade or two, there will be a well-established framework of tests that systems like Summon will have to pass before being allowed on a production car. But for now, it's the Wild West. In a statement to KSL, Tesla says that Summon \\"may not detect certain obstacles, including those that are very narrow (e.g., bikes), lower than the fascia, or hanging from the ceiling.\\" In this incident, the trailer is very high — it only comes as low as the midpoint of the Model S's windshield. But we've seen autonomous vehicles solve much harder problems than this (just watch any of Nvidia's keynotes on computer vision in self-driving cars from the past couple years). And coincidentally, the Model S is equipped with a forward-facing camera mounted at rear view mirror height. That is to say: \\"beta\\" or no, owner liability disclaimer or no, a car capable of autonomously crashing itself into a stationary object in normal operating conditions should never have been sold. Tested, yes — sold, no. We humans just aren't smart enough to handle something like that. Update May 11th 3:02PM ET: We saw the letter that Tesla sent to the vehicle's owner, which details what happened. You can read our full story here.

He is most widely known for his role as guitarist and vocalist for the post-metal band Isis, while also participating in several other bands and projects such as Old Man Gloom, Lotus Eaters and Split Cranium, a collaboration with Jussi Lehtisalo of Finnish band Circle who toured with Isis in 2009. Though raised in New Mexico, Turner moved to the Boston area where he attended school and formed Isis and Hydra Head. In June 2003, Turner moved operations of both the band and label to Los Angeles, California. Context: Touring with Isis in 2007, Turner used two different guitars: a 1976 Fender Telecaster Custom (black), and a 1975 Fender Telecaster Deluxe (brown), played through various effects (his pedalboard layout changed every gig depending on what songs the band decided to play that night), a VHT/Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, and two 4x12 Sunn cabinets. He has also acquired a custom guitar from the Electrical Guitar Company (as did fellow Isis guitarist Michael Gallagher). In the past, Turner has also used a Gibson Les Paul Standard, PRS CE24, and has played through Sunn, Mesa Boogie, and Mackie amplifiers. When playing with Isis, Turner and his fellow guitarists usually tuned their instruments (low to high) B-F#-B-E-G#-B, to achieve a heavier sound. They also used other tunings, though less frequently, such as F# (octave below)-F#-B-E-G#-B. In 2016, Turner described the live rig he used with SUMAC as consisting of two custom-built guitars from the Electrical Guitar Company. Both have lucite bodies and aluminum necks, and custom-wound wide frequency range pickups. The newer of the two--a prototype for a signature model--has a slightly flatter fingerboard radius than the older instrument. On a tour of the Eastern US, Turner was using an Orange Dual Dark 100 amplifier head with a slaved Fryette Two/Ninety/Two power amp. Both heads drove Orange and Marshall cabinets, though Turner claimed to have no strong preferences for particular speaker cabinets. While recording, Turner prefers to use a Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, an amp model he's used consistently since his work in Isis. Turner described using a variety of effects pedals in his live rig. Specifically, he runs a BOSS TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, a Death By Audio Apocalypse fuzz, a MASF fuzz, a Strymon BlueSky reverb (which he described as the one essential pedal in his rig), a TC Electronics Ditto Looper X2, and an EHX Forty-Five Thousand sampler (used to trigger preset samples during performance. Turner prefers a Heil PR20 vocal microphone. Question: What type of amplifiers did he use? Answer:","response":"Aaron Turner has used various amplifiers throughout his musical career.

He was born at his parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. His paternal grandfather, William C. Wilson, was also an alcoholic. William C. Wilson decided to stop drinking alcohol immediately after having a \\"religious experience\\" when he was under the influence of psilocybin ( sy-l@-SY-bin) during a \\"soul searching\\" hike on Mount Aeolus. In November 1934, Wilson was visited by old drinking companion Ebby Thacher. Wilson was astounded to find that Thacher had been sober for several weeks under the guidance of the evangelical Christian Oxford Group. Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher's visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns hospital under Doctor Silkworth's care and he showed signs of delirium tremens. It was while undergoing treatment with The Belladonna Cure that Wilson experienced his \\"Hot Flash\\" spiritual conversion and quit drinking. Earlier that evening, Thacher had visited and tried to persuade him to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol. According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, he cried out, \\"I'll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!\\" He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the remainder of his life. Wilson described his experience to Dr. Silkworth, who told him, \\"Something has happened to you I don't understand. But you had better hang on to it\\". Wilson joined the Oxford Group and tried to help other alcoholics, but succeeded only in keeping sober himself. During a failed business trip to Akron, Ohio, Wilson was tempted to drink again and decided that to remain sober he needed to help another alcoholic. He called phone numbers in a church directory and eventually secured an introduction to Dr. Bob Smith, an alcoholic Oxford Group member. Wilson explained Doctor Silkworth's theory that alcoholics suffer from a physical allergy and a mental obsession. Wilson shared that the only way he was able to stay sober was through having had a spiritual experience. Smith was familiar with the tenets of the Oxford Group and upon hearing Wilson's experience, \\"began to pursue the spiritual remedy for his malady with a willingness that he had never before been able to muster. After a brief relapse, he sobered, never to drink again up to the moment of his death in 1950\\". Wilson and Smith began working with other alcoholics. After that summer in Akron, Wilson returned to New York where he began having success helping alcoholics in what they called \\"a nameless squad of drunks\\" in an Oxford Group there. In 1938, after about 100 alcoholics in Akron and New York had become sober, the fellowship decided to promote its program of recovery through the publication of a book, for which Wilson was chosen as primary author. The book was given the title Alcoholics Anonymous and included the list of suggested activities for spiritual growth known as the Twelve Steps. The movement itself took on the name of the book. Later Wilson also wrote the Twelve Traditions, a set of spiritual guidelines to ensure the survival of individual AA groups. The AA general service conference of 1955 was a landmark event for Wilson in which he turned over the leadership of the maturing organization to an elected board.

Which one is it? Options: - Sentence A: \\"The woman enjoyed reading her shoe in the library.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The woman enjoyed reading her book in the library.\\" Reason slowly and give your answer.","response":"Let us analyze both sentences step-by-step: Sentence A: \\"The woman enjoyed reading her shoe in the library.\\" In this sentence, the action described is \\"reading her shoe.\\" Reading typically refers to engaging with written or printed text, while shoes are objects worn on feet.

On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","response":"In assessing the meaning overlap between the two sentences, we need to consider their structure, subjects, and actions. 1. \\"Fish are swimming.\\" 2. \\"A fish is swimming.\\" In both sentences, the structure is similar as they follow a subject-verb pattern. The subject of the first sentence is \\"fish,\\" indicating multiple fish, while the second sentence has \\"a fish,\\" pointing to a singular fish. The main action in both sentences, \\"swimming,\\" is the same. The primary difference is the distinction between a single fish and multiple fish. Based on these criteria, I would rate the overlap between the two sentences as a 4 out of 5. While not identical due to the plurality aspect, they convey a very similar meaning, as they share the same action (swimming) for the subject (a fish/fish)."},{"question":"Question: \\"The KGB often shared data with the CIA.\\" Is the above claim true?

Nick assures me that his scene is self-contained and needs no context. A fight scene plays. Nick pauses and asks, “What did you think?” I look confused and Nick says, “Did you miss me? Let's play it again.” I watch the scene again, but still can't make out Nick. Nick rewinds, plays and pauses. “There I am,” he says, gazing fondly at the screen. Except the screen was gray. No actors. No landscape. Nothing, but gray snow. “What do you think,” he asked, his eyes never leaving the empty screen. At that point, I realized Nick was crazy. “That's great!,” I said. “But look at the time. Time sure flies when you're having fun.” Nick was still staring at the screen with a strange little smile. I stood up. Nick stood up, now not smiling. “You're not going anywhere,” Nick said. It's funny how fear works. I've found that in times of danger, adrenaline supersedes fear.

The information given is that an amount of Rs. 420 grew to Rs. 540 in a span of 4 years. The challenge is to determine what this initial amount of Rs. 420 would grow to if the same rate of interest was applied for 6 years instead of 4. The possible answers are presented as 5 choices from 'a' to 'e', given in some unit 's' - presumably a currency. Steps to solve: 1. First, determine the annual interest rate that caused Rs. 420 to become Rs. 540 in 4 years. 2. Then, apply this interest rate to the initial amount of Rs. 420, compound it for 6 years. 3. The resultant will be the sought-after future value after 6 years, which will match one of the options. This can be solved using simple interest formula, but in this simple task, it is not mentioned that we should use simple or compound interest. I will assume that we need to use simple interest. 1. Simple interest formula: I = P * R * T Where: - I is the interest - P is the principal amount (Rs.420) - R is the rate of interest per annum - T is the time in years (4 years) From the formula, we first need to find the rate R: Rs. 540 - Rs. 420 = Rs. 120 is the interest for 4 years. So, R = I / (P * T) = 120 / (420 * 4) = 0.07142857 (which is 7.142857% per annum) 2. Now we know the rate, let's find out how much Rs. 420 will amount to in 6 years. Using the formula: I = P * R * T I = 420 * 0.07142857 * 6 = Rs. 180 So, in 6 years, Rs. 420 will become Rs. 420 + Rs. 180 = Rs. 600 So, the answer is \\"d) s. 600\\"."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: In the year 2030, human-induced climate change has continued to impact various ecosystems around the globe. Numerous studies and research projects are being conducted worldwide to understand the extent and speed of climate change and its impacts on different aspects of life on earth. One of these studies was recently conducted by a leading research university in the United States. The study looked at the population trends of several animal species across different continents over the past five years. Among the various findings, one statistic stood out stunningly - the polar bear population in the Arctic, which has declined by 31% in the past five years alone. This decline was drastically steeper than in any other animal species included in the study, suggesting the severe impact the warming planet is having on polar habitats. The melting ice caps and the thawing permafrost are making it exceedingly difficult for polar bears to find food, and their breeding and cub-rearing cycles are being significantly affected. In addition, the report highlighted the decrease in the numbers of seals, which are a primary food source for polar bears, in areas with rapidly melting sea ice. Essentially, not only is climate change invading the polar bear's habitat; it's also invading their refrigerators. Hypothesis: The hypothesis that can be generated from the context might be \\"The rapid decline in the polar bear population is primarily due to the consequences of human-induced climate change.\\" This hypothesis can be tested by extending the methodology of the study to include other ice-dependent species and comparing their population trends. It can also be examined by comparing areas of the Arctic with different rates of warming and seeing how polar bear populations fare in each. Moreover, studies tracking individual bears and their success in hunting, reproducing, and surviving can be used to understand in more detail the pathways through which climate change is driving this population decline."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

We propose a Multi-Layer Network based on the Bayesian framework of the Factor Graphs in Reduced Normal Form (FGrn) applied to a two-dimensional lattice. The Latent Variable Model (LVM) is the basic building block of a quadtree hierarchy built on top of a bottom layer of random variables that represent pixels of an image, a feature map, or more generally a collection of spatially distributed discrete variables. The multi-layer architecture implements a hierarchical data representation that, via belief propagation, can be used for learning and inference. Typical uses are pattern completion, correction and classification. The FGrn paradigm provides great flexibility and modularity and appears as a promising candidate for building deep networks: the system can be easily extended by introducing new and different (in cardinality and in type) variables. Prior knowledge, or supervised information, can be introduced at different scales. The FGrn paradigm provides a handy way for building all kinds of architectures by interconnecting only three types of units: Single Input Single Output (SISO) blocks, Sources and Replicators. The network is designed like a circuit diagram and the belief messages flow bidirectionally in the whole system. The learning algorithms operate only locally within each block. The framework is demonstrated in this paper in a three-layer structure applied to images extracted from a standard data set.

Have your veterinarian take x-rays of the puppies. Prepare a nesting area. Arrange for homes for the puppies. Buy puppy formula ahead of time. Isolate the mother three weeks before expected delivery.","response":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Caring for Your Pregnant Dog Introduction As a dog owner, it is essential to understand and care for your pregnant dog in order to keep her and her puppies healthy. This involves regular visits to the veterinarian, monitoring the pregnancy, preparing for the birth, and ensuring proper nutrition. Here is our comprehensive guide to help you know what to expect and how to care for your pregnant dog. 1. Visit the Veterinarian One of the first things you should do after confirming your dog's pregnancy is to schedule regular check-ups with your vet. This will help monitor the health of your dog and her developing puppies. Your vet will be able to detect any potential complications or health concerns and recommend appropriate treatment or management strategies. 2. Be cautious about medication and vaccines Certain medications and vaccines can be harmful to pregnant dogs and their puppies. It is crucial to discuss any medications your dog is currently taking or considering with your veterinarian to ensure there are no risks to the pregnancy. You should also avoid administering vaccines to your pregnant dog, as they can lead to complications and may even affect the health of the puppies. 3. Understanding the stages of pregnancy A dog's pregnancy typically lasts around 63 days, divided into three stages. During the first stage, which lasts about three weeks, the embryos attach to the uterus. The second stage, which covers the next three weeks, is when the puppies develop rapidly. In the third and final stage, the puppies start to move, and the mother prepares for birth. Familiarizing yourself with these stages will help you to better recognize and address any issues that may arise during your dog's pregnancy. 4. Proper nutrition for a pregnant dog Feeding your pregnant dog a well-balanced, high-quality diet is essential for the health of your dog and her puppies. You may need to gradually increase her caloric intake to meet the growing demands of the pregnancy. Talk to your veterinarian about the specific dietary requirements for your dog, and ensure she has access to a constant supply of fresh water. 5. X-ray examination Around day 45 of the pregnancy, your veterinarian may recommend an x-ray examination to assess the number of puppies and their development. This can provide valuable information about the size and position of the puppies, which will help you and your vet prepare for the impending birth. 6. Prepare a nesting area As your dog approaches her due date, it's important to provide her with a comfortable, quiet space for giving birth. This nesting area should be in a low-traffic area of your home, with soft bedding and easy access to food and water. Familiarize your dog with the space in the weeks leading up to the birth so she feels safe and comfortable. 7. Arrange homes for the puppies Finding good homes for the puppies should be a priority once they are born. Communicate with family, friends, or local acquaintances who might be interested in providing a loving home to one of the puppies. This will help ensure that each puppy is placed in a responsible and caring environment. 8. Purchase puppy formula in advance In the event that the mother is unable to produce enough milk or becomes unable to care for her puppies, having puppy formula on hand is essential. This will allow you to step in and provide the necessary nutrition for the puppies to grow and thrive. 9. Isolation period before delivery To minimize the risk of infection, your pregnant dog should be isolated from other dogs and animals around three weeks before her expected delivery date. This will provide a safer environment for both the mother and her puppies, reducing stress and potential health issues. Conclusion Caring for your pregnant dog requires dedication, knowledge, and a proactive approach. Be attentive to her needs, stay in regular contact with your veterinarian, and prepare for the needs of the puppies after they are born. By following these recommendations, you can ensure the health and well-being of both your dog and her new litter of puppies."},{"question":"when was the aca released to the public??","response":"The ACA, which stands for the Affordable Care Act, was released to the public on March 23, 2010.

Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the statement. The statement consists of three main components: swimming parties, US, and Christmas. Step 2: Assess the relevance of the components. Swimming parties typically involve people gathering together at a pool or beach to swim and socialize. Christmas is a holiday celebrated in the US, which usually involves gatherings, gift-giving, and festive activities. Step 3: Evaluate connection between components. In the US, Christmas is celebrated during winter, which is significantly colder than other seasons. Outdoor swimming might not be an optimal choice for a Christmas celebration due to lower temperatures. In some parts of the country, like California and Florida, the climate is warm enough for swimming, even in winter. Step 4: Consider traditions and typical activities associated with Christmas celebrations in the US. Popular activities during Christmas time in the US often include holiday gatherings with friends and family, attending religious services, exchanging gifts, and enjoying festive meals. While swimming could be a part of some families' celebrations, it is not universally considered a typical Christmas activity. Step 5: Final evaluation of the statement. Based on the information gathered, it appears that hosting swimming parties is not a common or typical activity to celebrate Christmas in the US. While it may happen in some areas or among specific circles, it is not observed as a standard practice. Therefore, the statement \\"People normally host swimming parties in the US to celebrate Christmas\\" is not true."},{"question":"Egypt The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods.

Which beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing? The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which had shallow water was a surfer's heaven. Hint: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12] Answer:","response":"Surfer beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing compared to Coral beach. The reason behind this is that Surfer beach had shallow water, which can lead to shorter wavelengths and higher wave heights as ocean waves approach the shore. These conditions might cause the waves to break too early or too close to the shore, making it difficult for surfers and windsurfers to have enough space and time to perform their activities. On the other hand, Coral beach with its deeper water would provide better conditions for surfing and windsurfing, as the waves would have more time to develop and break further from the shore, allowing for a more enjoyable experience for water sports enthusiasts."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Remember that the lower potential energy increases the stability of the system. As the two hydrogen atoms move closer and closer together, the potential energy continues to decrease. Eventually, a position is reached where the potential energy is at its lowest possible point. If the hydrogen atoms move any closer together, a third interaction begins to dominate and that is the repulsive force between the two positively-charged nuclei. This repulsive force is very strong as can be seen by the sharp rise in energy at the far left of the diagram. Paragraph: Ken is a scientist who studies atomic systems. He is currently responsible for studying two systems that they are referring to as Omega and Alpha. These two systems are essential to the research that is being done to potentially allow humans to travel to Mars in a reasonable amount of time. Little is known about these systems currently, but scientists have observed that Omega has been steadily gaining more potential energy. Alpha has been rapidly losing potential energy. Ken is hoping to discern why this is happening and try to utilize his findings to further space exploration. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which system is less stable?","response":"Based on the paragraph, the Omega system is less stable because it has been steadily gaining more potential energy. The lower the potential energy, the more stable the system; hence, Alpha system is more stable as it has been rapidly losing potential energy."},{"question":"Use reasoning to lead to the answer of the following question: What area of town is known for having brick row houses? Options: - baltimore maryland - ghetto - city center - garden - england Reasoning process:","response":"To determine the area of town known for having brick row houses, let us analyze each option: 1. Baltimore, Maryland: Baltimore is a city in Maryland, USA, that is well-known for its historic brick row houses, particularly in neighborhoods such as Federal Hill, Fells Point, and Canton. These houses were built in the 18th and 19th centuries and showcase the city's architectural heritage. 2. Ghetto: A \\"ghetto\\" is a term that generally refers to inhabited areas where minority or underprivileged communities live, often due to social, legal, or economic pressure. The term itself does not directly specify an architectural style or mention brick row houses, so it is not the most appropriate answer. 3. City center: City centers usually feature various architectural styles, including brick row houses in some areas. However, since city centers contain a mix of commercial, cultural, and residential buildings, it is not specific enough to identify as the area known for brick row houses. 4. Garden: Garden refers to an outdoor area with plants, flowers, and other landscaping elements. It does not relate to a specific architectural style or area of town with brick row houses. 5. England: England, particularly London and its surrounding areas, is known for its classic Georgian or Victorian brick row houses (also referred to as terraced houses). These homes defined many British urban neighborhoods in the 18th and 19th centuries, and can still be found in many cities across the country. Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that both Baltimore, Maryland and England are areas known for having brick row houses. It is important to understand that brick row houses can also be found in other cities and countries, and the provided options do not cover all possible areas where they might be located."},{"question":"Q: what teams have beat the patriots in super bowls?

He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Context: Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City. He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna (nicknamed \\"Bamie\\"), a younger brother, Elliott, and a younger sister, Corinne. Elliott was later the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; his other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore Sr. was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \\"C.V.S.\\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill. Theodore's fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler family. Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the \\"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for display. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled \\"The Natural History of Insects\\". Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included Confederate leaders. Roosevelt said, \\"My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body. Question: How did his poor health affect his childhood? Answer:","response":"Theodore Roosevelt's childhood was significantly affected by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused a feeling of being smothered to death, which terrified both young Theodore and his parents. Due to the lack of a cure at that time, his health issues shaped his early years. However, his energy and mischievous curiosity remained unaffected, as he developed a lifelong interest in zoology and natural history despite his health challenges. Eventually, Roosevelt discovered the benefits of physical exertion in managing his asthma, leading him to adopt a rigorous exercise regime and strengthen his body."},{"question":"If \\"A little blond girl digging in the sand with a green shovel and bucket.\\" does that mean that \\"A child playing at making a sand castle.\\"?

This force is called a magnetic force. The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them. Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch? These forces are known as non-contact forces. Another type of non-contact force you may be familiar with is gravity. Gravity too can cause changes in motion.

All were treated and released at a hospital in Massena, New York, near the Canadian border, and returned to the ship. Not that there was a big rush: Authorities have drained the lock to better assess the damage, and the ship was still stuck there this morning, along with the passengers, reports CNN. The Saint Laurent has about 275 people aboard as it travels, or tries to travel, from Montreal to Toronto. Expand this summary.","response":"Last night, a cruise ship attempting to navigate a lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway collided with a wall, resulting in minor injuries to approximately two dozen passengers and crew members, as reported by NBC News. Passengers and crew from the cruise ship, The Saint Laurent, were treated at a nearby hospital in Massena, New York, located near the Canadian border. Fortunately, all injured individuals were treated and released, after which they returned to the ship. However, getting back to the ship was not an immediate priority, as the lock had been drained to properly assess the damages caused during the collision. CNN reports that the ship, along with its approximately 275 passengers and crew, remained stuck in the lock this morning. The passengers aboard the Saint Laurent are currently unable to continue their planned journey, which was initially set to take them from Montreal to Toronto. The incident has raised concerns over the safety measures being implemented on cruise ships, particularly regarding navigation in potentially dangerous or unfamiliar waterways. The St. Lawrence Seaway serves as a vital passageway for international shipping vessels, connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. It is crucial to ensure the safety of both the passengers aboard these vessels, as well as the integrity of the infrastructure of the Seaway. Authorities will be investigating the specifics of this incident to determine the root cause of the collision and to identify any potential negligence or error that may have contributed to it. Furthermore, they will be assessing what steps need to be taken to repair the damages to both the ship and the lock in question. Moving forward, it is essential to review and enhance safety protocols when navigating through locks, as well as to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is in place to handle the various types of vessels that traverse the St. Lawrence Seaway. This will not only help to minimize the risk of future incidents like the one involving The Saint Laurent but will also contribute to reassuring passengers and crew members that their safety is always a top priority."},{"question":"If I tell you that Exposed soil is susceptible to damage from rain, and ask you the question \\"what does rain do to exposed soil?\\", is the correct answer \\"it decreases\\"? Answer:","response":"No, the correct answer is not simply \\"it decreases.\\" A more detailed explanation would be that rain can have several effects on exposed soil. These effects include erosion, compaction, nutrient leaching, and the disruption of soil structure. 1. Erosion: When heavy rain falls on exposed soil, the force of the raindrops can dislodge soil particles. The runoff created by the rain transports these soil particles downhill. Over time, this process can lead to extensive soil loss, especially on slopes or in areas where the soil is loose and sandy. 2. Compaction: Rainwater can cause soil compaction, particularly in soils with high clay content. The water fills in the spaces between soil particles, reducing the amount of air and making it more difficult for plant roots to penetrate the soil. Compaction also decreases the rate of water infiltration, which can cause water to sit on the surface, leading to more erosion and poor root growth. 3. Nutrient leaching: As rainwater infiltrates the soil, it dissolves and carries nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, to deeper levels or out of the rooting zone entirely. This leaching process can lead to lower soil fertility and poor plant growth. 4. Disruption of soil structure: Rain can cause soil particles to break apart and disperse, particularly in soils that are not well-aggregated or protected by plant cover. This can lead to the breakdown of the soil structure, making the soil more susceptible to erosion and compaction. In conclusion, rain can have various negative impacts on exposed soil, including erosion, compaction, nutrient leaching, and the disruption of soil structure. To prevent these issues, it's important to implement soil conservation practices such as mulching, planting cover crops, and maintaining vegetation on slopes."},{"question":"In these two sentences (1) Pay attention to.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering methods to combat climate change, it's important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of various energy sources. Traditionally, the world has relied heavily on fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production. As we know, the burning of these fuels releases significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and various environmental issues. On the other hand, renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower offer a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. These energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions during power generation. Additionally, they do not deplete natural resources, ensuring a more stable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the foreseeable future. However, renewable energy sources have their drawbacks as well. For example, the initial investment for renewable energy infrastructure can be high, and the generation of electricity is often contingent on factors like sunlight, wind, and water flow, making them less reliable in certain circumstances. Despite these challenges, the continuous advancements in renewable energy technology have resulted in lower costs and improved efficiency. Energy storage solutions, such as battery systems, are also being developed to address the intermittent nature of renewable energy and secure a stable power supply. Moreover, it is essential to acknowledge the urgency of the current climate situation. As global temperatures rise and climate patterns shift, transitioning to cleaner energy sources becomes increasingly imperative. Rather than remaining heavily dependent on fossil fuels, the world should aim to diversify its energy mix and invest in renewable energy development. Taking into account the environmental benefits, long-term sustainability, and the pressing need to halt climate change, it's clear that the advantages of renewable energy sources far outweigh the drawbacks when it comes to mitigating climate change. Thus, the answer to the question is yes."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Dans cette phrase, je parle français.

Michael, on the other hand, just began adulthood and is still quite young. Both of them want to ask the doctor about their risks for future health problems. Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. A:","response":"Michael is less likely to develop cardiovascular disease compared to Robert. This is because Robert is in the late adulthood phase of his life, where the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer increases due to factors such as a decline in strength, stamina, and immune system function. In contrast, Michael is in the early phase of adulthood and is still quite young, so his risk is comparatively lower."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: bathroom, plenty, provide What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"In the big bathroom, there are plenty of supplies that provide everything we need for taking a bath and brushing our teeth."},{"question":"Translate \\"Mr Schulz, I believe it was important that the European Council, after intense discussions, agreed on the role of the Commission.\\" to Romanian?","response":"\\"Domnule Schulz, cred că a fost important ca Consiliul European, după discuții intense, să cadă de acord asupra rolului Comisiei.\\""},{"question":"Process: - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a dense cake is required happens, how will it affect less flour is used.

Question: What are the number of movable eye coverings do birds have? Context: Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.

Meanwhile, they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears. A serial killer, who is listening to their confessions, makes their nightmares come true, killing each one of them in a sadistic way. \\"American Nightmare\\" is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday, 13th. Then, the story shifts to a bar, where seven friends are celebrating Halloween.

However, the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan, giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting.

In the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, the Republic of Ireland's government made a point of being seen to be neutral. But that is not the case when it comes to this month's vote on a British exit (Brexit) from the EU. While saying it is matter for the British people to decide, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny has made a series of visits to the UK, urging the estimated 400,00 Irish citizens living in Britain to vote to remain in the EU in both countries' interest. \\"Europe will be much stronger with Britain as a fundamental member\\", Mr Kenny said. \\"So it's a vital issue for Europe, it's a vital issue for Britain, but it's also a critical issue for Ireland.\\" Mr Kenny took that message to Ruislip, west London, on the May Bank Holiday weekend, when London was playing his home county Mayo in the All-Ireland Gaelic football championship. Most, though not all, of the emigrant fans present seemed to agree with the taoiseach's assessment. When both states joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, the Republic of Ireland was economically dependent on UK trade; it had no choice other than to join, once Britain decided to do so. But that dependency is no longer the case, even though Britain remains the Republic of Ireland's single biggest European trading partner. Currently, it is estimated that more than 1bn euros (Â£793m) in merchandisable or sellable goods travel between the two islands every week. While some say a Brexit would be good news for Dublin's financial services industry, the independent think-tank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, is of the view that, overall, a Brexit would be bad for the Republic of Ireland. Dr Edgar Morgenroth from the ESRI says that such a development would not be catastrophic, but it would be significant. \\"A Brexit would have negative economic implications for the UK and it would also have some negative implications for Ireland,\\" he said. \\"Our analysis suggests that the trade impact on Ireland could be to reduce exports on the merchandisable side by 3%.\\" Then there is the worry about the return of customs posts and a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if there is a Brexit and fears about the political and economic implications of that. Because of all the uncertainty, the vast majority of political parties and politicians in the Republic of Ireland are hoping that the UK electorate votes to stay in the EU. But not everyone. Thomas Pringle, a Independent member of the Irish parliament, representing Donegal, believes the EU is fundamentally flawed, undemocratic and unaccountable. \\"I hope that the British people vote Yes to Brexit on June 23 because if it speeds the break-up of the European Union, I believe that would be a very welcome development for all the citizens of Europe and will allow us on the west coast of Ireland to exercise our own rights to our own fishing resources,\\" Mr Pringle said. Four months after the Republic of Ireland's general election, many residents believe another vote - the UK's Brexit referendum - may turn out out to be as important, if not more so, for people's livelihoods south of the border than their own poll. What is a summary of this text?","response":"This text is talking about the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Britain, especially about the Brexit vote. The Irish Prime Minister, Enda Kenny, wants the British people to vote to stay in the EU because it would be better for both countries. Some people think that trade could be hurt if Brexit happens, and there might be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But, some other people in Ireland think that Brexit would be good to help break up the European Union. The vote is very important for people living on both sides of the border."},{"question":"You will be given a trivia clue, and the category it belongs to.

Article: An electric signal can trick a monkey's brain into believing the animal's finger has been touched. Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys . The scientists implanted electrodes --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers \\" a nice clear pathway\\" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee or someone with a injury of spinal cord.

Families who are disadvantaged are going to have a much more difficult time obtaining bail.\\" When asked if they would be able to afford a hypothetical emergency expense costing 400, such as bail money for a family member, only 47 percent of Americans said that they would be able to pay without selling something or borrowing money, according to the Federal Reserve's most recent data. \\"If the family doesn't have the bail amount handy at the arraignment, within minutes the defendant could be on a bus to Rikers,\\" Prestia said. \\"Then the process to take them home [after posting bail] could take days.\\" Cash bail amounts, intended to be insurance that someone arrested for a crime will show up for their court date, can become a problem when defendants who are unable to pay must wait in jail for their court date, often resulting in job loss and financial strain. Read MoreObama administration wants to give prisoners Pell grants The almost 18 million supervised release program in New York City will be an expansion of pilot projects in the boroughs of Queens and Manhattan, and will let 3,000 eligible defendants remain at home with their families and continue working while waiting for trial, the mayor's office said. In the Queens pilot, 87 percent of the people being supervised in the project returned to court without using cash bail. At Rikers Island, 40 percent of detainees are there because they can't afford to make bail, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which testified before the New York City Council to advocate abolishing cash bail. The average cost of keeping someone in jail while they wait for trial is approximately 19,000 per defendant, compared with averages ranging from 3,100 to 4,600 for alternatives like community supervision, depending on the person's risk level, according to research sponsored by the Department of Justice. In addition to housing costs to taxpayers, waiting in jail can be costly for defendants. Spending sometimes months in jail before their court dates, defendants can lose their jobs from missing work, said Nancy Fishman, project director at the Vera Institute of Justice, causing a spiral effect for families as missed payments for things like mortgages, cars and child support begin to add up. \\"We're talking about people who don't have jobs where they can just say 'Hey I'm not going to be in for a few weeks, can I still have my job when I get back?'\\" said Fishman. Aside from financial effects, being held in jail—even for a short time—has effects on future behaviors, according to the Vera institute's report Incarceration's Front Door: The Misuse of Jails in America. Compared to defendants who were held for no more than 24 hours, those held for eight to 14 days were 51 percent more likely to go back to jail for another crime after sentence completion. Jails are a gateway into the criminal justice system, Fishman said. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The article discusses the flaws in the cash bail system in the US, particularly how it affects disadvantaged families who struggle to obtain bail for arrested family members. Many Americans wouldn't be able to afford a 400 emergency expense, such as bail money, without selling something or borrowing money.

Situated in the heart of the state, it's enclosed by the Sandia Mountains to the east and the Rio Grande to the west, forming a picturesque natural backdrop that sets it apart from other locations in New Mexico. The 505 area code encompasses largely the metropolitan area of Albuquerque and the northern and western parts of New Mexico, attributed to populous and economically significant regions such as Santa Fe and Farmington. This area code has been in effect since the inception of area codes in 1947, serving as a critical identifier for telecommunications in this terrain of stunning landscapes, unspoiled wilderness, and rich Native American culture. However, due to increasing demand for telephone numbers and the limitation of numeric combinations, the 575 area code was introduced in 2007 to cater to new numbers in the region. This was mainly to serve the southern and eastern regions of New Mexico, including cities like Las Cruces, Roswell, and Carlsbad. Apart from the utilitarian purpose, these two area codes, 505 and 575, over time have become cultural identity markers, symbolizing a sense of community and belonging among the locals. The locals often associate area code 505 as synonymous with Albuquerque, exhibiting a sense of pride. It can be seen reflected in local business names, community initiatives, and even popular culture, showcasing the robust local flavor of Albuquerque. In terms of economy, the area coded 505 (Albuquerque inclusive) is home to vibrant sectors such as the technology, healthcare, and entertainment industries. It houses numerous high-tech research facilities and is the economic hub of New Mexico, supplemented by the art scene, which is thriving due to the city's cultural diversity. On the other hand, the 575 area experiences an economy largely based on agriculture, oil and gas, tourism, with a growing prominence in aerospace and defense sectors—especially with the presence of renowned institutes such as New Mexico State University, White Sands Missile Range, and the Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory. Therefore, area codes 505 and 575, though seemingly just phone code extensions, are substantially more than that. They embody the diverse communities, vibrant economies, cultural identities, and the geographical uniqueness of Albuquerque and New Mexico while serving as a lifeline connecting the populace across distances."},{"question":"Fact 1: Centrioles are organelles involved in cell division.

Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman, who slashes Gittes's nose. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the imposter Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer, but tells Gittes to check the day's obituaries. Gittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of his wife's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at his personal club, Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work, and offers to double Gittes's fee to search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has changed ownership. Investigating the valley, he is attacked by angry landowners, who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply. Gittes deduces that the water department is drying the land so it can be bought at a reduced price, and that Mulwray was murdered when he discovered the plan. He discovers that a former retirement home resident is one of the valley's new landowners, and... Answer:","response":"The person who is attacked by angry landowners in the film Chinatown is J.

The Falcons dominated scoring 21 unanswered points as Michael Turner would run for a 1-yard touchdown for a 7-0 lead. It was then followed up by Matt Ryan finding Julio Jones on a 50-yard touchdown pass taking the game to 14-0 in the first quarter. In the 2nd quarter, Ryan and Jones hooked up again on an 80-yard pass sending the game to 21-0. The Colts finally got on the board as Jerraud Powers returned an interception 6-yards for a touchdown making the halftime lead 21-7. In the 3rd quarter, Ryan hooked up with Tony Gonzalez for a 1-yard pass making the score 28-7. In the 4th quarter, Matt Bryant would kick a 20-yard field goal to send his team for a final score of 31-7. With the loss, the Colts then fell to 0-9 giving them their first losing season since 2001.

Matt Ryan of the Falcons found Julio Jones on a 50-yard touchdown pass and then later connected once more for an 80-yard pass. Meanwhile, in the 3rd quarter, Ryan threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Tony Gonzalez. The difference in length between the longest and the shortest touchdown pass is calculated by subtracting the shortest length from the longest length.

Frank is delighted to discover that his next-door neighbour is Bob Mitchell, a friend from his days in the army. Frank finds employment in a travel agency run by another old army chum. As the children grow up and the country adapts to peacetime, the family attend a number of events, such as the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley in 1924. Reg becomes friendly with Sam, a staunch socialist, who is attracted to Vi. Queenie is pursued by Bob's sailor son Billy, but she longs to escape the suburbs and lead a more glamorous life elsewhere. During the General Strike of 1926, Reg is injured in a brawl in Whitechapel Road. Vi blames Sam, who had brought her brother to the area, but eventually her anger dissipates and she marries him.

Lyric Dogs, if she was not mistaken, was an alternative band known for their unique blend of heavy metal and poetic lyrics. It wasn't surprising that she wouldn't follow them closely, as their music could be quite unusual and not catered to everyone's taste. But the song she heard on the radio, with just the singer and one guitar, intrigued her as it seemed to deviate from the band's regular sound. The idea of an acoustic version of their songs could be a fascinating prospect. Stripping down the music to its core and focusing on the lyrics might offer a new perspective on their artistry and could potentially help her appreciate the band in a different light. The absence of heavy metal accompaniment could reveal previously unnoticed nuances in the melody and vocal delivery, making the listening experience fresh and engaging. If Lyric Dogs had indeed released an acoustic album, she should consider giving it a listen with an open mind. Sometimes, bands and artists explore various creative avenues to experiment with their sound, showcase their versatility, or express their emotions in a different way. This often leads to fresh and captivating renditions of familiar songs that could be enjoyable for both long-time fans and casual listeners. To get a hold of the acoustic album, she could start by doing some online research. She could follow the band on their official social media accounts and check major music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music. These platforms often provide extensive album collections and feature both popular and lesser-known releases from various artists. Moreover, she could try joining some fan forums or online communities dedicated to Lyric Dogs and similar music genres. Fans in these communities are usually very knowledgeable and willing to help others discover new music or find specific releases. Alternatively, she could visit local music stores or check online retailers such as Amazon or eBay for physical copies of the album. If the band had released a limited edition or a special collector's version of the acoustic album, she might be able to find unique designs, exclusive bonus tracks, or other exclusive extras that accompany these premium releases. In conclusion, the acoustic version she heard on the radio might be a part of Lyric Dogs' experiment with a different sound or a special release meant for a niche audience. Whatever the case, it has sparked her interest in the band and their music, and she should definitely explore this newly discovered territory. By seeking out the acoustic album and giving it a thorough listen, she can expand her musical horizons, get to know the artistic side of the band, and maybe even become a fan of Lyric Dogs in the process."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in the English and Hindi language.

My belief that justice will be served has gotten one step closer.” Friday’s announcement was far from a surprise; federal authorities said they were investigating the attack as a hate crime just days after the shooting occurred. And Mr. Purinton is facing state charges of premeditated first-degree murder and two counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder. The Justice Department was under pressure to bring federal charges in the case, as the shooting heightened concern that President Trump’s tough talk on immigration was helping foster a climate of hostility toward foreigners. Reports of hateful episodes and attacks this year have prompted several states to craft anti-hate legislation aimed at beefing up penalties and expanding definitions of what constitutes hate. But the attack also created anxiety that rippled far beyond the United States. In India, news of the shooting instilled a combination of fury, fear and uncertainty in the minds of some who were mulling moves to America for work or schooling. Photo The shooting occurred late on a Wednesday night. Mr. Purinton and Mr. Madasani were sitting on the bar’s patio on when Mr. Purinton asked the men “what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally,” Mr. Madasani said in an interview with The New York Times shortly after the shooting.

But Mr. Purinton soon returned in rage and opened fire on Mr. Kuchibhotla and Mr. Madasani, the authorities said. After the shooting began, Mr. Grillot, the other bar patron, tried to count the shots while he hid under a table, he told The Times. Thinking the gunman had run out of ammunition, Mr. Grillot said, he tried to intervene, but was shot. Soon after the attack, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, called the episode “tragic” but rejected any link between Mr. Trump’s policy agenda and anti-immigrant violence as “absurd.” Several days after the shooting, Mr. Trump denounced the episode and the desecration of two Jewish cemeteries by saying that the country “stands united in condemning hate and evil.” The White House also issued a statement the same day condemning the shooting as “an act of racially motivated hatred.” ||||| Adam Purinton was charged Feb. 23, 2017 with shooting to death an Indian man and wounding a second Indian man and an American in a bar. (Reuters) A federal grand jury on Friday indicted a Kansas man on two hate crime charges in connection with a shooting in February that killed one Indian man and injured another. The attack, in Olathe, Kan., prompted immediate fears that it was motivated by bias after witnesses said the gunman told the two Indian men to “get out of my country” and uttered racial slurs. Police quickly filed first-degree murder charges against Adam W. Purinton, 51, and identified him as the suspected shooter. The FBI then said it was investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime. One of the Indian men shot during the attack — Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32 — died in the hospital, police said. Alok Madasani, 32, was released from the hospital a day later. Both of the men worked for Garmin, the technology firm. A third man, Ian Grillot, was wounded when he tried to intervene. [He yelled ‘Get out of my country,’ witnesses say, and then shot 2 men from India, killing one] In an indictment filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, Purinton is charged with two hate crimes — killing Kuchibhotla and attempting to kill Madasani. The indictment states that Purinton “intentionally and specifically engaged in an act of violence, knowing that the act created a grave risk of death to a person.” An attorney for Purinton declined to comment on the indictment Friday, saying he had not yet read it. Under federal law, Purinton could face the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. The Justice Department said in a statement that a decision about whether to seek the death penalty would be made “at a later date.” Purinton also is charged with one count of causing death through use of a firearm. “The indictment alleges that Purinton committed the offenses after substantial planning and premeditation, attempted to kill more than one person in a single criminal episode, and knowingly created a grave risk of death to others on the scene,” the Justice Department said in its statement. [FBI investigating shooting of two Indian men in Kansas as a hate crime] Witnesses who spoke to the Kansas City Star and The Washington Post said Purinton was thought to have been kicked out of the bar before the shooting occurred. “He seemed kind of distraught,” Garret Bohnen, a regular at the bar who was there that night, said in an interview. Purinton reportedly came back into the bar and hurled racial slurs at the two Indian men, including comments that suggested he thought they were of Middle Eastern descent. Adam Purinton. (David Eulitt/Kansas City Star via AP) The shooting inside Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe, about 20 miles southwest of Kansas City, reverberated around the world, as relatives of the Indian men said they worried the shooting was tied to a burgeoning climate of fear and xenophobia in America. Pointing directly to the election of President Trump, the father of one of the injured men urged parents in India “not to send their children to the United States.” Trump, who had been criticized at the time for not speaking out against the Kansas shooting or a wave of anti-Semitic acts happening around the same time, condemned both during a speech to Congress not long after. Purinton was taken into custody the day after the shooting in Kansas. According to a 911 call, a bartender who encountered Purinton later said he had come into her bar and said “he was on the run from police.” The bartender said that when she asked what happened, the man told her: “He said he shot and killed two Iranian people in Olathe.” Further reading: Hailed a hero after Kansas bar shooting, victim said he did ‘what was naturally right to do’ ‘I appeal to all the parents in India not to send their children’ to the U.S., distraught father says after shooting ||||| FILE PHOTO - Adam Purinton, 51, accused of killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and wounding Alok Madasani, 32, as well as an American who tried to intervene, appears via video conference from jail during his initial court appearance in Olathe, Kansas, U.S. on February 27, 2017. REUTERS/Jill Toyoshiba/Pool/File Photo (Reuters) - A Kansas man, accused of shouting “get out of my country” as he shot dead one Indian man and injured another at a bar, faces federal hate crime and firearms charges, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday. A U.S. grand jury indicted Adam Purinton, 52, on charges of killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounding Alok Madasani, both 32, because of their race, color, religion and national origin. Purinton was also charged with a federal firearms violation in the Feb. 22 incident at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, a Kansas City suburb. The shootings also injured an American, Ian Grillot, 24, who tried to intervene. “The indictment alleges that Purinton committed the offenses after substantial planning and premeditation, attempted to kill more than one person in a single criminal episode, and knowingly created a grave risk of death to others on the scene,” the Justice Department said in a news release. An attorney for Purinton could not immediately be reached for comment. He also faces state murder and attempted murder charges. Local media reported at the time that Purinton thought he had killed two Iranian men. Purinton’s indictment comes amid growing concern about a wave of hateful actions across the United States aimed at blacks, Jews, Muslims and other groups targeted by inflammatory rhetoric that gained prominence during the 2016 presidential election. If convicted, Purinton could face capital punishment or life in prison.

After a string of robberies and sexual assaults on New Year's... (Associated Press) BERLIN (AP) — Police in Cologne say they have received more than twice the usual number of criminal complaints alleging crimes of a sexual nature during the first day of this year's street carnival. A spokeswoman for Cologne police attributes the rise to greater awareness and sensitivity following the public uproar over sexual assaults in the city on New Year's Eve. Twenty-two allegations, ranging from insults of a sexual nature to one case of rape, were filed with police Thursday and overnight. A Belgian TV reporter was groped live on camera by an unidentified person. Last year there were 10 such criminal complaints. Police spokeswoman Dorothee Goebel said Friday that \\"the way people file criminal complaints has changed since New Year's Eve, and that's good.\\" ||||| They came dressed defiantly in mini-skirts and micro-shorts despite the rain and freezing winds, but for thousands of young women taking to the streets of Cologne for the city’s annual carnival season there was no escaping a new sense of trepidation. Antoine Even, a 20-year-old business student, joined the bedraggled legions of dogs and Darth Vaders, crocodiles and cowboys, bumble-bees and bunny rabbits, but just a month after the Cologne sex attacks, she could not completely forget her concerns. \\"We decided that we’re not going to be afraid, we’re going to party - otherwise they just win\\" “We have our pepper sprays,” said Ms Even, patting the bum-bag around her waist. “Our parents didn’t really want us to come and they warned us to be very careful, but we decided that we’re not going to be afraid, we’re going to party - otherwise they just win.” Aided by copious quantities of beer and bratwurst, it would be wrong to say that the carnival spirit had died this year in one of Germany’s most progressive cities, but equally it was true that for many people, despite all the gaiety, something felt different. Photo: Getty Perhaps it was the overwhelming police presence watching over the revellers as they went slip-sliding, arm-in-arm along the cobbled streets around Cologne’s famous cathedral, the most visible reminder of the assaults and robberies against scores of women at the New Year’s Eve celebration. 'People are scared' That, and the threat of terrorism after the Paris attacks – deepened by the arrests of three Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) suspects on the morning of the Carnival opening, including two in a town just 50 miles from Cologne – combined to provide an unavoidably tense backdrop to this year’s event. “A lot of people are afraid, but we are doing everything we can to make them feel safe and confident in the security,” said Wolfgang Baldes, senior spokesman for the Cologne police, confirming that police numbers had doubled from last year to 2,000 officers, many in riot gear. Photo: AP “Cologne is an open-minded city,” he added, “and we are also trying to protect that - we need to make people feel safe again.” Before the event, police distributed flyers on social etiquette at the carnival, explaining the innocent practice of “Butzen” where carnival-goers plant kisses on fellow-revellers cheeks, and explaining \\"women and men must always consent to the 'butzen'. No means no!\\" Photo: Getty After the opening night police reported 190 arrests, including 22 sexual assaults in a crowd that was overwhelmingly white – there were no reports of gangs operating, although a Belgian TV reporter said she was groped on-air by a man of European appearance who grabbed her breast. But after a grim year both for Europe and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, there was inevitably talk of politics at the beer-stalls in a week when the need to deal afresh with the refugee crisis saw the German leader’s personal poll-ratings hit a five-year low. Photo: Getty After Mrs Merkel so publicly threw open the gates last autumn, Germany has accepted more than a million migrants – many undocumented - straining public services and leading to fierce criticism of Germany’s leader for failing to manage the flow better. Despite the sex attacks, many of the revellers in Cologne – one of Germany’s most progressive and multi-cultural cities – still voiced in-principle support for Germany taking refugees, but with important new caveats that point to the urgent need for Mrs Merkel to take control of the problem. “Germany must help these people, but we must do more to integrate them,” said Katrin Burkatzki, a 53-year-old web designer, who said that the Merkel-government’s decision to toughen its asylum policy after its initial open-arms welcome was a necessary shift to stop Germany lurching to the Right. 'Europe has changed' Since the national mood soured on refugees, Mrs Merkel has responded by pressing for new laws to make it easier to deport criminals and economic migrants and harder for refugees to bring their families, as well as limiting the attraction of Germany’s welfare system by offering vouchers, not cash. “Europe has changed this year. This is a dangerous time,” said Mrs Burkatzki, noting the rise of the far-Right Alternative for Germany (AFD) party which now topped 12 per cent in the polls. \\"The politicians have to act to take away their arguments or the AFD will just get bigger.” On the streets, Mrs Merkel attracted her fair share of criticism, but her personal position is shored up by the lack of an obvious challenger in her own party and the sense that her political opponents on the centre-Left are not obviously better-equipped to deal with the challenges. Still, patience can be heard wearing thin, even in liberal Cologne where the people are proud to contrast their open-mindedness with what one carnival-goer called the “bitter Bavarians” who have borne the brunt of the influx and been most critical of Mrs Merkel. Photo: Eddie Mulholland/The Telegraph “There are too many, just too many people coming so we have to set limits,” said Walter Husges, a retired man out with his wife, Vera, who have lived in Cologne all their lives. \\"We have to find better ways of controlling the numbers.” Despite the sex attacks, it was much harder to find a young person prepared to condemn Mrs Merkel’s expansive refugee policy, with many citing Germany’s “historic responsibilities” that they learn about in school, and their own experience growing up in multi-cultural Germany. Peter Alringhaus, a 20-year-old student was out dressed as Kamal Ataturk (his girlfriend is Turkish) with his best friend David Pogorzelski, the son of Polish immigrants who moved to Germany 25 years ago. Both were still idealistically adamant that being German was not a question of DNA, but a mindset. “Germany has a long history of refugees, and when Jews fled this country because of Hitler and war, other countries took them in,” said Mr Alringhaus, “Now Germany must do the same; we have a responsibility even if it is hard.” Germans support Merkel - to an extent Germans also recognise that Mrs Merkel is not entirely to blame for the mess and are angry at the refusal of other European countries – including Britain – to help share the burden, according to 52-year-old Helen Hofmann, a university administrator who joined the parade. “The refugee crisis is not Angela Merkel's fault. She is under pressure, yes, but most Germans are not against refugees and want a constructive solution. But we need our European partners and it is the egotisms of some national governments which make Europe very vulnerable at present,” she said. It is the prevalence of such beliefs that have protected Mrs Merkel thus far – polls show her coalition would still win a majority if elections were held tomorrow – but most analysts agree time is running short. If 2016 brings another million migrants, it is not clear Mrs Merkel could weather the storm. Her difficulty, says Mujtaba Rahman, head of Europe practice at the Eurasia Group, a leading risk consultancy, is that the problem fueling the refugee crisis is external – a war raging in Syria – and unlike the euro crisis, that cannot be fixed by German fiscal firepower. Refugee crisis affects everyone - and everything And unlike the euro crisis, the refugee crisis is not abstract, but being felt in the streets, neighbourhoods and schools all across Germany. A German-backed €3 billion (£2.3 billion) deal with Turkey to slow the flow of migrants shows little sign of being effective, with European leaders now talking openly of the need to seal the Greek border with Macedonia. If Mrs Merkel has failed to get numbers under control when the summer season starts up again in a few months’ time, the German chancellor will find herself caught on the horns of a very nasty dilemma, warns Mr Rahman. Either she must impose a ceiling on migration to Germany, which would spell the end of Schengen or move to bottle the problem up in Greece by backing a plan close the Macedonian border – a move that could itself destabilise Greece and increase the chances of a ‘Grexit’ - a Greek exit from the euro. “Migration is the key piece in the European puzzle that is already cracking around the edges,” said Mr Rahman, “it’s not only the refugee crisis, but also the risk to Schengen, a ‘Grexit’ and perhaps even a ‘Brexit’. “Those risks all coming together is the apocalyptic scenario - but it is no longer a totally unrealistic one either.” ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Police in Cologne have received over twice the usual number of criminal complaints alleging crimes of a sexual nature during the first day of the city's street carnival.

The Spartans won 42 games in the previous four seasons, but this week face a huge test, traveling to Oregon to face the Ducks (Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET, FOX) in what shapes up to be the most compelling non-conference game of the 2014 season. As Dantonio pointed out, his team has won on the road in every stadium in the Big Ten and they have won their last three bowl games, against Georgia, TCU and Stanford. So he knows his players won't be intimidated by the national stage or by the frenzied scene at Autzen Stadium. On Tuesday I sat down with Dantonio to discuss, among other things, his QB Connor Cook's development, Marcus Mariota and carrying the Big Ten's rep on the Spartans’ backs this week. Question: A year ago at this time Connor Cook makes his first road start at Notre Dame and he was a little shaky. How much different, not only is he, but is the offensive identity now going on this first road trip of the year? Dantonio: Well, really, it's probably night and day, we're much more confident in the quarterback situation that is in place. Not only is Connor better because of the experiences that he’s had but Damien Terry is much better, Tyler O’Connor is much better because of another year’s experience. And they’ve had good springs and good summers. So the whole position I think, as a whole is much stronger. But Connor is a very good quarterback, resilient, big guy, great arm, can move. Q: How much were you holding your breath when you saw him take that shot the other night? Dantonio: Yeah, I was a little bit but he got up and sort of hopped off and he was walking. But I was sort of surprised he came back so quickly in that second series. But he’s a tough guy. And I think that speaks to that. He’s a very competitive person and I thought he played very, very well in the entire first half. We just played him the first half. Q: Do you watch the replay of it and kind of wince? Dantonio: Yeah, a little bit. I thought it was a little late and a little low, so. Q: You know how the media works: A lot of us are saying how your brand has been a great defense. Their brand has been fast-pace offense. It's just a fun matchup on that side. How much do you kind of remind everyone here within the program, 'Hey, it's a lot more than just our defense against their offense?' Dantonio: Oh, every day. This is a football team against each other. Special teams are going to have a huge part in this game; our offense against their defense. We’ve got to be able to move the football and obviously control tempo and win possession time, things of that nature, not turning the ball over. So, this is a football game that really I think is a great football matchup and it's going to be very exciting for us. And I want it to be a life experience for our guys really. Q: When Nick Saban was here you guys went over to Autzen (in '98) and played, and they took it to you guys really good. Anything you could take from that experience way back then? Dantonio: Well, it was loud back then but we had some injuries. Amp Campbell went down and had a broken vertebra in his neck. So that was — you know we lost big. And Akili Smith had a big day. That’s what I remember. But that was 1998, a longer period of time. But I guess the thing that I would say right now is we’ve played in some great environments away from home where very few Spartan fans, very loud, a lot of hype, good football teams, and we’ve been able to win. And so this is an opportunity to play on the road, our first road game of the season. So it's a chance for us as a program within our program to gain experience from that. It's a chance for our seniors to lead in the process. And we’re going to have to handle adversity. You know that’s going to happen. And it's just the way that the game is made. So it’ll have all of that in this football game — that’s why it's such a great game. Q: For every week, accountability’s important. Do you speak about it or harp on it any differently this week since you're playing Oregon and things happen even faster with them? Dantonio: Well yeah, I think it's natural that you’re going to see that, 'Hey, if you’re out of your gap, if you’re not doing what you’re supposed to do, they can take advantage of it and it could hurt you in a big way quick.' They’re a very explosive team. Mariota is also a guy who can take a bad play and make a good one. He’s not the guy that’s going to sit back there and dish everything off. He can take it himself. I’ve been very impressed with his leadership because you see it on the film and very impressed with his toughness because you see it on the film. And I think those two attributes makes him even better. I mean he obviously has physical skills. But those two intangibles allow him to really rise above a lot of people. Q: A lot is going to be made about Wisconsin-LSU last week. You guys are carrying, in a lot of people’s eyes, the Big Ten on your back when you go to Autzen. How do you feel about that kind of responsibility? Dantonio: I think that I worry about what I can control to the best of our ability. That’s what we all have to do here. And so I don’t -- there’s pressure. When you play in big games like this, there’s enough pressure you don’t have to put additional pressure on yourself. We understand the aspects of the game relative to our national reputation, I guess. But more importantly, this has been a stepping-stone process for us since coming here in 2007 to be able to get to a game like this with this type of prestige and prominence. And we’ve done that by going to the different places and winning whether it was Nebraska last year or going back to 2010 and winning at Penn State, or whatever we’ve done. Going into environments and winning, creating a process where we’re now being talked about. So we’re going to find out a little bit more about Michigan State and that’s the beauty of all this because I don’t think we’ve ever — it's not an end-all game because, as I said earlier today, we’ve got 10 more other games and we’re destined for failure if we think this is the end-all game either way. But what I’m concerned about or what I’m excited about is our players go in there fresh, go in there anticipating winning and with a lot of energy and making this a life experience. Q: Can [players] get caught up in some peripheral stuff, almost like having an aura about Oregon where they start worrying about (a big play break eventually just coming)? It seems like when Stanford beat them, they kind of did what Stanford did and stayed focused, not worried about, 'Oh my God, some big play is going to happen.' Dantonio: No, we’re going to play. We’ve played a lot of football games here. I think this’ll be our 95th game as a staff here. So along the way we’ve had opportunities to duck opponents. We’ve never ducked and so we’ll do our best in that capacity. But I’m not worried about our players being intimidated, if that’s what you’re asking. You know, it's more about responsibility-driven, tackling in space, playing the ball in the deep part of the field, pressuring the quarterback, things of that nature but our players will be excited to do those things. And on the offensive side of the ball, as we’ve talked about, there’s a whole other aspect of the game coming, so it’ll be an exciting opportunity and I’m looking forward to it. Q: After the way you guys finished last year, you beat a really fast Ohio State team and then you beat a really physical Stanford team. What do you think that did for the guys in here to have that kind of stuff — and not everybody’s on (the 2013) team — but to draw upon when they’re going out to play a top five team? Dantonio: I think we’re a confident football team. I think we believe in our abilities. More importantly, our coaches believe in our players and our players believe in our coaches. And when you have those dynamics working together there’s great chemistry that exists between the coaches and the players and it creates a dynamic that is tough to beat. Q: What are you most curious that you’re going to find out on Saturday? Dantonio: I’m going to find out as the head football coach a little bit more about our players, how they react when they’re hit with adversity and what kind of senior leadership do we have and upper-classman leadership. We have 14 seniors but we have 21 players who are upper-classmen. And I think that’s a lot of leadership in our football team. But at some point in time, you find out about your football team as you go through the season. And I think we’ll find out a little bit more about Michigan State and this year’s team this week. And regardless of what happens we’ll have to regroup, win or lose, take a week off and get ready to play our next game. And at the end of the season is always how we’ve assessed who we are. We’ve never done it at the beginning of the season. We’ve always assessed who we are and what we’ve been able to accomplish at the end of the season. And that’s what we’ll do this year.

Whereas an agonist causes an action, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist and an inverse agonist causes an action opposite to that of the agonist. - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation. - Inflammation (from Latin \\"inflammatio\\") is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants, and is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and to initiate tissue repair. - Pharmacology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of drug action, where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made, natural, or endogenous (from within body) molecule which exerts a biochemical and/or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species). More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals. - X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\". - Cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic tissue, rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible than muscle. - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Anakinra ( brand name Kineret ) is a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis . It is an interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) receptor antagonist . - A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered organ located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each \\"hand\\" and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having \\"hands\\" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having \\"hands\\" though opposable thumbs are lacking. - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission when there are few symptoms. The cause is not entirely clear. It is believed to involve hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors. Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will be as well. Female sex hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections, are also believed to increase the risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. There is no cure for SLE. Treatments may include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. Alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease. Life expectancy is lower among people with SLE. SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death. With modern treatment about 80% of those affected survive more than 15 years. Women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful. Rates of disease vary between countries from 20 to 70 per 100,000. Women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men. While it most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 45 a wide range of ages can be affected. Those of... - Efficacy is the ability to get a job done satisfactorily. The word comes from the same roots as, and for practical purposes is synonymous with, \\"effectiveness\\". It is used in pharmacology and medicine to refer to both the maximum response achievable from a pharmaceutical drug in research settings, and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings. - Lupus erythematosus is a name given to a collection of autoimmune diseases in which the human immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks healthy tissues. Symptoms of these diseases can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. The most common and severe form is systemic lupus erythematosus. - Alpha-blockers or -blockers are pharmacological agents that act as neutral antagonists or inverse agonists of -adrenergic receptors (-adrenoceptors). - A receptor antagonist is a type of receptor ligand or drug that blocks or dampens agonist-mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a receptor. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active orthosteric (= right place) site or to allosteric (= other place) sites on receptors, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonistreceptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonistreceptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of otherwise unrelated drugs defined by their use in rheumatoid arthritis to slow down disease progression. The term is often used in contrast to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (which refers to agents that treat the inflammation but not the underlying cause) and steroids (which blunt the immune response but are insufficient to slow down the progression of the disease). - Calcium channel blockers (CCB), calcium channel antagonists or calcium antagonists are several medications that disrupt the movement of calcium through calcium channels. Calcium channel blockers are used as antihypertensive drugs, i.e., as medications to decrease blood pressure in patients with hypertension. CCBs are particularly effective against large vessel stiffness, one of the common causes of elevated systolic blood pressure in elderly patients. Calcium channel blockers are also frequently used to alter heart rate, to prevent cerebral vasospasm, and to reduce chest pain caused by angina pectoris. N-type, L-type, and T-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are present in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, and CCBs can directly influence the biosynthesis of aldosterone in adrenocortical cells, with consequent impact on the clinical treatment of hypertension with these agents. - A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions. - In the field of pharmacology, an inverse agonist is an agent that binds to the same receptor as an agonist but induces a pharmacological response opposite to that agonist. A neutral antagonist has no activity in the absence of an agonist or inverse agonist but can block the activity of either. - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. - In biochemistry, a binding site is a region on a protein or piece of DNA or RNA to which ligands (specific molecules and/or ions) may form a chemical bond. An equilibrium exists between unbound ligands and bound ligands. - The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the bloodbrain barrier, bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain. - In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as 1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus; and (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as \\"wrist joints\\". This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum. - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients. - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - Psoriatic arthritis (also arthritis psoriatica, arthropathic psoriasis or psoriatic arthropathy) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that will develop in between 6 and 42% of people who have the chronic skin condition psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is classified as a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Approximately 60% of those affected have the tissue type HLA-B27. - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (17721840) was a French surgeon best known for his description of rheumatoid arthritis. Born in Orléans, he studied under Pierre-Joseph Desault and Marie François Xavier Bichat in Paris, and then from 1792 under Jean Louis Petit in Lyon. In 1796 he obtained an internship at the famed Salpêtrière Hospital, where he assisted Philippe Pinel. He was appointed professor of clinical medicine at the Salpêtrière in 1799. After the restoration, he also held the professorship at the Paris polytechnic school. He was removed in 1830 at the insistence of King Louis-Philippe of France.

While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police. The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog. He is accidentally killed trying to escape the authorities.

His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. - Prometheus the Fire-Bringer (Ancient Greek: , \\"Promtheús Pyrphóros\\") was probably the final play in the \\"Prometheia\\" trilogy traditionally ascribed to the 5th century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. - Ancient Greek religion encompasses the collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology originating in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \\"cults\\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - In the Vedas, Indra is the king of Svarga and the Devas . He is the god of lightning, thunder, storms, rains and river flows. Indra is the most referred to deity in the \\"Rigveda\\". He is celebrated for his powers, and the one who kills the great symbolic evil named Vritra who obstructs human prosperity and happiness. Indra destroys Vritra and his \\"deceiving forces\\", and thereby brings rains and the sunshine as the friend of mankind. His importance diminishes in the post-Vedic Indian literature where he is depicted as a powerful hero but one who is getting in trouble with his drunken, hedonistic and adulterous ways, and the god who disturbs Hindu monks as they meditate because he fears self-realized human beings may become more powerful than him. - In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. In etymology, the \\"cognate\\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \\"cognate\\" derives from the Latin noun \\"cognatus\\", which means \\"blood relative\\". - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Prometheus Unbound ( Ancient Greek : , Promtheus Lyomenos ) is a fragmentary play by the Greek poet Aeschylus , concerned with the torments of the Greek mythological figure Prometheus who defies the gods and gives fire to humanity ( theft of fire ) , for which he is subjected to eternal punishment and suffering at the hands of Zeus . It inspired the play of the same title by Percy Bysshe Shelley . It is thought to have followed Prometheus Bound in the Prometheia trilogy attributed to the 5th - century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus . The text of the Unbound survives only in eleven fragments preserved by later authors . Nevertheless , these fragments , combined with prophetic statements made in the first play of the trilogy , allow the reconstruction of a broad outline . A lengthy fragment translated into Latin by the Roman statesman Cicero indicates that the play would have opened with Prometheus visited by a chorus of Titans . Though Zeus had imprisoned them in Tartarus at the conclusion of the Titanomachy , he has at long last granted them clemency . This perhaps foreshadows Zeus 's eventual reconciliation with Prometheus in the trilogy 's third installment . Prometheus complains about his torment just as he had to the chorus of Oceanids in Prometheus Bound . As the dramatis personae of Prometheus Bound erroneously lists Gaea , it has been suggested that she is next to visit Prometheus in this play , in a sympathetic role that echoes Oceanus ' turn in the first play . Finally , the faulty dramatis personae mentioned above and several fragments indicate that Heracles visits the Titan just as Io had in Prometheus Bound . Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been torturing Prometheus by eating his regenerating liver every day . Again mirroring events in the previous play , Prometheus forecasts Heracles ' travels as he concludes his Twelve Labours . The play thus concludes with Prometheus free from the torments of Zeus , but the Titan and Olympian have yet to reconcile . This... - Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a \\"clap\\", \\"crack\\", \\"peal of thunder\\", or \\"boom\\". - Aeschylus (or ; \\"Aiskhulos\\" c. 525/524 c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in theater allowing conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the chorus. - Prometheus ( meaning \\"forethought\\") is a Titan in Greek mythology, best known as the deity in Greek mythology who was the creator of mankind and its greatest benefactor, who stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to mankind. - The Oresteia is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus concerning the murder of Agamemnon by Clytaemnestra, the murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes, the trial of Orestes, the end of the curse on the House of Atreus and pacification of the Erinyes. This trilogy also shows how the Greek gods interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theater trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\" won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BC. Many consider the \\"Oresteia\\" to be Aeschylus' finest work. The principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized litigation. \\"Orestia\\" originally included a satyr play \\"Proteus\\" following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of \\"Proteus\\" has been lost. - The Prometheia is a trilogy of plays about the titan Prometheus. It was attributed in Antiquity to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. Though an Alexandrian catalogue of Aeschylean play titles designates the trilogy \\"Hoi Prometheis\\" (\\"the Prometheuses\\"), in modern scholarship the trilogy has been designated the \\"Prometheia\\" to mirror the title of Aeschylus' only extant trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\". Unlike the \\"Oresteia\\", only one play from this trilogy\\"Prometheus Bound\\"survives. Inasmuch as the authorship of \\"Prometheus Bound\\" continues to be debated, the very existence of a Prometheus trilogy is uncertain. To the extent that modern scholars postulate the existence of such a trilogy by a single author, the consensus holds that it comprised \\"Prometheus Bound\\", \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", and \\"Prometheus the Fire-Bringer\\", in that order. - In Norse mythology, Thor (from Old Norse Þórr) is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind, and also hallowing and fertility. The cognate deity in wider Germanic mythology and paganism was known in Old English as Þunor and in Old High German as Donar (runic þonar ), stemming from a Common Germanic *Þunraz (meaning \\"thunder\\"). - In Germanic mythology, Odin (from Old Norse Óðinn) is a widely revered god. In Norse mythology, from which stems most of the information about the god, Odin is associated with healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, battle, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and is the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, Odin was known in Old English as Wden, in Old Saxon as Wdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wtan, all stemming from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym wanaz. - Prometheus Bound (\\"Promtheus Desmts\\") is an Ancient Greek tragedy. In antiquity, it was attributed to Aeschylus, but now is considered by some scholars to be the work of another hand, and perhaps one as late as c. 430 BC. Despite these doubts of authorship, the play's designation as Aeschylean has remained conventional. The tragedy is based on the myth of Prometheus, a Titan who defies the gods and gives fire to mankind, acts for which he is subjected to perpetual punishment. - In polytheistic systems there is a tendency for one divinity, usually male, to achieve pre-eminence as King of the Gods. This tendency is paralleled with the growth of hierarchical systems of political power, in which a monarch eventually comes to assume ultimate authority for human affairs. Other gods come to serve in a Divine Council or pantheon, usually linked by family ties from union of a single husband or wife, or else from an androgynous divinity who is responsible for the creation.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","response":"People who smoke Djarum cigarettes may have a preference for cloves, as the Djarum brand is known for producing a popular line of clove cigarettes called \\"kreteks.\\" Kretek cigarettes originate from Indonesia and are made from a blend of tobacco, ground cloves, and other flavorings. The Djarum brand, established in 1951, has become synonymous with kretek cigarettes and is sold in various flavors and formats. The inclusion of cloves in Djarum cigarettes imparts a distinct flavor and spicy aroma, which appeals to many smokers. That being said, here's a more detailed breakdown of the reasons why people who smoke Djarum's might like cloves: 1. Unique taste: The combination of cloves and tobacco in Djarum cigarettes creates a uniquely sweet, spicy, and slightly bitter taste, which can be an enjoyable contrast to the taste of regular tobacco cigarettes. Many Djarum smokers appreciate this distinct flavor profile. 2. Aromatic: The cloves in Djarum cigarettes also produce an aromatic smoke, which some users find pleasant and appealing. The scent can be both soothing and invigorating for certain individuals. 3. Cultural and traditional appeal: Kretek cigarettes have a long history in Indonesia and have cultural significance to many people, especially those familiar with Indonesian traditions. Smoking Djarum cigarettes can represent a connection to these roots. 4. Lower nicotine content: Some Djarum smokers opt for kretek cigarettes due to their relatively lower nicotine content compared to traditional tobacco cigarettes. The addition of cloves dilutes the nicotine level to some extent, making them somewhat milder. In conclusion, the characteristics of Djarum cigarettes—such as their unique taste and aroma—can be appealing to clove lovers. However, it's essential to remember that smoking any kind of cigarette, including kreteks, carries health risks and should be approached with caution."},{"question":"Sentence: Alfred Garth Jones was born in England and died in Sidcup, London where Boris Johnson and the Parliament of the United Kingdom are leaders.

Delta, the last remaining U.S. carrier flying DC-9s, officially retired its fleet on January 6th. Throughout the years, these iconic airplanes have been used by various high-profile personalities, such as Hugh Hefner and 2012 Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan, who both owned a DC-9. Even though Delta's final five Series 50 DC-9s will be sold off, one will be preserved in a museum to showcase its significance in aviation history. Step 1: Discuss the birth and early years of DC-9s The DC-9 was introduced in 1965 as a response to the aviation industry's need for a twin-engine, short-to-medium-range jet for smaller airports. The aircraft quickly gained popularity due to its efficiency, reliability, and ability to service previously untapped markets. Step 2: Highlight DC-9s impact on commercial aviation During the 1960s and 1970s, DC-9s opened new possibilities for air travel, allowing airlines to expand their schedules and passengers to experience the convenience of flying more frequently and to previously inaccessible locations. By servicing smaller airports, the DC-9 helped drive economic growth and increased connectivity between cities across the country. Step 3: Discuss notable usage by high-profile personalities DC-9s have had their fair share of celebrity passengers, most notably Hugh Hefner, who owned a DC-9 for several years, and Paul Ryan, who campaigned in one during the 2012 Vice Presidential race. These instances underscore the aircraft's reliability and comfort for even the most discerning clientele. Step 4: Touch on the retirement and legacy of DC-9s As the last remaining U.S. carrier flying DC-9s, Delta officially retired its fleet on January 6th. Although these aircraft may no longer grace the skies, their impact on commercial aviation is undeniable. One of the final five Series 50 DC-9s will be preserved in a museum, serving as a testament to the crucial role they played in advancing air travel. Conclusion: The DC-9s may have retired, but their legacy lives on. By opening jet routes to small airports and spurring travel across the nation, these iconic aircraft forever changed the landscape of commercial aviation. As we bid farewell to these beloved workhorses, the industry and travelers alike are grateful for the enduring impact they have had on the history of air travel."},{"question":"Answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

He is the guitarist and vocalist of the band Hot Water Music. Ragan has also released a variety of solo material, including a series of 7-inches on No Idea Records, a live album and three studio albums on Side One Dummy Records. - Rumbleseat was the acoustic-folk side project of Hot Water Music frontmen Chuck Ragan and Chris Wollard, and Samantha Jones. Formed in 1998, Rumbleseat released four 7\\" records before releasing the full length album, 'Rumbleseat Is Dead', which was released in 2005. - The New What Next is the sixth full - length studio album by Hot Water Music . It was released by Epitaph in 2004 . This was Hot Water Music 's final release before disbanding in 2006 . - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Hot Water Music is a punk rock band from Gainesville, Florida. The members of the band are Chuck Ragan, Chris Wollard, Jason Black, and George Rebelo. HWM first formed in 1993. In 1998, after releasing multiple EPs and three full-length albums, the band briefly disbanded, but soon reformed, announcing their continuation as Hot Water Music at the concert recorded for \\"Live at the Hardback\\". They are represented by David \\"Beno\\" Benveniste's Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group. In late 2005, Hot Water Music stated they were going on a hiatus following Chuck Ragan's departure. On May 13, 2006 however, the hiatus became seemingly permanent and Hot Water Music officially disbanded. The three remaining members then started a new project, The Draft, whose first album, \\"In a Million Pieces\\", was released on September 12, 2006. Chuck Ragan also continued with a more low-key music career, releasing material through No Idea Records and Side One Dummy Records. He is currently signed to the latter. The band members have also participated in many side projects. The four most popular of these are Blacktop Cadence, Cro(w)s, Unitas and Rumbleseat. - Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group is an artist development and management company and record label located in West Hollywood, California in the United States. Its current client roster includes AFI, Alice in Chains, Blaqk Audio, Code Orange, Crosses, Deftones, Night Riots, Scars on Broadway, System Of A Down, XTRMST. - Live at the Hardback is a live recording of what was thought to be Hot Water Music's final show performed in 1999 and one of the last shows performed at The Hardback Cafe, in Florida. HWM announced at the show that they had decided not to break up. The album was released in 1999 by No Idea Records. 'Live At The Hardback' contains songs from the 'Moonpies For Misfits' EP, which was recorded shortly after the release of 'Live At The Hardback'. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page.

People like Ward Connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate. According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college, graduate school, etc. An argument against affirmative action is that it encourages what?","response":"An argument against affirmative action is that it encourages mediocrity and incompetence.

Questions: Placing a potato where can cause an explosion? Options: - pantry - exhaust pipe - vegetable soup - pot - shopping bags The answer to this question is:","response":"Placing a potato in the exhaust pipe can cause an explosion. The reason behind this is that the exhaust pipe is part of the vehicle's exhaust system, which is responsible for expelling the combustion byproducts (such as gases and fumes) produced by the vehicle's engine. If a potato is placed in the exhaust pipe, it can obstruct the flow of these gases, leading to a buildup of pressure within the exhaust system. This pressure buildup can cause the gases and fumes to accumulate, resulting in a rise in temperature and possibly even a small-scale explosion or damage to the vehicle's engine or exhaust system components. Moreover, the blockage created by the potato may lead to poor engine performance or prevent the engine from starting altogether. On the other hand, placing a potato in any of the other options, (pantry, vegetable soup, pot, or shopping bags) would not cause an explosion.

Doctor gave some medicine to Betty but gave none to Tanya as","response":"Doctor gave some medicine to Betty but gave none to Tanya as there were a few factors at play that led to the doctor's decision in this particular scenario. Firstly, it is important to consider the medical conditions of both individuals. Betty may have had a condition that required immediate attention or medication, such as a bacterial infection, chronic pain, or a mental health issue. In such cases, it is not uncommon for doctors to issue a prescription or over-the-counter medication to help alleviate symptoms and improve the patient's overall health. On the other hand, Tanya might not have a condition that warranted medical intervention at the time of the consultation. For instance, her symptoms could be due to a mild viral infection, which typically resolves on its own without medication. Alternatively, Tanya could be suffering from a non-medical issue, such as mild stress or anxiety, which the doctor may have recommended treating through lifestyle changes or counseling rather than pharmacological intervention. Secondly, the doctor's decision might be influenced by the potential risks and benefits of prescribing medication for both Betty and Tanya. Prioritizing patient safety is a critical aspect of medical practice, and sometimes, avoiding medications is the safer option. Tanya's medical history may include drug allergies, a predisposition to severe side effects, or contraindications with other medications she is currently taking. In these cases, the doctor would be more cautious and consider other treatment alternatives. Another factor could be related to the doctor's perception of the severity and urgency of each patient's condition. They might have concluded that Betty's condition required immediate medical treatment to prevent further complications, minimize discomfort, or shorten the duration of the illness. In contrast, they could have decided that Tanya's symptoms would likely resolve on their own, or could be managed more effectively with non-pharmacological interventions, such as rest, adequate hydration, or hot and cold compresses. Lastly, individualized patient care is another relevant consideration. Each patient is unique in their medical background, personal preferences, and individual circumstances. The doctor might have felt that prescribing medication in Betty's case aligns more closely with her specific needs and preferences, while Tanya could have expressed concerns about taking medications or had the desire to explore alternative treatment methods. In conclusion, several factors might have led the doctor to prescribe medication to Betty but none to Tanya. These factors can include the severity of their respective medical conditions, the associated risks and benefits of prescribing medication, the urgency of treatment, and their individual needs and preferences. The doctor's decision aims to provide the most appropriate care for each patient while ensuring their safety and well-being."},{"question":"Eileen Colgan Simpson (20 January 1934 – 10 March 2014) was an Irish theatre, television and film actress.

In January, passengers of US Airways Flight 1549 had to be rescued out of the Hudson River after a bird strike. Smithsonian Institution scientists say it was migratory Canada geese -- and not resident Canada geese -- that caused US Airways Flight 1549 to ditch in New York's Hudson River on January 15. More specifically, it was at least two female and one male geese flying at approximately 2,900 feet that got sucked into the two engines of the Airbus A320, disabling both engines and causing one of the more spectacular water landings in aviation history. All 155 people safely evacuated the jet. Officials knew almost from the start that Canada geese were responsible for the incident, both because of Capt. Chesley \\"Sully\\" Sullenberger's radio report and because few other types of birds flock at that altitude in the mid-Atlantic. But on Monday, the eve of a three-day National Transportation Safety Board hearing into the crash, the Smithsonian announced that sophisticated scientific techniques allowed them to conclude that the Flight 1549 birds were Canada geese from Labrador, Canada, and were significantly different from geese in New York City. Museum scientists said molecular study of feathers found in the engines leads them to believe the birds had probably nested in Labrador in the summer of 2008 and migrated to the New York region for the winter. On the day of the crash, Smithsonian wildlife biologist Peter Marra said, the ground was covered with snow, and the flock was probably on a short flight south looking for clear ground or water on which to forage for food. Canada geese (Branta canadensis) are \\"essentially flying cows,\\" Marra said, given their unrelenting quest for food. The migratory birds are among the largest species of bird in North America, with an estimated weight of about 8 pounds each. The determination that the birds were the 8-pound variety and not the 4-pound Brant geese is likely to comfort jet engine designers, since the engines are designed to survive strikes from 4-pound birds. But the finding also is likely to raise questions about whether engine requirements should be more robust to survive strikes from 8-pound birds. Bird strikes remain one of the most intractable problems facing aviation. There were more than 7,400 bird strikes in the United States in 2007, including 110 that caused substantial damage to aircraft. But the Federal Aviation Administration estimates that only 20 percent of strikes are reported. Airports attempt to manage local populations of birds by harassing them, typically by creating loud noises that scare the birds away, or by killing birds. But migratory birds require other approaches, such as monitoring their movements and improved radar. Smithsonian scientists say it is important to study bird migration patterns to prevent future collisions. Carla Dove of the Smithsonian's Feather Identification Lab says the Smithsonian has been conducting bird strike identifications for the FAA and the military for more than 50 years. Shortly after the US Airways Flight 1549 incident, the museum got its first feather from a U.S. Department of Agriculture biologist working with the NTSB. In all, the museum got several batches of remains, some from an engine that remained under water three days, and the rest from an engine on the Hudson River bottom for nine days. At the Smithsonian's Conservation Institute labs in Suitland, Maryland, scientists examined isotopes in the feathers. The stable-hydrogen isotope values in feathers can serve as geographic markers since they reflect the types of vegetation in the bird's diet at the time it grew new feathers, Marra said. The feather samples were compared to a reference library of 620,000 specimen at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois, the Smithsonian said. The finding, published today in \\"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment,\\" concluded the geese were from the Labrador area. \\"Although these geese were [migratory], we do not believe that these individuals were actually migrating north to return to breeding areas. Instead, we hypothesize that these birds were undertaking a short-distance movement on their wintering grounds in response to freezing temperatures and snow cover, in an effort to find open water and food, a behavior commonly found in species of birds wintering at temperate latitudes,\\" the report says. At the time of the US Airways bird strike, the flock was in the upper limits of their flying abilities, the Smithsonian said. About \\"3,000 feet is pretty much their limit,\\" Dove said. The highest known bird strike came when a jet in Africa hit a vulture at 37,000 feet, she said. Marra and Dove said \\"billions\\" of birds threaten aviation. Consequently, more research needs to be done on radar capable of detecting birds, more information is needed on migratory patterns and scientists need to integrate weather patterns into models that can predict bird movements, they said. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"In January, a plane called US Airways Flight 1549 had to land in the Hudson River because some birds got into the plane's engines and stopped them from working. Scientists found out that big birds called migratory Canada geese were the ones responsible for the problem. There were 155 people on the plane, but they all got out safely. This event made people think about how to protect planes from bird strikes like this in the future.

James needed another curtain that can completely cover the window. The Pick from: (I) curtain is wide. (II) window is wide.","response":"(II) window is wide. James needed another curtain that can completely cover the window. The window was wide, and regular-sized curtains at the store wouldn't quite do the job correctly. It was crucial that he covered the entire window because he needed to prevent the sun from infiltrating his bedroom every morning. The persistent sunlight made it difficult for him to sleep in on weekends, as the bright rays pierced through the thin, old curtains he used to have. After months of early morning disturbances, he finally decided it was time to invest in proper curtains. James began researching the different types of curtains and materials that could provide the best protection from sunlight. His discoveries led him to blackout curtains, which were specially designed with a thick, tightly woven fabric that could block out light. The unique feature of these curtains was not only their ability to extensively darken a room but also their insulating properties, making them equally effective in conserving energy and reducing noise. After concluding his research, James was eager to purchase a high-quality blackout curtain for his wide window. However, the dimensions of his window were larger than the average ones, and most curtain retailers only stocked standard sizes. Undeterred, James decided to take matters into his own hands and custom-made his perfect curtains. He visited the local fabric store and carefully chose a thick and opaque material for his blackout curtains. He paid particular attention to the weight and texture of the fabric to ensure it was suitable for the purpose. After consulting with the store's staff, he was confident that the material he selected would effectively block out the sunlight while maintaining a visually appealing appearance. Returning home, full of determination, James measured his window again to ensure accuracy in the size of his curtains. Realizing that sewing the curtains himself would prove challenging, James enlisted the help of his friend, Sarah, who was an experienced seamstress. Together, they cut and sewed the fabric to create the perfect set of blackout curtains tailored to the dimensions of James' window. Once completed, James installed the curtains, ensuring that the curtain rod was sturdy enough to support the extra weight. With the help of Sarah, they carefully hung the curtains, ensuring the hooks were evenly spaced and secured to the rod. As the last hook clicked into place, James and Sarah stepped back to admire their handiwork. The curtains hung perfectly, covering the wide window without a trace of sunlight peeping through. James couldn't help but smile, knowing he could finally enjoy his weekend mornings in the darkness and silence he had longed for. The next morning, James woke up, or rather, he didn't. The blackout curtain had done its job, allowing him to fully appreciate that extra hour of sleep. His room was enveloped in darkness, providing the perfect environment for relaxation and uninterrupted sleep. He felt well-rested, more energetic, and prepared to take on the day. James knew that he had made the right decision in custom-making curtains for his wide window. The investment of time and effort had paid off immensely, helping him transform his sleep routine for the better. And as he stood by the window, appreciating the stillness and darkness, he couldn't help but think of other ways to further improve his home, using his newfound crafting skills."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did the mother cuddle with her son?

He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community., what would be the answer ?

This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration.

It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. Question: \\"What action do the blood vessels take to increase blood flow?\\" Response: \\"Contracting\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy.

The Norwegian Bratvaag expedition, studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found the remains of the Andrée expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \\"inaccessible island\\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \\"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had.

A spark is a form of electricity, so it can pass through a soda can. Wrong answers: [-] a wool sweater: Wool is not a metal, and it doesn't conduct electricity well. So, a spark is not likely to pass through it easily. [-] a t-shirt: A t-shirt is usually made of cotton or other fabrics, not metal. So, it also doesn't conduct electricity well, and a spark won't pass through it easily. [-] a rubber eraser: Rubber is an insulator, meaning it doesn't allow electricity to pass through it.

Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions., what would be the answer ?

Following a strategic evaluation of the team's current roster and potential for future growth, the Celtics management has come to this decision with the best interests of the team in mind. Tremont Washington, a talented young player known for his impressive athleticism and versatility, was first drafted by the Boston Celtics back in 2017. Since then, he has had the opportunity to develop his skills under the mentorship of the team's coaching staff, primarily playing in the G-League. During his time with the Maine Red Claws, Washington demonstrated a strong work ethic and impeccable dedication to improving his performance on the court. In spite of his commitment and potential, the Celtics' management has opted to pursue their waiver request for Washington. This decision was based on a comprehensive analysis of the team's current lineup, taking into account the specific skills, experience, and roles of each player. The Celtics' primary focus is to maintain a competitive and well-rounded roster that can effectively challenge their rivals within the fiercely contested Eastern Conference. The decision to seek waivers for Washington does not imply that he is an undesirable player or that he lacks the potential to make a significant impact in the future. In fact, many sports analysts have noted that Washington's impressive skill set is bound to attract attention from other NBA franchises seeking young talent. As a result, this decision serves as an opportunity for the young forward to explore new challenges and find a team that best matches his aspirations. For the Celtics, seeking waivers for Washington will potentially free up a roster spot, allowing them to explore a variety of options to strengthen their line-up. This could include signing a free agent, trading for a new player, or giving increased playing time to other talented prospects within the organization. In any case, improvement in terms of depth and flexibility will be crucial in helping the Celtics to continue their pursuit of championship success. Moreover, requesting waivers for Washington exemplifies the Celtics' commitment to being flexible and adaptive in their approach to team management. The team's management constantly evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of their roster in order to identify potential areas for improvement. Making difficult decisions like seeking waivers for players is a part of this process and demonstrates the Celtics' dedication to maintaining a high-performance culture. In conclusion, the Boston Celtics' decision to seek waivers for Tremont Washington stems from a thorough evaluation of the team's current roster and a vision for future success. Although the move may be disappointing for fans of Washington, it should be viewed as an opportunity for the talented forward to find a team that can fully utilize his skill set. Meanwhile, the Celtics will continue to focus on making well-informed decisions to strengthen and diversify their roster in their pursuit of NBA championship glory."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

To solve for f, we will isolate it by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. 0 - 20561 = (-709) * f Step 4: Simplify the equation. Now we will simplify the left side of the equation. -20561 = (-709) * f Step 5: Solve for f. To solve for f, we will divide both sides of the equation by -709. f = -20561 / (-709) Step 6: Calculate the result.

The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year. Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month. The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women. Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \\"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper. The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000. He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \\"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\\" he said. \\"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction.

Oprah. … Sean? Sean Spicer, arguably the world’s most famous White House press secretary, is developing a talk show with the tentative title of “Sean Spicer’s Common Ground,” in which the former spokesman for President Trump interviews notable people in an informal setting. A pitch sheet for the show’s pilot, obtained by The New York Times, describes Mr. Spicer hosting “some of the most interesting and thoughtful public figures for a drink and some lite conversation at a local pub or cafe.” “The relaxed atmosphere is an ideal setting for Sean to get to know his guests as they discuss everything from the media to marriage,” the pitch continues. “They might even tangle over the merits of making your bed or the value of a great point guard.” No network is attached to the project, but the pilot episode, to be filmed in July, is backed by heavy hitters in the realm of unscripted television. Debmar-Mercury, the syndicator of daytime series including “The Wendy Williams Show” and “Family Feud,” is co-producing with Pilgrim Media Group, which has developed basic-cable staples like “American Chopper.” ||||| Sean Spicer may be entering the TV business. President Donald Trump's former spokesman is teaming with Lionsgate-owned Debmar-Mercury (The Wendy Williams Show) and Pilgrim Media Group (American Chopper) to develop a talk show called Sean Spicer's Common Ground, sources confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. The potential series — a network is not yet attached — would see Spicer interviewing notable people in an informal setting, according to The New York Times, which first reported the news. The Times, which acquired a pitch sheet for a potential pilot for the series, reported that the show would feature Spicer hosting public figures for a drink and light conversation at a local pub or cafe. The pilot is poised to be filmed in July and would feature one guest per week. Attorney Michael Avenatti, who has repped Stormy Daniels, has been approached as a guest for Spicer's pilot. (He declined.) \\"In this current environment, I think it’s important to have a platform where we can have civil, respectful and informative discussions on the issues of the day,” Spicer told the Times. The talk show is one of multiple projects Spicer is pursuing since leaving the White House last July. Repped by WME, Spicer has also launched a podcast, Everything's Going to Be All Right, with conservative writer Katie Pavlich, and joined America First Action, a super PAC created to support Trump and his allies. He also penned a book covering his six months in the White House that is due out July 24.

That will leave Fed-obsessed investors staring anxiously into their computer screens for any future updates, an unhappy situation because the only predictable thing about the Fed lately is that it's unpredictable. The market has been notably reluctant to accept the Fed’s efforts to lift rates but clearly the Fed can’t be accommodating forever. Eventually cheap money will cause inflation to spike (and heaven help us if it doesn’t). On the other hand, higher interest rates are likely to take a bite out of asset prices, which does no favors for the real economy. Some observers have encouraged the Fed to rip off the band aid. Bill Gross told my Bloomberg News colleagues recently that he wants an aggressive series of hikes: “C’mon let’s raise interest rates by 25 basis points in September and, c’mon, six to nine months from now let’s do it again.” Bloomberg View’s Editorial Board argued this week that low interest rates have “artificially boosted financial-asset prices and distorted normal patterns of risk-taking in financial markets.” So how did the market’s fortunes come to be so dependent on the Fed? There's a three-word answer: equity risk premium. The “equity risk premium” is a simple concept that goes like this: I can leave my money in my bank account or I can invest it in the stock market. My money is safe at the bank, but all bets are off in the stock market. Ergo, because stocks are riskier, I will only put my money in the market if I can expect stocks to pay more than what my bank is offering (in technical jargon, a \\"risk premium\\"). Fortunately the equity risk premium is easy to calculate. You take the earnings yield on stocks -- which is an often-used approximation for expected stock returns -- and subtract the yield on cash. For earnings yield, I use the inverse of the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE), and the federal funds rate is a good proxy for the cash yield. According to the CAPE calculated by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, the earnings yield is currently 3.8 percent. The federal funds rate is currently 0.4 percent. That leaves an equity risk premium of 3.4 percent. Not too shabby in this starved-for-return environment, right? Not so fast. The equity risk premium is more worrisome when you look closer. For one thing, the actual risk premium – the difference between what the S&P 500 Index and one-month treasuries have historically returned to investors – has been 6.5 percent annually since 1926 (the longest period for which data is available). By comparison, today’s equity risk premium of 3.4 percent doesn’t seem so great. The equity risk premium has steadily declined since the Fed dropped the federal funds rate to the floor. Sources: Federal Reserve, Homepage of Robert Shiller Methodology: The equity risk premium is the inverse of cyclically-adjusted P/E ratio minus the federal funds rate. When the Fed eventually raises rates, investors will either have to accept an ever-smaller equity risk premium or stock prices will have to decline. Neither one is particularly appealing, but there it is. And it's not just stocks. Investors face the same conundrum with other assets. For example, the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index -- an index of real estate investment trusts -- currently yields 3.7 percent, which translates into a risk premium of 3.3 percent. But the REITs Index has historically delivered a risk premium over one-month treasuries of 7.3 percent annually to investors from January 1972 to August 2016. Risk assets such as stocks and REITs have enjoyed a good run in the era of loose money. As with stocks, the market is currently pricing a risk premium on REITs that is half the risk premium investors actually received for investing in REITs historically. Here too, either the current risk premium will shrink further when the Fed raises rates or REIT prices will take a tumble. It will be one or the other. Investors have leaned on loose money for years to justify paying ever-higher prices for stocks and real estate and a host of other assets. That can’t be easily undone. But it’s time for both investors and the Fed to be honest with themselves: The next chapter in this historic monetary policy experiment won’t be pretty for most asset classes.

Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, family planning consultations, and prenatal information. A maternity hospital was founded in 1991 which is decorated with a fresco by Malang Badji, one of the most famous artists in the region.The Ph.D. thesis published in 2003, La part de l'autre: une aventure humaine en terre Diola, meaning \\"Part of the Other: A Human Adventure in Jola Territory,\\" describes the health challenge present on the island in a more general context.

The second statement, \\"Three guys and their guitars jamming out,\\" can be understood as a description or rephrasing of the same general situation. Both statements convey the idea that three male members of a band are performing or rehearsing their respective guitar parts together. There are several aspects to consider when comparing and analyzing these two statements: 1. The number of participants: Both assertions mention \\"3 men\\" or \\"three guys,\\" establishing that there are three individuals involved in performing or rehearsing. 2. The instruments being played: Both statements specify that electric guitars are the instruments being played. While the first statement explicitly mentions \\"playing electric guitar,\\" the second statement implies this idea through the phrase \\"their guitars.\\" It would be reasonable to assume that these guitars are electric since the first statement highlights this aspect. 3. The situation: The first statement describes the situation as \\"3 men in a band,\\" which suggests that these individuals are not just friends or random musicians playing together; they are part of an organized musical group. The second statement uses the term \\"jamming out,\\" which connotes an informal and spontaneous setting, such as a practice, improvisation, or a casual performance. While the term \\"jamming out\\" does not explicitly state the formal organization of the musicians, it is consistent with the concept of a band since bands often \\"jam out\\" during their practice sessions or while improvising new material. 4. The gender of the individuals: Both statements exclusively mention men or guys. Although gender should not be an essential factor in determining musical abilities or performance, the two statements align in emphasizing male musicians in this particular scenario. Considering all these aspects, we can conclude that the statement \\"Three men in a band playing electric guitar\\" logically follows and aligns with the statement \\"Three guys and their guitars jamming out.\\" The second statement can be viewed as a more informal or colloquial description of the musical scene implied by the first statement."},{"question":"See question below: Of the below sentences, which one does *not* make sense?

Context: I love going to the spa. Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated.

Tampa Bay lost their eighth consecutive meeting at Monster Park, dating to 1980. This game was originally scheduled for 8:15&#160;p.m. on NBC's Sunday Night Football, but on December 10, in accordance with flex-scheduling, the game was moved to the afternoon. Having already clinched a playoff berth, Tampa Bay rested most of their starters in the second half. Despite a late rally, the Buccaneers fell two points short of victory. Tampa Bay controlled most of the first half, capping off their first two drives of the first quarter with field goals by Matt Bryant. On the first play of the second quarter, Shaun Hill connected with Darrell Jackson on a 21-yard touchdown. San Francisco punted on their next drive, and Micheal Spurlock fielded the ball at the 19-yard line. He was tackled and fumbled, while the 49ers recovered. After an instant replay challenge, it was determined that Spurlock was down by contact, and Tampa Bay maintained possession. The drive fizzled though, and ended with a punt. Late in the fourth quarter, Barrett Ruud recovered a 49ers fumble, setting the Buccaneers up on the San Francisco 36-yard line. Four plays later, Jerramy Stevens caught a touchdown pass from Jeff Garcia. Tampa Bay took a 13-7 lead into halftime. On the second-half kickoff, San Francisco recovered a surprise onside kick. The drive came up empty, as they were forced to punt. On Tampa Bay's next possession, however, Luke McCown (who had taken over for the benched Garcia) fumbled and the 49ers recovered at the 14-yard line. In four plays, San Francisco scored a touchdown. Early in the fourth quarter, Nate Clements intercepted a McCown pass, and led to another 49ers touchdown. The 49ers led 21-13, but Tampa Bay still kept hopes alive for a rally. With less than six minutes left in the game, the Buccaneers drove to the 49ers 25-yard line. On 4th down and 6, McCown threw to Michael Clayton for an apparent one-handed touchdown catch, but the ball fell incomplete, and the drive turned over on downs. Tampa Bay managed one final chance to tie the score. Inside the two-minute warning, Tampa Bay drove to the 49ers 24-yard line. McCown rolled out wide to his right, and connected with Stevens for a 24-yard touchdown. McCown then attempted a game-tying two-point conversion.

Earlier on Saturday, he was involved in a shooting and then a carjacking. His father told French radio that his son had phoned after the first attack to say he had \\"screwed up with a gendarme\\", before proceeding to Orly. Belgacem is described as having been radicalised in prison, and was on a police watch-list. His criminal record included convictions for armed robbery and drugs offences, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters late on Saturday. Intelligence agents searched his home in Garges-les-Gonesse, north of Paris, for evidence of Islamist sympathies, but reportedly found nothing. However, traces of cocaine were discovered during the search. Early on Saturday morning, Belgacem was stopped at a checkpoint in Garges-les-Gonesse, north of Paris. He fired at police with a pellet gun before escaping in a car that was later found abandoned. Police say he then stole a car at gunpoint from a woman at Vitry, south of Paris. That car was later found at Orly airport. Belgacem arrived at the airport and attacked a military patrol in the south terminal. He tried to seize a servicewoman's automatic weapon, put his gun to her head and said: \\"I'm here to die for Allah. In any case people are going to die.\\" He was then shot dead by two other soldiers. A copy of the Koran was found on his body, Mr Molins added. His father, brother and cousin were taken in for questioning in the aftermath of the attack. All of them have since been released without charge. Speaking to Europe 1 radio on Sunday, the father said his son was not a terrorist, but someone who \\"never prayed and he drank\\". \\"This is what happens under the influence of drink and cannabis,\\" the father said. He said he had received a phone call from Belgacem after his initial attack in which he said: \\"Dad, please forgive me. I've screwed up with a police officer.\\" Then he hung up saying he was on the motorway. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the picture is building up of a man on the criminal fringes of society, who also consorted with Islamist radicals. Orly - located 13km (8 miles) south of Paris - is the capital's second-largest airport. The attack came at a sensitive time. France has presidential elections starting next month and remains under a state of emergency. The soldiers at Orly were part of Operation Sentinel - involving thousands of soldiers deployed to provide back-up to the police after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015 and the Paris attacks of November 2015.

While age spots typically remain constant over time, cancerous spots will darken and change in shape, such as growing or becoming more uneven. You can recognize potentially cancerous spots using your ABCDEs: Asymmetric shape Borders (edges) that are uneven Colors that vary, such as different shades of brown, black and tan Diameter that's large (>¼ inch or > 6mm) or changing Evolving, such as changing in size, shape, and color It’s always better to be safe when it comes to your health. Your dermatologist can check your age spots to make sure there are no causes for concern. Additionally, they’ll help you learn what’s normal and what’s not. If you don’t have a dermatologist, ask your primary care physician for a referral or search for one online. Your doctor will numb the area around the spot before taking a skin biopsy. Then, they’ll insert a thin device or scalpel to remove a tiny piece of skin. Next, they’ll send that skin off to be tested to make sure the spot is benign. The biopsy may cause you discomfort, but you shouldn’t experience any pain. If over-the-counter bleaching creams don’t work for you, a prescription option can help. These creams can fade your age spots in a few months with regular use. For example, your doctor may prescribe a bleaching cream called hydroquinone. In some cases, they’ll pair this cream with retinoids and a mild steroid to speed up the process. If at-home treatments don’t work for you and the brown spots really bother you, there are treatments you can get in a dermatologist’s office. These treatments can be more effective than home remedies. Here are some treatments available to you: Laser or light therapy can fade your brown spots, though you will likely need 2 or 3 sessions to see results. Cryotherapy targets the age spots with liquid nitrogen, which freezes the pigment and breaks it up. You might experience some discomfort with this treatment, and scarring can occur. Dermabrasion and microdermabrasion involve scrubbing off the top layer of your skin, which can fade your brown spots. However, you’ll likely need several treatments, and redness and scabbing can occur. Chemical peels remove the top layer of skin, which is replaced by new skin. With repeated treatments, chemical peels can fade your age spots.

Will we be able to gain energy from lightning? Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"Yes, it is theoretically possible to store the energy of lightning, but capturing and utilizing that energy remains a significant challenge because of various technical, economic, and safety factors. Let me elaborate on these aspects. 1. Unpredictability and Frequency - Lightning strikes are highly unpredictable and sporadic, both in terms of their timing and location. Although certain regions may receive a higher number of strikes, predicting when and where these events will occur is challenging. As a result, deploying infrastructure to capture lightning energy on a large scale is a major logistical constraint. 2. Magnitude and Speed - The energy released in a lightning strike is immense, with each strike carrying about 1 to 10 billion joules of energy and reaching temperatures of up to 30,000 Kelvin. This energy is released in a matter of microseconds, making it difficult to design and develop systems that can handle such high-energy and high-speed events without being destroyed or severely damaged in the process. 3. Conversion and Storage - Assuming a system can successfully capture lightning energy, it then needs to be converted into a usable form like electricity, and stored for later use. This requires efficient conversion mechanisms and energy storage devices, which currently may not be adequate to handle the scale and rapidity of lightning events. 4. Cost and Feasibility - Given the technical challenges and unpredictability of lightning strikes, investing in infrastructure to capture and store lightning energy may not be economically viable compared to other renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy. Moving on to your second question - Will we be able to gain energy from lightning? While we face significant challenges in harnessing energy from lightning, future advancements in technology and materials science might make this prospect more viable. For instance, breakthroughs in energy conversion, storage, and advanced warning systems may improve our ability to efficiently and safely gain energy from lightning. Regarding your last question - Do those questions have the same meaning? The two questions you asked are related but not identical. The first question pertains to the possibility of storing lightning energy, focusing on whether it can be accomplished. The second question ponders our ability to gain energy from lightning, which implies not just capturing the energy but also converting it into a usable form and making it a viable and consistent source of power. In summary, while potential scientific and technological advancements could one day make it feasible to gain energy from lightning, numerous complications and constraints currently make storing and utilizing lightning energy a considerable challenge."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.

What they found per their study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives: \\"Basement radon concentrations fluctuated\\" during that period, \\"but began an upward trend from 2004-2012 in all county categories, higher levels in counties with ≥100 drilled wells vs. counties with none.\\" That roughly coincides with when fracking began in the state: Between 2005 and 2013, 7,469 unconventional wells that use fracking to extract natural gas from shale were drilled there. A press release notes that homes and buildings in the rural and suburban areas where most unconventional natural gas wells are located had a 39% higher concentration of radon than their urban counterparts. The study doesn't pinpoint how the excess radiation got in; study author Joan A. Casey suggests one of three ways: via well water that's been affected by fracking, from air around the wells, or through the natural gas produced by these wells and used in homes. Still, USA Today notes that the study doesn't \\"conclusively prove\\" that fracking lets radon loose in the first place. As for why Pennsylvania, the authors studied it in part because it has one of America's highest residential radon levels; the state sits on bedrock that contains radium, which degrades into radon, the second-leading cause of lung cancer worldwide.","response":"Title: Fracking Potentially Linked to Elevated Radon Levels A new study emanating from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has raised alarm among experts about the potential impact of fracking on radon levels, particularly in our homes. \\"These findings worry us,\\" the study leader commented on the alarming results. The research revolved around data from 860,000 radon readings collected from Pennsylvania homes between 1987 and 2013, using a comprehensive state database. The core of the study explored the effects of fracking, a process of extracting natural gas from shale formations, on the release of radon, an odorless radioactive gas found underground. The published results noted fluctuations in the radon concentrations in basements during the years covered. More notably, there was an upsurge observed from 2004 to 2012 across all county categories. A significant discovery was that counties with 100 or more drilled wells experienced higher radon levels compared to those without wells. This approximate timeline coincides with the onset of fracking in Pennsylvania. Between 2005 and 2013, 7,469 unconventional wells sprung to action, employing fracking to harness natural gas. Simultaneously, rural and suburban locations, where most of the unconventional wells were based, recorded a 39% heightened concentration of radon when compared to urban locations. The study, however, does not offer a definitive explanation as to how the surplus radiation seeped in. Joan A. Casey, the study author, conjectures three potential causes. These are radon infiltrating via well water contaminated by fracking, air surrounding the wells, and the natural gas extracted from these wells and used in residential areas. These findings still do not conclusively prove that fracking creates an avenue for radon to break free, as USA Today points out. Moreover, one may wonder why Pennsylvania was selected for the study. The state is renowned for its high residential radon levels, being perched on a bedrock highly enriched with radium. Radium, over time, degrades into radon, globally recognized as the second leading cause of lung cancer. The implications of these findings necessitate wider discussions on the safety and health repercussions of fracking. Greater scrutiny and further research are essential in understanding the true impact of fracking on radon levels and how these could potentially influence public health, particularly in regions with high radon potential, like Pennsylvania."},{"question":"Q: Question: what is metal music about?

They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency.

You may notice that you sweat a lot more or that you smell very bad. These are not attractive qualities so be sure to shower and wear deodorant every day. Also remember to brush your teeth and style your hair. Keeping basic hygiene makes sure that she does not get grossed out. Always stay fresh and clean even when you're not in school because if you run into her friends in the mall and they think that you smell, the rumour will spread quickly back to her. Without even knowing it, you may have already blown your chance. Take deodorant to school with you, if allowed, in your sports kit on P.E. days. While each girl will like her own specific style, take pride in how your dress. Have confidence in your appearance and know what works for you. You want to feel comfortable in your outfits so that it will be one less thing to worry about. This does NOT mean forcing your friends to ask out a girl on your behalf but it can mean using them to help you look better or find out information about her. It also has the added effect of showing that you are a sociable person and fun to be around. If you aren't friends already, introduce yourself when you are working in a group or when you are sitting next to each other. Talk to her in class, but don't be obnoxious. Don't talk to her too much, just say hi when you find yourself around her or wave if you see her around school. Talk to her whenever the opportunity presents itself. Start by simply asking, \\"How's it going?\\" Don't be creepy or awkward by lingering at her location without saying something. If you have nothing to say, don’t force it. Just greet her and move along. Make sure to make a good impression on them as they are her first line of defense. If she is much more popular than you, or in a different social circle, more effort will be required. Try and talk to that group to get closer to her, and be seen in a different light. A girl is much more likely to go out with you if you have gained her trust and respect on a friendship level. Start slow and chat as acquaintances. Don't be too eager to please her. Leave her intrigued and looking forward to her next encounter with you. Becoming friends can happen by sitting next to her in class, teaming up with her for class projects, interacting with her friends, or getting her number or social media handles to chat. Find a topic that interests you both and chat with her as often as you can. Don't be afraid to ask questions and to change topics so that you can continue the conversation and, more importantly, get to know more about her. Don't try to force a conversation and make things awkward with silence. It's okay to end a conversation if you don't feel like it's flowing in your favour. Try to find common hobbies and interests. For example, you may chat about video games because there are a surprising number of girls that enjoy them as much as boys. Local sports teams are also a great topic to chat about. For example, you can say \\"Hey, did you catch last night's game?\\" If she's sad ask \\"What's wrong\\" and if she doesn't want to tell you about it then say \\"We're friends, you know I would understand\\" Know that you are you're own person and that she should like you for who you are. It's okay to have your own opinion. Disagreeing with her or not liking something that she likes is okay. If she doesn't like you for your opinion then you know it wasn't meant to be, but always respect others and yourself. If your opinion is rude or disrespectful, you may have other problems to address. If you make body jokes, do it in moderation. If you do it too much you will come off as crude and immature. if you do it in moderation you may make her laugh and come off self confident if you joke about yourself.

Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes. The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.The stitching of the binding uses \\"Coptic sewing\\", that is \\"flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)\\" Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards.

(WAVY) — A little boy’s bizarre journey to school Wednesday morning could lead to kidnapping and grand larceny charges against two men, if police can track them down. The boy’s mother told police she left her 8-year-old son in the car while she went into work at the post office on 20th Street in Ghent. When she came back out to take him to school, the car was gone, and so was her son. Within about 15 minutes, police tracked down both the car and the boy. “We found the child at school, unharmed, sitting in the classroom with a smile on his face,” said Officer Daniel Hudson, a spokesperson for the Norfolk Police Department. The boy told officers he was a little scared during the ride, but otherwise unhurt. “The two guys got into the car, saw that he was in the car, and turned around and said ‘Oh, we’re here to take you to school, where do you go to school?’ He said Ghent Elementary, and they took off to Ghent Elementary.” Because the woman had left her cell phone in the car, she was able to track it using the Find My iPhone app. Police found it about three miles away on Silbert Road, but the suspects were gone. Investigators spent the day reviewing surveillance footage from the post office, processing the car for evidence, and canvassing neighborhoods, but as of Monday evening, Hudson said they had developed leads, but still had not identified any suspects. Although it’s legal to leave a car running in a parking lot, and also legal to leave a child alone, Hudson said police could file charges against the boy’s mother. “The investigators are still trying to determine if there was any type of danger to the child while the keys were inside the vehicle, running,” he said. “They don’t want to jump to conclusions, they want to talk with her, figure things out.” ||||| At some point during the school years, parents begin to consider the possibility of self-care for their children. Virginia law is not specific about the age a child may be left home alone, but the decision should never be based on age alone. Remember, leaving your child home alone is an important decision. You are asking your child to take on adult responsibilities and make adult decisions. As a parent, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure the proper arrangement are made for your children. This information is NOT a substitute for parental responsibilities, but are recommended guidelines designed to better prepare your child, your family, and your home for self-care. For more information on Home Alone Safety and any resources displayed on this page, please contact: Social Services: 748-1100 Police Department Child Safety Coordinator: 796-7051 Fire and Life Safety Community Programs: 748-1426 10 THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE LEAVING YOUR CHILD HOME ALONE Virginia law is not specific about the age a child may be left alone, but the decision should never be based on age alone. Determining whether a child and your family are ready for self-care is a difficult first step. Here are some things to consider before leaving your child home alone. Maturity Level: Is your child \\"old\\" or \\"young\\" for his/her age level? Children develop at different rates. Look at your child's physical, mental, & emotional maturity. One child may be able to care for him or herself, while another of the same age may need supervision. Responsibility Level: Does your child use good judgment; follow directions, and complete homework and chores? Look at your child's past performance in carrying out responsibilities as an indicator. Attitude & Feelings: Is your child comfortable staying home alone? Some children feel proud that their parents trust them to be alone, but others feel deserted. How does your child feel about the possibility of self-care? Time of Day: Will your child be home alone in the afternoon, evening, or both? Does your child get scared easily when it is dark outside? Length of Time: How long will your child be in self-care? Some children are capable of being home alone for longer periods of time than others. Start by leaving your child for a short period of time, talk to them about how it went, and gradually work up to longer periods of time. Parental Support: Can you be reached easily at work? How far away are you each day? Does your child feel comfortable coming to you with a problem? There are fewer negative effects of self-care when parents have a strong, caring relationship with their children, and give them consistent direction & support. Community Support: Is there a neighbor or another trusted adult your child can go to or call if there's a problem? It is important to have an identified trusted adult, preferably nearby, know that your child is home alone in case you cannot be reached. Number of Children: How do your children typically interact? Parents must be very clear as to which child is responsible for supervision and teach them appropriate parenting and disciplinary skills. A child who is ready for self-care may not be ready to supervise siblings. Neighborhood Safety: Are there well marked safe places? Is your neighborhood well lit? Can your child safely cross the street? Are there problems with other people in the neighborhood (bullies, crime, or gangs)? Home Safety: Are rules & expectations clearly stated & understood? Have responses to home & medical emergencies been taught & practiced? Children should have clear set limits about what appliances they can operate and how to handle situations such as phone calls and strangers at the door.

The child's mother had left the car keys in the ignition while she worked at a post office, and when she reported the car and her son missing, the authorities put out an alert. The boy was soon found unharmed at his school, Ghent Elementary, after the thieves had asked him where he went to school and dropped him off there. The abandoned car was found three miles away from the school. Two men, Xzavier Evans and Troy Brown, were later convicted of one count of Grand Larceny and one count of Abduction and were scheduled for sentencing on June 17, 2016. The boy had told the police that two unknown men had got into the car, inquired about his school, and dropped him off there. The mother had left her son in the car that morning with the keys in the ignition while she worked at the post office. When she came out around 8 a.m. to take her son to school, the car was gone.

The Burmese then tried to encircle the Chinese by splitting the army into two. Maha Thiha Thura had now assumed the overall command, replacing Maha Sithu. The smaller army, led by Maha Sithu, continued to pursue Ming Rui while the larger army led by Maha Thiha Thura advanced through the mountainous route to emerge directly behind the Chinese. Through careful maneuvering, the Burmese managed to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese at modern-day Pyinoolwin , about 50 miles northeast of Ava. Over the course of three days of bloody fighting, the Bannerman army was completely annihilated. The slaughter was such that the Burmese could hardly grip their swords as the hilts were slippery with enemy blood. Of the original 30,000 men of the main army, only 2500 remained alive and were captured. The rest had been killed either on the battlefield, through disease or through execution after their surrender. Ming Rui himself was severely wounded in battle. Only a small group managed to break through and escaped the carnage. Ming Rui himself could have escaped with that group. Instead, he cut off his queue and sent it to the emperor as a token of his loyalty by those who were escaping. He then hanged himself on a tree. In the end, only a few dozen of the main army returned. How did the Bannerman army soldiers die?","response":"The Bannerman army soldiers died through a combination of factors during the course of the battle and their subsequent defeat. These factors include: 1. The battlefield: Many soldiers were killed during the three days of intense and bloody fighting against the Burmese army. 2. Encirclement: The Burmese army used strategic maneuvering to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese forces, further increasing casualties and limiting escape options. 3. Disease: The harsh conditions and possible lack of proper medical care might have led to the spread of diseases among the Bannerman army soldiers, contributing to their deaths. 4. Execution: After their surrender, some of the Bannerman army soldiers were executed by the Burmese forces. In summary, the Bannerman army soldiers died due to the consequences of the battle, strategic encirclement by the Burmese army, disease, and execution following their surrender."},{"question":"Given the following context: The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical... answer the following question: What is the name of the person to whom Reverend Issac Spencer was a close friend and patron?

His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: \\"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.\\" Context: Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. \\"Went straight through in four years\\", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. \\"I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.\\" After he graduated, he \\"worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory\\". While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After Smith graduated from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records. They were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album, Mic City Sons (1996). Around this time, Smith and Gust worked a number of odd jobs around Portland, including installing drywall, spreading gravel, transplanting bamboo trees, and painting the roof of a warehouse with heat reflective paint. The pair were also on unemployment benefits for some time, which they considered an \\"artist grant\\". Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to the release of Mic City Sons, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser's record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought out by DreamWorks prior to the recording of his fourth album, XO. Question: What happen in 1991 Answer:","response":"In 1991, Steven Paul Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, with a degree in philosophy and political science. Throughout his time at college, despite not particularly wanting to be there, he found interest in his studies and powered through the four years. Smith's decision to attend Hampshire College was initially influenced by his then-girlfriend, and after graduating, he took up a job in a bakery back in Portland, possessing his bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory. During his time at Hampshire College, Smith formed the band Heatmiser along with his classmate, Neil Gust. Post-graduation, the band expanded to include drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson. They began performing around Portland in 1992, released several albums, and eventually signed with Virgin Records. While working on their music, Smith and Gust also held various odd jobs in Portland and relied on unemployment benefits for some time. Smith began his solo career while still a member of Heatmiser, and the success of his first two solo releases led to tensions within the band.

It appears that they know each other and have a friendly relationship. Ben then shares some important information with Peter - he is changing his phone number and provides the new number, which is 917-223-1211. This indicates that Ben wants to ensure Peter can still stay in touch with him after the change, showing that their relationship is important to both them. Peter expresses gratitude for the information and makes sure he's updated on Ben's contact details. To strengthen their bond, Peter then suggests that they should arrange a get-together soon, as they haven't seen each other in a while. Peter's suggestion also signals that he misses spending time with Ben and wants to catch up and maintain their friendship. Ben responds positively and enthusiastically to Peter's suggestion, agreeing that they should meet up soon.

If she spent 133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"To find out how much Zilla deposits into her savings account in a month, we will follow the steps below: 1. Calculate Zilla's monthly earnings. 2. Calculate her total expenses, including rent. 3. Subtract total expenses from her monthly earnings to find out how much she saves. Step 1: Calculate Zilla's monthly earnings Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent. That means 133 is equal to 7% of her monthly earnings. To find her monthly earnings, we will use the formula: Monthly earnings = Rent amount / (Rent percentage) Rent amount = 133 Rent percentage = 7% (note: 7% as a decimal is 0.07) So, monthly earnings = 133 / 0.07 = 1,900 Step 2: Calculate Zilla's total expenses Zilla spent half of her monthly earnings on her other monthly expenses. So, her other monthly expenses amounts to: Other monthly expenses = Monthly earnings * 50% Other monthly expenses = 1,900 * 0.5 = 950 Now, we will add her rent expenses to the other monthly expenses to find her total expenses: Total expenses = Rent expenses + Other monthly expenses Total expenses = 133 + 950 = 1,083 Step 3: Calculate Zilla's savings deposit Finally, we will subtract Zilla's total expenses from her monthly earnings to find out how much she deposits into her savings account in a month: Savings deposit = Monthly earnings - Total expenses Savings deposit = 1,900 - 1,083 = 817 Therefore, Zilla deposits 817 into her savings account in a month."},{"question":"John knew that the pictures were in a box, he put them there for long term storage. He went out and looked for it in what? Options: - closet - basement - post office - water - garage Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"To determine the most likely location where John stored the pictures in a box for long-term storage, we can analyze each option and then come to a conclusion. 1. Closet: Closets are common places for long-term storage in a home, making them a possible location for the box of pictures. 2. Basement: Basements are also known for being used as long-term storage spaces in homes, making this another possible location. 3. Post Office: This option seems unrelated to long-term storage as post offices are meant for mailing services, and not for storing personal belongings. 4. Water: Storing items in water is an unlikely option as it would damage the pictures and the box, which would not be ideal for long-term storage. 5. Garage: Garages are often used as extra storage spaces, so this can be another possible location for the box of pictures. Based on the analysis of each option, we can eliminate the post office and water as plausible locations since they are not related to long-term storage. Now, let's rank the remaining options by their likelihood: 1. Closet: A popular and convenient location for long-term storage in a home. 2. Basement: A common location for long-term storage, but not every home has a basement. 3. Garage: Not as convenient or frequent location for storing pictures, but still a possible storage area. Therefore, it can be deduced that it is most likely that John went out and looked for the box of pictures in the closet, followed by the basement and garage."},{"question":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is the format of the canadian citizenship test Suggested answer: The Canadian Citizenship Test is a test, administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), that is required for all applicants for Canadian citizenship who are aged between 18 and 54 and who meet the basic requirements for citizenship.

Select from: +an atom +a compound +an electron +a mixture. Answer:","response":"A compound is formed when two elements combine chemically. In chemistry, a compound is a substance formed when two or more elements combine chemically, creating a completely new substance that has different properties from the original elements. This combination is undergone via a chemical reaction. In order to form a compound, the elements involved must be in fixed proportions. It's not enough for the elements just to be mixed together. They have to interact and bond, usually through sharing or transferring outer electrons. Two or more atoms join together to create a molecule of the compound. For instance, one atom of nitrogen can react with three atoms of hydrogen to form ammonium (NH3) which is a compound. It's important to note that a compound is different from a mixture (which is simply a physical combination of different substances, not a chemical one) or an atom (the smallest single part of an element) or an electron (a subatomic particle that orbits the atom's nucleus). Compounds exhibit properties entirely different to the elements that constitute them. For instance, sodium is a highly reactive metal and chlorine is a toxic gas. But when these two elements combine chemically, they form sodium chloride - common table salt which is safe to consume. So, essentially, when two different elements combine chemically, they form a compound, which has unique properties and exist at fixed proportions in the compound."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: She says such talk is just being driven by the coming parliamentary elections.","response":"Ea spune că acest tip de discuții este pur și simplu condus de alegerile parlamentare care urmează.

Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Now, I have a new situation: Ants are one of the most interesting creatures on earth. David wants to study ants for his biology project. He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas. First day when he studied the ants the temperature was 10 degree Centigrade. In the second day of his study the temperature rose to 25 degree Centigrade. In the third day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester. Answer this question please: Which day David would see openings in the nest hatch open, third day or fourth day? Answer:","response":"David would likely observe openings in the nest thatch on the third day of his study. This is because Acromyrmex heyeri ants effectively manage their nest's internal temperature and humidity by controlling the airflow through the openings in the thatch. On the first day of his study, the temperature was 10°C, which is lower than the optimal temperature range of 20-30°C for these ants. It is less likely that the ants would create or maintain more openings to regulate temperature since the environment is cooler than their optimal range. On the second day, the temperature rose to 25°C, which falls within the ideal temperature range for Acromyrmex heyeri ants. This is when the ants might start creating more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up to maintain a suitable temperature for the colony. On the third day, the air humidity was high, which makes it more favorable for the ants to maintain the openings in the nest thatch, as it would not lead to significant water loss for the colony. This day, therefore, presents the most suitable conditions for David to observe openings in the nest thatch. On the fourth day, the air humidity dropped, leading the ants to close the openings in the nest thatch to reduce water loss and maintain colony humidity. Consequently, David would observe fewer or no openings in the nest thatch on this day. As David plans to continue his study of the Acromyrmex heyeri species in Asia next semester, it is crucial for him to note that this ant species is native to the New World and may not be naturally found in Asia. David might have to replicate the environmental conditions and conduct his study on ants in a controlled laboratory setting, import the ants from the Americas or consider studying a similar leaf-cutter ant species that is native to Asia."},{"question":"Question: What can happen when kissing outside?

Options: - Sentence A: \\"someone allergic to milk is likely to react to wine\\" - Sentence B: \\"someone allergic to milk is likely to react to cheese\\" Let's be accurate as possible. So think first.","response":"To determine which sentence does not make sense, let's analyze each sentence: 1. Sentence A: \\"someone allergic to milk is likely to react to wine\\" There is no direct relationship between being allergic to milk and reacting to wine. Milk allergies are typically related to the proteins found in milk, such as casein and whey, while wine is primarily made from grapes and does not contain milk proteins. Although in rare cases, some wines may have trace amounts of milk proteins due to the fining process, this does not imply a strong general correlation between milk allergies and wine reactions. 2. Sentence B: \\"someone allergic to milk is likely to react to cheese\\" This sentence makes sense, as cheese is made from milk and contains the same proteins, such as casein and whey, which can trigger an allergic reaction in people with milk allergies. So, in this analysis, Sentence A: \\"someone allergic to milk is likely to react to wine\\" is the one that does not make sense."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Production capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong). What business development did the British use to establish a hold on the global cotton market?","response":"The British used a combination of improving technology and increasing control of world markets to establish a hold on the global cotton market. They developed a commercial chain where raw cotton fibers were initially purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).

Does it follow that \\"Ramses II did not excise his father's name. \\"?","response":"It is not entirely accurate to conclude that \\"Ramses II did not excise his father's name\\" based on the given information. It is essential to examine this statement in a broader context and consider additional factors to accurately assess the relationship between Seti I and Ramses II, their intentions and actions regarding the temple, and the overall historical significance of the temple. Seti I was a notable pharaoh of the 19th dynasty in ancient Egypt and was responsible for commissioning the construction of the temple between 1291 and 1279 BCE. Upon Seti's death, his son Ramses II ascended to the throne and continued the work on his father's temple. Ramses II was unique in that, during his reign, he sought to portray himself as the sole creator of many monumental projects, which perhaps overshadowed the accomplishments of his predecessors. Ramses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, contributed significantly to the temple's architecture by adding colonnaded courtyards, ramps, and other features to its facade. It is true that, in his attempts to surpass his father and assert his legacy, he made considerable efforts to remove Seti's name from the temple walls. However, it is key to note that the process of removing a name or usurping a predecessor in ancient Egypt was not always straightforward or comprehensive. Ramses II might have attempted to erase Seti's name from the walls, but it is impossible to assess the degree of success he had in doing so. In some instances, name removal could be partial or even unintentional, and various factors such as time constraints, available resources, or changes in political climate might have impacted these actions. Moreover, the historical and archaeological records of the temple provide crucial context for understanding the relationship between Seti I and Ramses II. It is worth mentioning that Ramses II might have made earnest attempts to remove his father's name, but ultimately he did not erase Seti's legacy entirely. Seti I remained an influential figure throughout the course of Egyptian history, and his accomplishments, including the construction of the temple, continue to be recognized today. In summary, it is not accurate to conclude that \\"Ramses II did not excise his father's name\\" based solely on the statement given. To fully understand the dynamics between these two pharaohs and their impact on the temple's history, it is essential to consider additional evidence and context, including the manner in which names were removed or usurped, the archaeological findings surrounding the temple, and the broader historical achievements and legacies of both Seti I and Ramses II."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - Adult mushrooms produce spores - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing The answer to this question is:","response":"The mushroom fully develops and matures, eventually producing and releasing new spores to continue the life cycle."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Options: - garbage - linen closet - bedroom - washing machine - livingroom Answer. washing machine What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Answer: Washing Machine Step-by-step reasoning for choosing the washing machine: 1. The comforter has been used constantly: This indicates that the comforter has been exposed to regular wear and tear. As a result, it has likely accumulated dirt, sweat, stains, and odors from its constant use. 2. Treaded upon by everyone: This detail highlights that the comforter has not only been used for sleeping purposes but also stepped on by various people. This further emphasizes the accumulation of dirt, dust, and grime, necessitating proper cleaning. 3. Assessment of other options: a. Garbage: Unless the comforter is severely damaged, worn out, or contaminated to an extent that cleaning is no longer effective or possible, discarding it in the garbage is wasteful. b. Linen closet: Placing a dirty comforter in a linen closet could contaminate other clean linens, and still requires cleaning before future use. c. Bedroom: Putting the comforter back in the bedroom without cleaning it would not address the hygiene concerns caused by constant use and being treaded upon. d. Living room: Much like the bedroom, placing the comforter in the living room does not resolve the need for cleaning. 4. Conclusion: The best option is to place the comforter in the washing machine to effectively clean and sanitize it. This ensures the comforter is fresh, hygienic, and ready for use again. After cleaning, the comforter can then either be returned to the bedroom or linen closet for storage."},{"question":"Question: Information: - A general election was held in the Northern Territory on Saturday June 7 , 1980 .

All sides agree that Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone with President Karolos Papoulias on Friday. A spokesman for the caretaker government, Dimitris Tsiodras, said Ms. Merkel “conveyed to the president thoughts regarding a referendum that could be conducted in parallel to the elections, asking Greeks whether they want to remain in the euro zone.” A spokesman for Ms. Merkel’s government swiftly denied she had called for a referendum, but not before Greek politicians blasted the alleged proposal. The leftist leader Alexis Tsipras accused her of treating Greece like a “protectorate.” The Socialist Party stated that “referendums fall exclusively within the competencies of the government and the Greek Parliament, not the EU or other member states.” The Greek conservative leader Antonis Samaras called it “unacceptable” for Germany’s chancellor to issue such a proposal. The quick condemnation from Greek politicians illustrated unequivocally how raw feelings are in Athens over questions of sovereignty and underscored how the uncertainty over Greece’s future has turned rumors and unconfirmed reports into fuel for even more heated exchanges. The dispute was only the latest fallout from the instability in Greece, which continued to roil markets across Europe. Top European officials also contradicted each other Friday over planning for the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro. In the meantime a leading ratings agency downgraded 16 Spanish lenders. With a caretaker government now in place and only four weeks to go until the next round of parliamentary elections in Athens, a broad effort is underway by Germany and its European partners to make it clear to Greek voters exactly what is at stake when they cast ballots on June 17. Germany finds itself in a delicate position, not wanting to encourage the opposition forces in Athens that failed to form a government after the last election by appearing to interfere in the election, while simultaneously using all possible channels to communicate to Greek voters that their country’s future in the 17-member euro zone depends on electing a government that will uphold its loan agreement with the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Comments by a European Union official, who joined businesses and financial firms in signaling that contingency plans are being drafted to deal with the potential fallout of a Greek exit, pointed to how real the readiness to cut Greece loose may be. “Today there are, both within the European Central Bank and the European Commission, services that are working on emergency scenarios in case Greece doesn’t make it,” the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, said in an interview published Friday in the Belgian newspaper De Standaard. Mr. De Gucht’s comments prompted a rare public rebuke from a colleague, illustrating how the raw nerves are not just in Athens over the uncertainty surrounding Greece, which saw its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by Fitch Ratings late Thursday, on concern over a lack of public and political support for the country’s bailout. “Karel De Gucht is responsible for trade. I am responsible for financial and economic affairs and relations with the E.C.B.,” the vice president of the European Union Commission, Olli Rehn, said during an event in London. “We are not working on the scenario of a Greek exit. We are working on the basis of a scenario of Greece staying in.” European Union offices in Brussels were closed Friday and a spokesman for Mr. De Gucht could not be immediately reached for comment. While continued support for Athens remains the official line, many influential people in Germany would like to see Greece driven from the euro zone, some as an example to other countries and others for what they say is its own good chance to recover. If Syriza, the party that opposes the terms of Greece’s current bailout plan, were to come out ahead in the next election and overplays its hand, it could find itself with an invitation to leave. Shares in Spanish banks fell at the opening of trading, Reuters reported, after the ratings agency Moody’s downgraded 16 lenders late Thursday, citing a weak economy and the government’s reduced ability to support troubled lenders. ||||| In this picture provided by the German Government's Press Office, US President Barack Obama, fourth right, and clockwise: British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev... (Associated Press) The United States and other members of the Group of Eight industrial nations agree that Europe's financial crisis must be addressed with a mix of growth and austerity measures, President Barack Obama said Saturday as leaders gathered for a discussion that also will cover world concerns about ups and downs in oil prices. \\"All of us are absolutely committed to making sure that growth and stability and fiscal consolidation are part of an overall package,\\" Obama said as he and other leaders gathered in shirt sleeves in a rustic cabin at this wooded presidential retreat in Maryland. Obama was referring to the debt crises in Greece and Spain, primarily, although he was not specific in brief remarks to reporters. Leaders of the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Britain, Russia, and Japan are trying to figure out how to tame Europe's debt crisis while also increasing the demand for goods and spurring job growth. Obama's argument for additional stimulus measures alongside belt-tightening is primarily aimed at Germany, the strongest member of the union of European countries that uses the common Euro currency, although Obama did not say so. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was seated a few places away from Obama at a small round table. Leaders of the world's economic powers say Germany should balance its push for European fiscal austerity with doses of stimulus spending to avoid a financial calamity with global repercussions. In talks Saturday, the leaders were looking to build consensus even though a decisive plan of action seemed out of reach for now. \\"We'll also be talking about uncertainty in the energy markets and how to resolve some of those issues,\\" Obama said at the start of discussions on the global economy. Obama chose the secluded Camp David setting in part to give leaders a chance for a freewheeling discussion out of sight of most media and far from the raucous protests that have accompanied previous meetings of the G-8. The G-8 session sets the stage for a far more consequential European summit in Brussels next week where the countries that share the euro as their currency hope to come together on specific steps to fight rising debt while spurring a recovery. The Camp David gathering opened with a Friday evening discussion focused on global trouble spots Iran and Syria. Obama said the session also touched on North Korea's aggression and hopeful signs of democratic change in Myanmar. \\"We are unified on our approach to Iran,\\" and hopeful of progress ahead of a diplomatic meeting with Iran next week, Obama said Saturday. Iran may have a peaceful nuclear energy program but misuse of that program for a nuclear weapon is unacceptable, Obama said. Ever-tighter economic sanctions cannot be loosened while the world encourages Iran to rein in its program, Obama said. \\"All of us are firmly committed to continuing with the approach of sanctions and pressure in combination with diplomatic discussions,\\" Obama said. \\"And our hope is that we can resolve this issue in a peaceful fashion that respects Iran's sovereignty and its rights in the international community, but also recognizes its responsibilities.\\" On Syria, Obama said the group supports a United Nations cease-fire plan that has yet to be honored in full. He said a statement to be issued at the close of the G-8 summit will reflect that support for the plan brokered by envoy Kofi Annan, but also say that the plan has not taken hold fast enough. Most of the leaders are part of overlapping international coalitions formed to address the Iranian nuclear problem and the newer crisis in Syria, where an estimated 9,000 people have died in more than a year of violence that arose from the pro-democracy Arab uprisings. Faced with implacable Russian opposition to significant new United Nations punishments on the Syrian regime, U.S. officials are trying to get consensus among other allies about ways to promote the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. \\"We all believe that a peaceful resolution and political transition in Syria is preferable,\\" Obama said Saturday. A senior U.S. official said one goal of the closed-door discussions at Camp David was to impress on Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that other nations that share Russia's usual role at the forefront of international diplomacy are seeking ways to address the Syria debacle without Russian help. In what has been widely viewed as a snub, Russian President Vladimir Putin is skipping the G-8 summit. He sent Medvedev in his place. Later Saturday the leaders were returning to foreign affairs topics with discussion of Afghanistan and the Middle East. Obama established the tone for the G-8 on Friday after meeting with just-elected French President Francois Hollande, when he said the aim of the summit was to promote both fiscal consolidation and a \\"strong growth agenda.\\" The two leaders, Obama said \\"agree that this is an issue of extraordinary importance not only to the people of Europe but also to the world economy.\\" Hollande, elected May 6 as France's first Socialist president since 1995, advocates more spending to jolt the economy. His predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy partnered with Merkel in leading the eurozone to adopt a raft of austerity measures in response to the continent's fiscal problems. In a hint of the pressures facing the leaders, when Obama greeted Merkel and asked her how she was doing, the German leader only shrugged. \\"Well, you have a few things on your mind,\\" Obama said. A central economic topic, though hardly the only one confronting Europe, is the fate of Greece. That country is facing the most acute financial crisis of the eurozone and is set to hold elections June 17 after a previous vote May 6 resulted in a political deadlock. At issue is whether Greece abandons the euro to escape austerity measures. Hollande, after meeting with Obama at the White House, said, \\"We share the same views, the fact that Greece must stay in the eurozone and that all of us must do what we can to that effect.\\" For Obama, Europe's fate is critical to his own political survival. An economic recession that spreads to the U.S. could damage an already slow recovery and boost the argument by his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, that the United States economy needs new leadership. There is a get-acquainted aspect to the session as well. The Camp David gathering, the largest collection of foreign leaders ever at the presidential retreat, is the first G-8 meeting for Hollande, for Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. ___ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaton contributed to this report. ||||| Photograph by Michael Gottschalk/dapd/AP Photo As President Obama stood beneath an oak tree to greet world leaders at the start of the G-8 summit at Camp David, the heavily guarded presidential retreat in Maryland, one leader refused to smile for the cameras. The arrival ceremony is a tradition at the beginning of diplomatic summits and is usually nothing more than a quick grip and grin for the press. Yet this time, as Obama stood sorrounded by dozens of cameras and even more reporters in front of Laurel Lodge, a green cedar-shingled building at the heart of Camp David, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave a glimpse into the tension surrounding the two-day summit. As Merkel approached, Obama beamed, reached out his hand and said, “Angela.” She responded: “Mr. President.” Things got interesting when Obama asked her, “How have you been?” Merkel simply shrugged and said nothing. In response Obama said, “Well, you have a few things on your mind.” The interaction, which was less than a minute long, underscores the tension sorrounding the meeting where the European debt crisis will be the biggest topic of discussion. At the helm of Europe’s largest economy, Merkel has taken the lead on trying to fix the crisis, and her austerity demands are butting up against calls for pro-growth policies, leading to a fraught 24 hours at Camp David. ||||| CAMP DAVID, Md.—U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday opened the first full day of an international summit taking place amid signs of economic slippage by saying that world leaders were committed to growth and stability. But deep uncertainty greeted leaders of the world's eight richest economies as they gathered here to discuss how to deal with the European debt crisis and fresh concerns that it could spark widespread financial turmoil. Mr. Obama, who welcomed leaders Friday night at this secluded presidential retreat for the start of the Group of Eight summit, intends to urge his counterparts, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to focus less on austerity and more on finding ways to stimulate economic growth. In his first formal comments Saturday morning, he didn't outline specific plans or goals for the talks. \\"All of us are absolutely committed to making sure that growth and stability and fiscal consolidation are part of an overall package,\\" he said, sitting at a wooden table with other leaders beside him in a lodge.

The threat of Greece exiting the euro-zone is heightening worry about economic stability in Europe and the potential for a return to global financial crisis. The issue is expected to dominate the conversations among G-8 leaders, whose first hourlong working session Saturday morning was to focus on the global economy. For Mr. Obama, who can do little more than nudge European leaders toward a solution, an economic crisis in Europe that spreads to the U.S. could be devastating to his re-election campaign. The U.S. economy is closely linked to Europe, and Americans consistently cite economic issues as their top concern in November's presidential election. Mrs. Merkel, Europe's chief driver of austerity, is a focus for Mr. Obama this weekend. White House officials have said he intends to push her to ease her strict preference for budget cutting as more of Europe risks falling into recession. Mrs. Merkel simply shrugged and smiled when Mr. Obama asked her how she has been as he greeted her at Camp David for dinner Friday night. \\"Well, you have a few things on your mind,\\" Mr. Obama told her. The president has some allies in his preferred approach to the European crisis. After his first meeting with new French President François Hollande at the White House Friday morning, Mr. Obama said the two leaders are in general agreement on prioritizing measures to boost economic growth over austerity. Mr. Hollande, like Mr. Obama, prefers implementing budget cuts over a longer period of time than other leaders, such as Mrs. Merkel, have wanted.

On Friday Mr. Obama said G-8 leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, will discuss \\"how we can manage a responsible approach to fiscal consolidation that is coupled with a strong growth agenda.\\" \\"Hopefully we'll get some stuff done,\\" Mr. Obama told Mr. Monti as he arrived for dinner Friday night. The president made clear in his comments Saturday that the leaders would address other issues, including Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, North Korea and the role of women in global society. Mr. Obama said that the leaders \\"are unified on our approach to Iran.\\" He said all agree Iran has the right to a peaceful nuclear program but said that atomic weapons are unacceptable. Still, Mr. Obama said that he and the other G-8 leaders \\"are hopeful\\" about international negotiations with Iran next week in Baghdad, but will maintain sanctions and other forms of pressure. \\"And our hope is that we can resolve this issue in a peaceful fashion that respects Iran's sovereignty and its rights in the international community, but also recognizes its responsibilities.\\" On Syria, he said world leaders support a peace plan put forward by United Nations envoy Kofi Annan but are impatient for compliance by Damascus. He also struck a downbeat tone on North Korea, saying that Pyongyang won't be able to join the world community if it continues violating its international obligations, which he said all leaders agree on. This weekend's G-8 summit is the largest-ever gathering of world leaders at Camp David. The gathering comes ahead of a summit of European leaders next week, in which they are expected to focus on growth-boosting measures to complement the budget accord European officials have developed in recent months. Friday's dinner focused on several of the same issues Mr. Obama mentioned, including Iran, North Korea, Burma and Syria. A senior administration official said there is a sense of urgency surrounding next week's Baghdad talks. Many G-8 leaders will leave for Chicago Saturday night to attend a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization members. Afghanistan will be the main focus of that two-day summit. Write to Carol E.

Answer:","response":"Stefani"},{"question":"Article: Retirement experts nationwide are buzzing about one element of President Obama's State of the Union speech Tuesday night. That's his proposal for the \\"myRA,\\" a retirement account aimed chiefly at lower-income workers whose employers don't offer traditional defined-contribution plans such as 401k's. In many respects the myRA is a welcome idea. But if Obama's goal is to distract policy-makers from more substantial proposals to shore up the American retirement crisis--by expanding Social Security, for example--then it won't cut the mustard. The plan, as the President outlined it in his address and the White House fleshed out a bit more Wednesday, aims to give lower-income workers a way to start building retirement nest eggs in tax-deferred accounts, through regular payroll deductions made by their employers. The employers would have to agree to offer the service to employees. The accounts would be available to those earning less than 191,000, but the minimum initial contribution would be 25 and subsequent contributions could be as little as 5. The money would be invested in a government-backed bond with a yield pegged to the Government Securities Investment Fund offered to federal employees through the government's Thrift Savings Plan, a retirement program. That low-risk, low-return fund yielded 1.47% over the last year and an average 2.24% over the last three years. Like Series EE savings bonds, the myRA bonds wouldn't lose face value, which means the investments would be protected from market losses. But with such low yields they might barely keep up with inflation. Once the accounts reach 15,000 in value, they would have to be rolled over into a conventional Individual Investment Account. That's a sop to the financial services industry, which makes billions from managing IRAS. And that's bad news, says economist Monique Morrissey of the Economic Policy Institute. \\"The president’s plan may serve to channel more savings into a high-risk, high-fee system without first addressing its failings,\\" she wrote on EPI's blog. If the myRA's resemble Roth IRAs, then money invested in them wouldn't be tax deductible, but in most cases distributions would be tax-exempt. The White House says myRA funds could be withdrawn at any time. That may make them more palatable for low-income workers because their contributions wouldn't be tied up until retirement. But it might also encourage people to withdraw money for emergencies or household needs such as college tuition, medical bills or home purchases, which defeats the purpose of having a dedicated retirement account. The proposal complements one that Obama has pushed before, most recently in his 2013 budget, for an \\"auto-IRA\\"--a mandate that small businesses without any other retirement benefits offer workers a simple individual retirement account and sign them up automatically unless they opt out. That program would require congressional approval, which hasn't been forthcoming. The problem with these proposals is that they're only token solutions to the retirement income gap. \\"Instead of putting forward the MyRA proposal and making some noises about auto-IRAs,\\" says Eric Kingson, a founding co-director of the advocacy organization Social Security Works, \\"I wish the president simply focused on the facts about the impending retirement income crisis, or acknowledged, along with his MyRA and auto-IRA rhetoric, that these proposals can, at best, only make a small dent in the larger problem.\\" The myRA resembles, at least in its goals, a program devised by California State Sen. Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles) for \\"California Secure Choice.\\" That's a state-sponsored retirement account for low-income workers funded from their paychecks and guaranteed a modest annual yield. The program has been endorsed in principle by the state legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown, and De Leon is in the process of developing a feasibility study to determine its features. A retirement crisis is looming for millions of Americans. Most households haven't saved enough to keep them secure through their retirement years; they'll be relying heavily on Social Security. That's why support is growing in Congress--albeit from a small kernel--to raise Social Security benefits, an idea being pushed vigorously by Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tom Harkin of Iowa. Harkin also is expected to release a new proposal for a government-sponsored retirement fund as early as Thursday. President Obama's plan is a good start at facing up to the financial crisis facing millions of American retirees and near-retirees. But leaving things at \\"a good start\\" isn't going to be much help to very many people. ||||| President Barack Obama wants to give low-wage workers a new way to save for retirement. His proposal might do some good -- not by helping workers, most of whom are unlikely to take advantage of it, but by spurring a discussion about how to fix a broken retirement system. It’s beyond dispute that the system is failing. Only 1 in 2 workers has access to a retirement plan through an employer. Half of Americans aren’t saving anything at all for retirement. And Social Security benefits, which averaged 1,269 a month in 2013, are barely enough to keep people out of poverty. Obama says he’ll offer workers the chance to direct part of their pay toward new retirement accounts sponsored by the Treasury Department. They’ll have low minimum contributions, returns tied to the yield on government debt, guaranteed principal and no fees. “My Retirement Accounts,” or MyRAs, won’t require congressional approval -- which is good and bad. It’s good because it means something will happen; it’s bad because without legislation, the government can’t make employers offer the plans or tell workers they’re covered unless they choose not to be. Without compulsion or inducements, participation in MyRAs is likely to be small. Fewer than 1 in 10 workers who are eligible to contribute to existing Individual Retirement Accounts bother to do so. Last night, Obama also asked Congress for legislation to create IRAs with automatic deductions and require most employers to offer them. Payroll deductions would still be voluntary as far as workers are concerned, but workers who don’t want to save this way would have to opt out. That would raise the participation rate a lot. But Congress has to go along. The MyRA proposal and the auto-enroll IRA are both good ideas, but neither really measures up to the scale of the problem. Employer contributions to retirement savings, whether in the form of defined-benefit pensions or employer-matched 401(k) plans, have fallen. Without those contributions, especially in programs that encourage or require workers to make contributions of their own, most Americans are saving too little to retire in comfort. Solving this problem is a formidable long-term challenge. It will require wholesale reform of taxes on savings, such that the generous reliefs granted to high-income taxpayers are consolidated, simplified and shifted to those with low incomes, as Obama rightly noted. It will probably require gradual reform of Social Security as well, so that more generous benefits are given to those who need them, with the cost recouped from the better-off through lower benefits and higher contributions. That’s a can of worms that Obama had no intention of opening last night -- but don’t expect the subject to go away. A retirement-savings crisis is coming. MyRAs will help a bit, but the problem will eventually demand much bolder thinking.

Allen jumps into the water, even though he cannot swim. He grasps the hands of a girl who is inexplicably under the water with him and an instant connection forms between the two. Allen can now breathe under water as he is in the hands of a mermaid. However, Allen is pulled to the surface by the deck hands and the two are separated, though apparently no one else sees the girl. After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy). Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy).

The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide.

Premise: \\"A man jumps into a bed that is set up on a public walkway.\\" Key components: man, jumps, bed, public walkway Hypothesis: \\"A female leaps on a bed in a public walkway.\\" Key components: female, leaps, bed, public walkway Step 2: Compare the key components between premise and hypothesis. By comparing the key components between the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe the following: - The subject in the premise is a man, while in the hypothesis it is a female. - The verb \\"jump\\" in the premise is similar to the verb \\"leap\\" in the hypothesis. - Both premise and hypothesis mention a bed and a public walkway. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to evaluate the relationships between the key components identified in Step 2. While both premise and hypothesis mention a bed and a public walkway, the subject (man in the premise and female in the hypothesis) is different. This difference in the subject means that the events described in the premise and hypothesis are not the same. Step 4: Conclusion. Based on the differences found in the key components, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"A female leaps on a bed in a public walkway\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"A man jumps into a bed that is set up on a public walkway.\\" The reason is that the subject in the premise is different from the subject in the hypothesis."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film begins with a 1 million bet between mob boss Michael (Angus Macfadyen) and film producer Jerry Brecken (Tim Matheson) over driving from Los Angeles, CA, to Las Vegas, NV, in under an hour and 45 minutes.

However, the negative emotion appears to be more dominant in this tweet. Step 3: Justifying the sentiment prediction The presence of words like \\"hate\\" and \\"drained out of my life\\" is strong evidence of a negative sentiment, while the use of \\"LOL\\" seems to be an attempt to lighten the mood.

Step-by-step justification: 1. \\"We did so\\" can be translated to \\"Teimme niin\\" in Finnish. This keeps the meaning of the original sentence and conveys that an action was taken based on a reason that will be explained later in the sentence. 2. \\"because\\" can be translated to \\"koska\\" in Finnish. This word connects the actions taken with the reasons for doing them in the sentence. 3. \\"the principle of lifelong learning\\" can be translated to \\"elinikäisen oppimisen periaate\\" in Finnish. In Finnish, the words are in a different order from the English phrase but still convey the meaning of continuous learning throughout life. 4. \\"must of course be\\" can be translated to \\"on tietenkin\\" in Finnish. The word \\"tietenkin\\" implies that the statement is an obvious or expected outcome. 5. \\"supported\\" can be translated to \\"tuettava\\" in Finnish. In this context, it means that the principle of lifelong learning should be backed or promoted by someone or something. 6. \\"and\\" can be translated to \\"ja\\" in Finnish. It connects two related thoughts or actions in a sentence. 7. \\"must be implemented\\" can be translated to \\"on toteutettava\\" in Finnish. This sentence conveys that the principle of lifelong learning must be put into practice and done so effectively. 8. \\"by means of\\" can be translated to \\"avulla\\" in Finnish. This phrase indicates the method by which the action will be carried out. 9. \\"practical measures\\" can be translated to \\"käytännön toimenpiteiden\\" in Finnish.

Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 'It was obvious that he had.': This sentence is a statement, asserting that it was clear that the person in question had indeed done something. Step 3: Determine if Sentence 1 is true Since Sentence 1 is a question, it is not a statement that can be evaluated as true or false. However, it implies uncertainty about the action of the person. Step 4: Evaluate if Sentence 2 is true given Sentence 1's implication If we assume that the speaker's uncertainty in Sentence 1 is justified, then Sentence 2 would not be true, as it states that the person's action was \\"obvious.\\" If the person's action were obvious, there would be no room for the uncertainty expressed in Sentence 1.

Maybe the girl was jealous of your new outfit and said you dress like a skank. Maybe a guy said you're not a good writer because he's jealous that you just published a story. Maybe the person was just in a bad mood and felt like taking it out on someone. Whatever the reason, remind yourself that it had little to do with who you are. Put yourself in the person's shoes. Understand where he is really coming from. Though the words will still sting, it might make you feel better. If your coworker yelled at you for no reason, but you remember that he is going through a divorce, then you'll start to be a bit more understanding, won't you? Okay, so maybe the criticism was delivered in a way that was completely mean, unnecessary, and hurtful, and most of the things that were said were way off base. Maybe your co-worker said you were \\"a complete mess\\" or your friend said you were \\"totally selfish\\" for what you think was no reason at all. Take a minute to think about it, though: do you need to brush up on your organizational skills? Have you been known to be a little selfish from time to time? If so, then maybe you should reconsider your actions without getting hurt by the way the criticism was given. Sure, it's very hard to take someone seriously if they are yelling at you, calling you names, or generally treating you with completely disrespect. This makes it nearly impossible to take a word they say seriously. But if you want to be the bigger person, try to find the underlying message if there is one. What was that thing your mother told you about \\"sticks and stones\\" not being able to break your bones? Sure, you thought it was stupid in third grade, but now, you're a lot older, and it's starting to make sense. In the end, destructive criticism isn't made up of bullets, swords, or atomic bombs -- it's just a series of words connected together in a way designed to make you feel terrible. So, remind yourself that criticism only consists of a bunch of words. Criticism can't steal your money, slap you across the face, or crash your car. So don't let it get to you. The most important thing you can do is maintain your confidence. No matter what people are saying about you, you have to stay strong, remember who you are, and not let other people influence your own self-worth. Being confident doesn't mean thinking that you're flawless, but it does mean loving who you are and how you look. If you're truly confident, then you won't let haters get you down and make you think less of yourself. If you're unhappy with who you are, ask yourself why. Make a list of a few things you don't like about yourself and figure out what you can change. Being confident also means accepting the things you cannot change about yourself. So, you don't like that you're so tall. Do you plan on slouching for the rest of your life, or will you start to love your long legs after all? Hanging out with people who make you feel good about yourself will also go a long way in making you feel more confident. If you're hanging with people who always bring you down, then yeah, you're not going to feel good about yourself. So...you've heard that someone said you're a brown-noser. Will you start participating less in class? Or your co-worker has told you you're too type A. Are you going to stop being who you are if it's working for you? Of course not. If you haven't received a valid criticism and know that what people are telling you is only only being said because of jealousy, anger, or mean-spiritedness, then there's no need to change your routine to please people. If the criticism has no basis whatsoever, then the best thing you can do is to ignore it completely. Don't feel bad if you're not able to push all of these negative words aside right away. It takes practice to stop caring about what people think. What is a summary?","response":"A summary of the article would be: When facing destructive criticism, it's essential to maintain confidence and remember your self-worth. Analyze the reasons behind the critic's words, and if there's any constructive message, consider it without being hurt by the manner it was delivered. Acknowledge that criticism consists of words, and it can't harm you physically or materially. Focus on self-improvement and surround yourself with people who uplift you. Stay true to yourself, accepting things you cannot change and ignoring baseless criticism. Learning to handle negative words takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself."},{"question":"Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) -- Choose your adjective: Hardball. Bare-knuckle. Down-and-dirty.

Some Chinese believe sheep are meek and babies born in that year will grow up to be followers rather than leaders. According to superstition, the children are destined for heartbreak and failed marriages. Chinese couples are in a race against time to have a child in the Year of the Horse instead of 2015's 'dreaded' Year of the Sheep. The Lunear New Year this year, which was celebrated in January, above, marks the Year of the Horse. Like all animals in the Chinese zodiac, the horse sign comes imbued with characteristics, such as vitality, loyalty and adventure. The year of the horse is generally considered an auspicious time. Health professionals say many patients have inquired about early delivery via Caesarean section to ensure a horse-year birth. It has also been noted that fertility consultations have spiked in recent months. The Year of the Sheep begins on February 19, 2015, so the window for conception closes around the end of this month. Some people in China believe sheep are meek and babies born in that year will grow up to be followers rather than leaders. Many couples are desperate to conceive in 2014 - the Year of the Horse - and thousands around the world celebrated the Chinese New Year earlier this year, above.

On the other hand, 2015 was the Year of the Sheep, and some people think that babies born during this year will grow up to be followers, not leaders. They even believe that the Sheep children might have problems in their relationships when they grow up. Because of this, many couples in China tried very hard to have a baby in the Year of the Horse, so their child could have a better future. Some even asked doctors to deliver their babies early, by doing an operation called a Caesarean section. This made clinics busier than usual, as many people wanted help to make sure they could have a baby in the right year."},{"question":"When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life. By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs.

Nevertheless, here's an attempt to provide just that. Firstly, it's key to determine the language you're interested in. There are about 7000 languages spoken today worldwide, and each one has unique structures and rules. From popular ones like Spanish, French and Chinese, to less widely spoken languages like Samoan and Xhosa. As an example, I'll use Spanish, a language that originated in the Castile region of Spain and today has over 460 million native speakers around the world. Here is a sentence in Spanish: \\"El mundo es un libro y aquellos que no viajan solo leen una página.\\" This sentence translates to \\"The world is a book and those who do not travel read only a page.\\" It's a popular quote often attributed to Saint Augustine emphasizing the importance of exploring the world to gain knowledge and understanding. The grammatical structure of the sentence is designed to follow Spanish syntax rules. In English, sentences generally follow a subject-verb-object (SVO) syntax but Spanish, like many other Romance languages, allows for subject-object-verb (SOV) syntax or subject-verb-object (SVO) as well. Also notice the use of accents in the word \\"página\\". These accents are common in Spanish and are used not just for pronunciation purposes but also to create a distinction between words that would otherwise be homographs. Spanish is a language known for its descriptive nature. \\"El mundo es un libro\\", translates to \\"The world is a book\\", it's a metaphorical way to describe the world, not uncommon in romance languages. \\"Aquellos que no viajan solo leen una página\\" (\\"those who do not travel read only a page\\") continues this metaphor, implying that experiencing the world through travel is like reading more of the 'book' and expanding one's understanding. So, in a single sentence, we've touched upon Spanish linguistic characteristics, it's use of metaphor, and even a cultural perspective about travel being a form of education. If we were to use another language, say Japanese or Swahili, the sentence and corresponding explanation would be quite different based on their unique traits."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to survive and enjoy being an expatriate Know what to expect.

Solve -367*r = -360*r - 14 for r.","response":"Okay, little buddy, let's solve this step by step! We have this problem: -367*r = -360*r - 14 Our mission is to find the value of \\"r\\". Step 1: First, let's add 360*r to both sides of the equation (to get rid of the -360*r on the right side) -367*r + 360*r = -360*r + 360*r - 14 After adding, we get: -7*r = -14 Step 2: Now, we just need to find the value of \\"r\\". We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -7. (-7*r) / -7 = -14 / -7 After dividing, we get: r = 2 So, the value of \\"r\\" is 2.

Appearing at Londonderry Magistrates' Court on Monday, a 36-year-old man was denied bail in connection with the incident. Martin Neeson, from Magowan Park, is charged with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH). He is also charged with possessing a knife with intent to cause GBH. The alleged victim was still in a critical condition and on a life support machine in hospital, a police officer told the court.

In American society, will a bachelor's degree often include a leap year? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: yes?","response":"The question seems to be conflating two unrelated concepts: a bachelor's degree in American society and the occurrence of a leap year. To justify the answer \\"yes,\\" I'll attempt to find a connection between these two concepts and demonstrate how a bachelor's degree might be related to leap years. Step 1: Explain the concept of a bachelor's degree A bachelor's degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities. It usually takes 4 years to complete the degree with full-time enrollment. During these years, students study a range of disciplines to gain fundamental knowledge and skills in their chosen subject area. Step 2: Explain the concept of a leap year Leap years occur in the Gregorian calendar system, where every 4 years, an extra day (February 29) is added to the calendar. This adjustment accommodates the fact that the Earth takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the Sun. By incorporating a leap year, the calendar year aligns more accurately with the solar year. Step 3: Attempt to connect the concepts of a bachelor's degree and leap years One potential connection could be made by considering the time it takes to complete a bachelor's degree program. Since most programs take four years to complete, it is quite likely that a student pursuing a bachelor's degree will experience at least one leap year during their course of study. Step 4: Synthesize the reasoning Since a bachelor's degree in American society typically takes four years to complete and leap years occur every four years, it can be deduced that a bachelor's degree often includes a leap year. This connection, however, is purely coincidental and does not imply any direct relationship between the attainment of a bachelor's degree and the occurrence of a leap year. Therefore, the answer is yes: In American society, a bachelor's degree will often include a leap year."},{"question":"Answer the following question: how many episodes of the sinner have aired?","response":"As of now, 24 episodes of The Sinner TV show have been aired.

The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff. She and Rampion barely escape in time to observe the fiery birth of a second moon. Its release stops the crack from further splitting the Earth.

Article: If you live in a big city, there are many thing to drive you crazy on your daily route, and it's not just overcrowded subway trains. Vicky Zhao is a mainlander working in Hong Kong. For her, one thing she can't put up with is people standing on the wrong side of the escalator in subway stations. \\"Escalators help us move faster and save time. It isn't a place to rest,\\" the 24-year-old says. \\"I often see tourists block the way with their suitcases or chatting on the escalators during rush hours. _ annoys me to no end.\\" Admitting she is not the patient type, Zhao says things are much better in Hong Kong than in cities on the mainland where \\"stand right, walk left\\" signs are often ignored. The logic behind the \\"stand right, walk left\\" escalator etiquette seems obvious. Even though you may want to catch your breath while you're transported up or down, you should still consider others and leave enough space for people in a hurry, so that they can run and catch the train. Many cities' escalators, including London's and Beijing's, use the \\"stand right, walk left\\" system to speed up the flow of people. (Australia is an exception and you should stand on the left side instead.) But some cities discourage people from moving on escalators out of safety reasons. In Hong Kong's subway stations there are regular announcements asking people to \\"stand still\\" on escalators. Even so, most people in thisfast-paced cityobserve the \\"stand right, walk left\\" etiquette. But the people who stand on escalators defend themselves by telling the walkers not to be so impatient. The BBC quotes one stander as saying: \\"If the person is in such a rush, why not just take the stairs? Even when the escalator is packed and there's nowhere to move, I see these same people complaining about not being able to pass.\\" Whatever the escalator etiquette is in the place you live or visit, do what most people are doing and always be mindful of others: leave enough space between each other, don't stay at the end of the escalator, and if someone is blocking...

Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio.

Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

Watching TV: If your friend has a television and the environment permits, this might be a decent option to pass the time. If there are mutual interests in a particular show or a movie, this can work as a bonding activity as well. However, if the goal is to engage more deeply with your friend, watching TV might not be the most interactive option. 2. Socializing: This seems the most suitable option in the context of being at a friend's house. If you're bored, it's likely that the level of interaction or the depth of the conversations isn't satisfying. Engaging in more meaningful or exciting discussions or suggesting fun activities could alleviate the boredom and strengthen the friendship. It's always beneficial to communicate how you're feeling openly. 3. Go Somewhere: This could be another potentially good option depending on the situation. If the weather is nice and there are interesting places nearby to visit, such as a park, a museum, or a coffee shop, it could be an enjoyable excursion. However, this might not always be possible, considering various factors like constraints of time, availability of transportation, or differing interest levels. 4. Jump Rope: While it's a great physical activity and good for health, it's quite specific and may not be suitable unless you and your friend are in the mood for some physical activity or exercise. This would also depend on whether there's enough space in your friend's house or a suitable outdoor area nearby where you could jump rope without causing any disturbances. 5. Cleaning the Room: Generally, cleaning the room is more of a chore than an activity one might engage in when bored, unless you and your friend enjoy organizing spaces together. Doing so without their permission could come across as invasive, so it's important to ask before you start cleaning up. In conclusion, among the provided options, 'socializing' is the most versatile and universally applicable option. It allows for a deeper connection, mutual understanding, and shared joy which is generally the purpose of a friendly visit. If socializing doesn't alleviate the boredom, discussing other options with your friend should be the next move. The key is open communication and mutual consent before picking any activity."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: chandelier, hang, home","response":"After a long day of work, Sam couldn't wait to return home, where, in his spacious living room, he recently decided to hang an elegant crystal chandelier, transforming the ambiance of his sanctuary and elevating it to an epitome of sophistication and style."},{"question":"How do you do this: shot glass","response":"A shot glass is a small glass typically designed to hold or measure liquors and spirits, which are either consumed straight from the glass (\\"a shot\\") or poured into a mixed drink. Shot glasses typically hold 1.5 ounces (44 ml) of liquid, although sizes can vary slightly depending on the design and manufacturer. The process of using a shot glass is simple, but below is a detailed guide on how to use one properly. 1. Choose the appropriate shot glass: Shot glasses are available in a wide variety of designs and sizes, from the traditional plain glass to elaborate novelty designs. If you plan on using the shot glass to measure a specific volume of alcohol or for a mixed drink, choose one that clearly marks the volume held, such as a jigger. If you're just using it to enjoy a straight shot of liquor, you can choose any glass that you like. 2. Hold the shot glass: With one hand, take hold of the shot glass between your thumb, index, and middle fingers. Ensure you have a firm grip on the shot glass, especially if it's a thicker or heavier design. This will prevent any spills when pouring the alcohol. 3. Pour the alcohol: Hold the shot glass steady and angle it slightly to prevent splashing when pouring. Carefully pour the liquor of your choice into the glass. If you're measuring a specific volume, pour until the liquid reaches the marked line. 4. Serve the shot: If you are serving a shot to a guest, place the filled shot glass on a coaster or bar surface and gently slide it toward the guest. Alternatively, you can hold the glass out and allow the guest to take it from your hand. 5. Drink the shot: When consuming the shot yourself, grasp the shot glass with your dominant hand. Raise the glass to your lips in a smooth motion, and then quickly tip it back, allowing the liquor to flow into your mouth. Swallow the liquid in one go and then lower the shot glass back onto the table or coaster. Remember to consume alcohol responsibly and know your limits. 6. Clean and store the shot glass: After the shot is consumed, rinse out the glass with warm water to remove any residue. If necessary, gently scrub the inside with a soft sponge to remove any stubborn stains. Once the shot glass is clean, pat it dry with a clean cloth or allow it to air dry. Store the shot glass with your other drinkware in a cool, dry place until your next use. In conclusion, using a shot glass is a simple process that involves selecting the appropriate glass, holding it steady, pouring the preferred liquor, and consuming the liquid responsibly. By following these steps, you can ensure a pleasant shot-drinking experience, whether you're enjoying a social gathering or mixing drinks at home."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The doll could not be placed into the toy store because the Available choices: + doll was too proper. + store was too proper.","response":"Once upon a time, there was a beautiful doll that was very proper. It wore a fancy dress, shiny shoes, and its hair was always perfectly styled. Everybody who saw the doll was amazed by its elegance and grace. One day, a toy store decided that they wanted to sell this lovely doll. However, there was a problem: the store itself was also too proper. The store only sold toys with very straight postures, neatly combed hair, and tidy outfits. They even played classical music in the store for the toys to enjoy. The doll, being so proper, seemed to fit in perfectly with the other proper toys. But the store owners worried that the doll might outshine all the other toys and make them look less proper. To solve this problem, the store owners brought the situation to their most important customer, a young boy named Tommy. They thought, \\"If anyone can make a fair decision about where the doll should go, it's Tommy, because he knows everyone at our store.\\" Tommy pondered the situation for a moment and made a suggestion. \\"What if the doll became the store's mascot? This way, the store will continue to be known as the most proper toy store and the doll can be admired by all customers who walk in?\\" The store owners loved Tommy's idea. They set up a beautiful display at the front of the store, and placed the doll as the store's mascot. This way, the doll was able to stay in the proper toy store and bring joy and admiration to all who visited. And from that day on, the elegant doll was the star of the store and helped make the toy store even more enchanting than ever before. Together, they created a magical world where proper toys could live happily ever after."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 210*v - 219*v = 117*v - 1512 for v.","response":"Let's solve the equation step by step: 1. First, we need to simplify the equation by collecting like terms. On the left-hand side, we have 210*v - 219*v, and on the right-hand side, we have 117*v - 1512. 2. We can subtract the v coefficients on the left-hand side: 210*v - 219*v = (-9)*v Now the equation looks like this: (-9)*v = 117*v - 1512 3. Next, we'll get all the \\"v\\" terms on one side of the equation by adding 9*v to both sides: (-9)*v + 9*v = 117*v - 1512 + 9*v 0*v = 126*v - 1512 4. Now, we need to isolate \\"v\\" on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll divide both sides by the coefficient of \\"v\\" (126): 0 = v - (1512 / 126) 5. We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1512 and 126, which is 126: 0 = v - (12 / 1) 6. Finally, we'll add (12 / 1) to both sides of the equation to solve for \\"v\\": v = 12 So, the solution to the equation 210*v - 219*v = 117*v - 1512 is v = 12."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Edo, 1630. Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him.

Question: What is the long term result of the armistice Context: The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.

An indictment filed in the case detailed interactions between group members as they swapped and commented on images. \\"My thanks to you and all the others that together make this the greatest group of pedos to ever gather in one place,\\" Freeman wrote in response to one posting, according to the indictment. And a posting from Castleman, cited in the indictment, read, \\"Thanks to all for the wonderful material that has been posted.\\" An Australian constable who infiltrated the group in August 2006 was among 50 witnesses testifying at trial. He told the jury that the group traded more than 400,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse before being dismantled by law enforcement, according to the Justice Department statement. Each defendant faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, fines and the possibility of supervised release for the rest of their lives, authorities said. The seven will be sentenced April 14.

Eating Well AN ANTHROPOLOGIST as well as an authority on Mediterranean cuisines, Paula Wolfert has written a string of award-winning cookbooks, such as “Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco” (1973) and “The Cooking of Southwest France” (1983), that dive deep into the cultures she’s studied. While other food writers were flocking to Tuscany or Provence, she said, “I’d go alone ‘over there,’ ” to less-traveled Tangier, say, or Gascony. “If there’s one thing that describes the story of my life, that’s it. I want to go ‘over there.’ ” Her latest project, “Unforgettable: Bold Flavors from a Renegade Life,” is her most personal by far. Diagnosed with Alzheimer’s three years ago, Ms. Wolfert, 77, has entrusted the telling of her story and the assembling of 50 of her favorite recipes to fellow food writer Emily Kaiser Thelin, following a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to put the biographical cookbook together. It will cover a remarkable career right up to the present moment, as Ms. Wolfert manages the disease in the place where she feels most comfortable—her kitchen—by preparing “brain-healthy” foods she hopes will combat the progress of dementia. At her Sonoma, Calif., home, Ms. Wolfert talked to us about her new routine, her enduring obsession with clay pots and what she learned from having her coffee grounds read. The first thing people notice about my kitchen is: how huge it is. I wrote “The Cooking of Southwest France” in a closet in New York City. I used to keep the food in pots on the floor in the living room. But when we moved out here we tore down two walls to make a giant kitchen. I told my husband I wanted a work table that was so large I could never reach the center. And that’s what I have. The dining room is right off the kitchen, so there’s no privacy. I can’t spill anything! My brain-healthy diet starts with: a big glass of water with a pinch of Hawaiian sea salt in it, first thing in the morning. I then make myself a cup of Bulletproof coffee. It’s black coffee with high oxathiane coconut oil and Kerrygold sweet butter. The butter and oil in the coffee fill me up until lunchtime. And my doctors explain that your brain is 75 to 80% fat, and what you want to do is get energy from fat rather than from sugar. The tool I reach for the most is: my Vitamix. It’s my favorite piece of equipment. My husband gave it to me for my 75th birthday, when I decided I was going to get into smoothies. I call them “gritties” now because the texture is no longer smooth. I use a combination of greens, nuts, blueberries and avocado and a huge amount of supplements, all liquified with coconut water. My refrigerator is always stocked with: salmon or fresh albacore tuna, flown in from Vital Choice in Alaska. I have fish three times a week, an omelet with vegetables one time a week, and meat or fowl, such as chicken livers, the other days. I try to have six or seven in-season vegetables on hand, which I cook together with a lot of spices and herbs. I am a collector of: clay pots, and I have been since 1956. It’s a hobby. I’ve given away so many, but I probably still have 100. My favorites aren’t the most romantic ones. The reason I like them is they can go in the dishwasher. They are earthenware, and they are made in America by Clay Coyote. They cook beautifully. I do sometimes use my tagines, but I mostly just look at them fondly now. I bought my first clay pot in New York on Sixth Avenue and 18th Street. I asked the woman who sold it to me: “What’s that?” And she said, “It’s a tripière. It’s for cooking tripe.” And I said, “What’s tripe?” My primary cooking mentors were: Dione Lucas and James Beard. My mother gave me six lessons with Dione Lucas when I was at Columbia University. I loved it. I loved it better than school. I grew up on cottage cheese and melon, and my mother was on a diet her whole life. She had no interest in food. But I loved it. I told Dione, “I want to work for you.” She said, “You can’t. You’re in school.” And I said, “I’ll quit school.” She said, “I’m not going to pay you.” But that was fine. I worked for her for nine months, and at the end of nine months I got married and spent our entire wedding money on kitchen equipment. Then I worked for James Beard, and I got paid anytime I did anything for him. At the end of that summer, though, my husband and I decided to leave for Tangier. Beard wasn’t happy that I left. If I’m not in my kitchen, I’m: either at yoga or meditation. Or I am meeting friends. I have a gang of women—a “lunch bunch.” We are all in our 70s except for one. All of them are still working. We go to lunch once a week on Tuesdays and we hang out together for the day. A language I’d like to learn is: Turkish. The one word I know is esprili. It means quick and witty. It reminds me of the chef Musa Dagdeviren. We are great friends, but he doesn’t speak a word of English. He once gave a birthday party for me of 26 dishes from his restaurant. When everybody was leaving, he sat down with me and my friend, who was my translator, and read my coffee grounds. He said, “Quick, spit on the grounds!” I asked why and he said there were two women in America plotting against me! And I could stop them by doing this. Esprili is exactly the word that describes him. I love him and I love this recipe that he taught me. —Edited from an interview by Kathleen Squires What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"Paula Wolfert, an anthropologist and celebrated cookbook author diagnosed with Alzheimer's, is focusing on a brain-healthy diet to help combat the progress of dementia.

Control of its spread is typically attempted through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents.

Which continent killed less plankton? Big continent used more air polluting substances, while Small continent was very protective towards the environment. Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","response":"The Small continent killed less plankton. This is because the Small continent was more protective towards the environment and did not use as much air polluting substances as the Big continent. As a result, the Big continent experienced a hole in its ozone layer due to the release of chlorine and bromine gases from aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Ozone depletion leads to higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, which kills plankton and disrupts ocean food webs. Since the Small continent was more environmentally friendly, it had lesser impact on the ozone layer and therefore killed less plankton compared to the Big continent."},{"question":"What is a shorter version of this: fifa has expressed its welcome sunday to the european union 's recognition that sport was \`\` special '' but said it wanted further progress on the issue of player transfers .

The given premise states that \\"a man is on a horse in front of an audience.\\" While this situation could occur in a circus, there are also other scenarios where this premise might hold true. For example, the man could be in a horse show, a rodeo, a historical reenactment, or even a political rally.

Alaska. Answer:","response":"Title: Bridging Alaska Genre: Drama, Adventure Plot: Our story begins with Chester Davis (played by Chris Evans), a wildlife photographer in his mid-30s, living a successful life in Los Angeles. Although he has money and fame, deep down, Chester feels a void in his life. He yearns for purpose beyond materialistic success. In an effort to change his life, Chester decides to take a significant break from his LA life and embarks upon a journey to Alaska to explore its natural wonders. Upon arrival, Chester meets Amara Clarke (played by Zoe Saldana), a local tour guide, and environmental activist. Amara agrees to show Chester around the Alaskan wilderness. The two instantly develop a strong bond as they come to realize their shared love for nature. As the days turn to weeks, Chester becomes increasingly captivated by Alaska's stunning landscapes and the way life thrives there. He finds particular interest in the diverse wildlife, focusing on capturing the beauty of their existence on his camera. Through his artistic eye, Chester begins to expose the harsh effects of climate change on Alaska's fragile ecosystem. During their journey, Amara introduces Chester to her grandfather, Joseph Clarke (played by Morgan Freeman), a wise and respected indigenous Alaskan elder. Joseph shares with Chester the ancient knowledge and traditions of the native people whose lives have been deeply connected with the land for generations. Chester's appreciation for Alaska deepens, and he begins to question what it truly means to be home and what he can do to protect this newfound paradise. One day, Amara brings Chester to a secluded island known for its unique fauna and flora. Unbeknownst to them, a corporation has plans to build a bridge connecting this island to the mainland, leading to the imminent destruction of the incredible biodiversity found there. Chester and Amara discover the corporation's plans and embark on a quest to expose the proposed bridge's environmental impact and protect the island for future generations. As public awareness of the issue grows, Chester uses his fame and platform to advocate against the bridge and further explore the effects of climate change on the region. He joins forces with Amara and other environmental groups to rally the local community to protest the bridge's construction. The story garners national attention, forcing the corporation itself to reconsider its plans. In the end, Chester's efforts lead to the cancellation of the bridge project, saving the island and its unique ecosystem, thus emphasizing the power of people united for a cause. Having fulfilled his purpose, Chester decides to return to Los Angeles but promises to come back and continue his work in Alaska with Amara and her community. As the story concludes, Chester is seen back in LA, changed by his Alaskan journey. Through his experiences, he has learned that home isn't just a physical place, but rather where your heart and purpose lie. The movie wraps up as Chester displays his stunning Alaskan photographs in a gallery, inspiring others to care for our planet and its diverse ecosystems. \\"Bridging Alaska\\" not only highlights the vulnerability of our world's natural beauty but also shows that one person's determination and passion can inspire a world of change."},{"question":"Solve 1517*z + 768 = 1453*z for z.
