The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan. A:","response":"The full name of the person who is credited with very few works is Hubert van Eyck. He was initially attributed to the panel in question, but it has since been definitively attributed to his brother, Jan van Eyck.

As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him. When Stoddard, the naive \\"pilgrim\\" (as Doniphon dubs him), opens a law practice in town, Doniphon and many others believe him crazy for inviting retribution from Valance, who cannot abide any challenge to his \\"authority\\". Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie.

Although the caique is a medium-sized bird, it needs a great deal of space. Select a cage that can accommodate this energetic parrot.","response":"1. Research proper cage dimensions. To create an ideal habitat for your caique parrot, it is important to know the recommended cage dimensions for this specific species. Ensure space for the bird to comfortably move, play, and spread its wings. Typically, a cage measuring at least 24x24x36 inches (LxWxH) is appropriate. 2. Select cage materials and design. Choose a cage made of a non-toxic and durable material such as stainless steel or powder-coated metal. Ensure that the cage has horizontal bars for your caique parrot to climb, with a bar spacing of no more than 0.5-0.75 inches (1.2-1.9 cm) to prevent the bird from getting its head stuck. 3. Set up cage in a suitable location. Place the cage in a well-lit, secure, and quiet area of your home, away from direct sunlight, drafts, and extreme temperature fluctuations. It's ideal to keep the cage in a high-traffic area to promote socialization and keep your parrot engaged. 4. Provide perches of varying thickness. Add multiple perches of varying thicknesses, materials, and textures to promote proper foot health and exercise for your caique parrot. Natural branches, rope perches, and wooden dowels work well for this purpose. 5. Add toys for enrichment. Caique parrots are highly intelligent and playful, so providing them with a variety of toys is essential for their mental and physical wellbeing. Offer puzzles, foraging toys, and toys made from wood, ropes, and soft materials for chewing and tearing. 6. Set up food and water dishes. Place at least two dishes in the cage for food and water, and use heavy or hanger-style dishes to prevent your caique from knocking them over. Stainless steel or ceramic dishes work best for easy cleaning and durability. 7. Create nesting and resting areas. Provide your caique parrot with a comfortable and secure place to sleep, rest, and potentially nest. Provide a nesting box, hanging tents, or even soft blankets for your bird to cuddle into. 8. Maintain cleanliness. Regularly clean the cage, perches, toys, food, and water dishes to maintain a sanitary environment for your caique parrot. Remove droppings, uneaten food, and any dirt or debris to prevent bacterial growth, pest infestations, and potential health problems. 9. Monitor temperature and humidity. Keep the temperature around 70-80°F (21-26°C) and the humidity between 40-60% for your caique parrot's comfort. Use a thermometer and hygrometer to monitor both temperature and humidity levels. 10. Provide proper nutrition. Research and plan a balanced diet for your caique parrot, which should include a mix of pellets, fruits, vegetables, and occasional seeds and nuts. Offer variety and consult with an avian veterinarian to determine the specific nutritional needs of your bird. By completing these steps and providing a safe, entertaining, and comfortable habitat, you'll ensure a happy and healthy environment for your caique parrot."},{"question":"E-Glass – sewing threads are also available with V4A reinforcements.

Parque Rodó, a prominent public park located in Montevideo, Uruguay, was designed with heavy influence from French-style city parks that were popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In order to create a comprehensive space for public use, architect and landscape designer Carlos Thays incorporated various elements characteristic of French-style city parks. These elements included formal gardens, statues, fountains, tree-lined streets, and picturesque walkways. Thays, an Argentine-French landscape architect, was greatly influenced by his education and experience in France. His work on Parque Rodó showcases the influence of the European country's landscape design tradition. Furthermore, Parque Rodó was designed not only for aesthetic appeal but also to serve as a gathering place for cultural, recreational, and social activities. Typical of French-style city parks, many events and activities are hosted within the park, including outdoor theater performances, art exhibitions, and handicraft fairs. In conclusion, the statement effectively answers the question by confirming that Parque Rodó was originally conceived as a French-style city park. This design, characterized by various features including formal gardens, statues, fountains, tree-lined streets, and picturesque walkways, aims to create an appealing public space rich in cultural, recreational, and social activities."},{"question":"If The program plans to build, develop, and test six additional development units during 2002 and 2003 that will incorporate design changes to fix the system failures., can we conclude that \\"The design changes in the program were critical to preventing failure.\\"?","response":"In order to conclude that \\"The design changes in the program were critical to preventing failure\\", we need to analyze the situation step-by-step.

Is The term szlachta is derived from the Old High German word slahta (modern German Geschlecht), which means \\"(noble) family\\", much as many other Polish words pertaining to the nobility derive from German words—e.g. a good answer to this question?","response":"Yes, your answer provides an appropriate and detailed explanation for the origin of the term szlachta. To elaborate, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had a unique political system that was closely tied to its noble class, known as the szlachta. This term indeed comes from the Old High German word slahta (which evolved into modern German as Geschlecht), meaning \\"(noble) family.\\" The szlachta played a crucial role in the central European region during the early modern era. They were not only the aristocracy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but also the political elite, as many of their members were elected to key positions and had a strong influence over the decisions of the country. As a result, the szlachta had a significant impact on the shaping of Polish society, history, and culture. In fact, several other terms connected to the Polish nobility are derived from the German language. This can be attributed to the strong historical, cultural, and economic ties between Poland and Germany over the centuries. As these connections continued to develop throughout the Middle Ages, many Polish words and terms were influenced by their German counterparts. This was particularly true in the realm of governance and politics since German law significantly influenced the legal systems in the region and helped to shape the principles of the Polish nobility. For instance, the Polish words rycerz (\\"knight\\") and rada (\\"council\\") both come from German (Ritter and Rat, respectively). This linguistic influence is evident even today and serves as a reminder of the central-European region's entwined history. In summary, the term szlachta originates from the Old High German word slahta and is connected to the noble families and aristocracy of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Additionally, various Polish words related to nobility share German roots due to the strong historical ties between the two cultures. Your answer effectively guides the reader to understand the etymology of szlachta and its significance in Polish history."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: Fludarabine Russian:","response":"Флударабин"},{"question":"Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that said the album released in 1982 offered a middle ground between funk and jazz? A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.

He has been with the band since 1988. He is also the vocalist of the band Sarke. He currently works in Norway as a school teacher, and has a son and a daughter. He has also released a documentary film called \\"The Misanthrope\\" in which he deals with black metal music and life in Norway. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Gylve Fenris Nagell (born 28 November 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician and politician who is best known as being one half of the metal duo Darkthrone. Although primarily a drummer, he has also performed bass, guitar and vocals for Darkthrone and a number of other metal bands. Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet. - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\") are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890 1937). - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen. - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\"). - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes. - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned .

Based on the concept of Israel, the question asks about the type of government present in Israel. Israel operates as a parliamentary representative democratic republic. This means that the country's government is based on the principles of democracy, where citizens elect representatives to the legislative body, known as the Knesset. The Knesset is responsible for making and passing laws, as well as electing the President and approving the government led by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the head of government in Israel and holds significant executive powers. Israel's political system includes multiple political parties, ensuring a competitive political environment, where governance is formed based on coalitions between different parties. The President of Israel, meanwhile, serves as the head of state with a primarily ceremonial role. I hope this provides a comprehensive understanding of the type of government that exists in Israel without needing further research."},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph.

Solve this instance: Background Paragraph: Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C. Story: To reenact James Watt's experiment, John sealed some water in a container. He called this stage of his experiment as stage A. Then he started heating the water in the sealed container. He labeled this stage as stage B. Once the temperature reached hundred degree centigrade, he added more heat to it. He called this stage as stage C. Once all the water has turned into steam, he kept adding heat to it. He called this last stage of is experiment as stage D.

I got to know people by the flowers they planted that I had to remember not to cut down, by the things they lost in the grass or struck in the ground on purpose. I reached the point with most of them when I knew in advance what complaint was about to be spoken, which request was most important. And I learned something about the measure of my neighbors by their preferred method of payment: by the job, by the month--or not at all. Mr. Ballou fell into the last category, and he always had a reason why. On one day, he had no change for a fifty, on another he was flat out of checks, on another, he was simply out when I knocked on his door. Still, except for the money apart, he was a nice enough guy, always waving or tipping his hat when he'd seen me from a distance. I figured him for a thin retirement check, maybe a work-related injury that kept him from doing his own yard work. Sure, I kept track of the total, but I didn't worry about the amount too much. Grass was grass, and the little that Mr. Ballou's property comprised didn't take long to trim . Then, one late afternoon in mid-July, the hottest time of the year, I was walking by his house and he opened the door, mentioned me to come inside. The hall was cool, shaded, and it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the dim light. \\"I owe you,\\" Mr Ballou said, \\"but...\\" I thought I'd save him the trouble of thinking of a new excuse. \\"No problem. Don't worry about it.\\" \\"The bank made a mistake in my account,\\" he continued, ignoring my words. \\"It will be cleared up in a day or two. But in the meantime I thought perhaps you could choose one or two volumes for a down payment. He gestured toward the walls and I saw that books were stacked everywhere. It was like a library, except with no order to the arrangement. \\"Take your time,\\" Mr. Ballou encouraged. \\"Read, borrow, keep, or find something you like. What do you read?\\" \\"I don't know.\\" And I...

So, our simplified equation is: 33*d + 198 = 0 Step 3: Solve for d Now, we want to isolate the variable d by moving non-d terms to the other side of the equation. First, we'll subtract 198 from both sides of the equation: 33*d + 198 - 198 = 0 - 198 This simplifies to: 33*d = -198 Now, to isolate d, divide both sides of the equation by 33: d = -198 / 33 Step 4: Perform the calculation -198 divided by 33 equals -6: d = -6 Answer: The value of d is -6."},{"question":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella. A final sequence (in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself) suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog. Answer:","response":"Elsa Brinkman starts to fall in love with director Lewis Zarkan during the filming of the movie in which she portrays Lylah Clare. Despite Zarkan's primary focus being on finishing the film, he engages in a relationship with Elsa, which further intensifies her connection with her role as Lylah."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you will be given a list of integers.

Today, we're going to learn about a fun event that happened in Sheffield. Do you know who Jarvis Cocker is? He's a very famous man who sings songs and talks on the radio too! He is the frontman of a band called Pulp, which means he's the main person who sings in the band. They made lots of fun and popular songs that many people enjoy listening to. And guess what? He recently did something exciting with trams in Sheffield! Trams are like long buses with lots of wheels that run on tracks, like a train. They go around the city taking people to different places, like school or the shops. In Sheffield, where Jarvis Cocker is from, they have special announcements that play on the tram to let people know where they are going. These announcements are usually made by a recorded voice, so everyone can hear clearly and know when to get off the tram. Now, Jarvis Cocker has used his cool voice to re-record those announcements for the Sheffield trams! That means that instead of hearing the old voice telling them where they are going, people on the trams will hear Jarvis Cocker's voice instead. Doesn't that sound fun? Imagine hearing your favourite singer's voice when you're on the tram going to a fun place in the city! Why do you think Jarvis Cocker did this? It's because he loves his city Sheffield and wanted to make people smile as they travel on the trams. It's a special way of showing that he cares about the people who live there, and he wants to make sure they have a good day, just like you do when you help your friends or family!

Vole farm grew organic produce and produced organic milk, while Anthill farm did not possess the USDA organic certification. and a hint : As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. Please answer this question : Which farm had more antibiotic resistant pathogens? A:","response":"Vole Farm (organic) or B: Anthill Farm (non-organic) Based on the given information, it is likely that: B: Anthill Farm (non-organic) had more antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The reasoning behind this is that organic farming practices, as followed by Vole Farm, do not permit the use of antibiotics as a preventative measure. This results in fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens on organic farms.

And I was wondering How would you describe Skylar? The answer is:","response":"Skylar, as described, appears to be an individual who, for a considerable period, demonstrated a consistent pattern of unprofessional behavior, lack of commitment, and inadequate work ethic. Some specific traits and tendencies that characterize Skylar's actions in the workplace include: 1. Irresponsibility: By frequently skipping work and neglecting their duties, Skylar showcased a lack of responsibility when it comes to fulfilling professional commitments. 2. Disregard for consequences: Skylar's continuation of this behavior over several years indicates that they either did not fully grasp or chose to ignore the potential consequences of their actions on their career and reputation within the organization. 3. Laziness: Consistent reports of Skylar's lack of effort in performing assigned tasks illustrate a general unwillingness to invest the necessary time, energy, and focus to achieve success and meet performance expectations. 4. Lack of team spirit: Skylar's persistent absence and negligence likely had a negative impact on their colleagues, who may have been required to shoulder additional work or cope with delays and inefficiency that resulted from Skylar's behavior. 5. Poor adaptability: Despite being provided with ample opportunities to amend their behavior and improve their work ethic, Skylar seems to have been reluctant or unable to make the necessary changes for personal and professional growth. 6. Unreliability: Over time, Skylar's track record of underperformance and frequent absence likely led to a loss of trust and confidence from peers and supervisors, making them an unreliable team member in the eyes of others. 7. Resistance to feedback: It is plausible that Skylar may have received feedback or warnings regarding their performance and conduct, yet chose not to take corrective actions, further highlighting their resistance to learn and grow from constructive criticism.

San Diego, California (CNN) -- In Washington, a lot of the meetings that take place between lawmakers amount to nothing. But recently, there was a get-together that was really something. The participants: Reps. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, and Charles Gonzales, D-Texas, along with Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey. The problem: What this country should do with so-called DREAM'ers, undocumented young people who were brought here by their parents as children and who face the threat of deportation. One proposed solution that didn't go anywhere was the DREAM Act, a bill that politicians passed around like a hot potato for more than a decade. It would offer legal status and a pathway to citizenship to anyone who goes to college or joins the military. Rubio might have enough leverage within his party to persuade some Republicans who voted against the old DREAM Act to support","response":"a revamped version of it. As an influential voice among conservative Republicans, Rubio's support for the DREAM Act could sway those in his party who were originally opposed. Analyzing the previous standpoints of the Reps and Sens involved in the meeting, and given Rubio's unique position within the party, a comprehensive strategy was put forward by Rubio to restore the DREAM Act but with significant amendments. The proposed amendments include enforcing stricter qualifications for the beneficiaries, such as specific academic achievements, military service requirements, and well-defined age limit to qualify as a DREAMer. Additionally, Rubio proposed a more stringent vetting process to scrutinize immigrants' backgrounds and merits, therefore, including only those individuals who demonstrate potential value to the American society and economy. His modifications put greater emphasis on identifying individuals who both contribute to society and align with American values. Moreover, Rubio is also advocating for an incremental approach to the immigration situation. Instead of granting immediate citizenship, his proposal aims to put the DREAM'ers on a long-term pathway to attaining legal status and eventually, citizenship. This has the potential to ease concerns among conservative party members about an immediate influx of new citizens. The parties agreed on the urgent need for immigration reform, and this new approach might, for the first time, provide a middle ground upon which both Republicans and Democrats can agree. This refreshed view of the DREAM Act under Rubio's strategic leadership seems to offer a solution that not only increases the chances of the Act's approval but also bridges the gap between the two parties' perspectives on immigration. This is the right ending to the passage because it presents Rubio's possible influences and contributions to the amendment and prognosis of the DREAM Act, based on the given meeting's context. It also provides potential solutions to the problem discussed in the passage, suggesting a way for both parties to reach a consensus on immigration reform."},{"question":"Q:Q: Birds generally practice what kind of relationship, with both parents helping to care for the young?

FOX Latin America is the American version of the Latin American broadcaster FOX . 2. Fox Latin America is the Latin American version of the American channel FOX . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"On the surface, it may seem that these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, as they both discuss the relationship between FOX Latin America and its American counterpart, FOX. However, closer examination reveals some differences in emphasis, which make these sentences convey slightly different meanings. Sentence 1 states that \\"FOX Latin America is the American version of the Latin American broadcaster FOX.\\" In this sentence, the emphasis is on FOX Latin America being an American version of the original Latin American FOX broadcaster. This suggests that FOX Latin America operates under American influences and primarily adapts its content for the American audience. Sentence 2, on the other hand, states that \\"Fox Latin America is the Latin American version of the American channel FOX.\\" In this case, the emphasis is on FOX Latin America being a Latin American version of the American channel FOX. This implies that it is an adaptation of the original American FOX channel specifically for the Latin American audience, incorporating local culture, preferences, and content tailored to the region. In summary, while both sentences address the connection between FOX Latin America and the American channel FOX, they do so with different focal points. Sentence 1 emphasizes FOX Latin America's American influence, while sentence 2 underscores its Latin American nature as an adaptation of the American channel. Because of these subtle differences in emphasis, it would be inaccurate to say that the two sentences are strict paraphrases of each other.

Wind is caused when air moves from a high pressure area to a low pressure area. Since weather moves in from the west, westerly winds indicate good weather because they suggest the bad weather is already to your east. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Air moves from low pressure to high pressure areas to create wind. \\"?","response":"No, based on the paragraph provided, we cannot conclude that \\"Air moves from low pressure to high pressure areas to create wind.\\" In fact, the paragraph states the opposite: \\"Wind is caused when air moves from a high pressure area to a low pressure area.\\" To further clarify this concept and provide a detailed explanation, let's discuss how wind is generated and the factors affecting it. Wind is the movement of air that occurs as a result of differences in atmospheric pressure, which is essentially the weight of air molecules pressing down on the Earth's surface. When there is a difference in pressure between two areas, the air naturally moves from the area of higher pressure (more dense or heavier air) towards the area of lower pressure (less dense or lighter air). This movement occurs because the atmosphere strives to balance out uneven distribution of pressure and achieve a state of equilibrium. There are several factors that contribute to wind formation, including temperature, air pressure, and the Earth's rotation. The uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the sun is the primary driving force behind air pressure differences. Warm air rises and creates low-pressure areas, while cooler air sinks and contributes to high-pressure areas. As a result, air molecules attempt to disperse evenly across the Earth's surface, creating wind as they move from high pressure to low pressure. The Coriolis effect, caused by the Earth's rotation, also plays a role in shaping wind patterns. In the Northern Hemisphere, this force causes winds to rotate counterclockwise around low-pressure areas and clockwise around high-pressure areas. In the Southern Hemisphere, the directions are reversed. This effect gives rise to global wind patterns, such as trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies. To predict the weather without a forecast, observing the direction of the wind can be helpful. As the paragraph mentioned, westerly winds often indicate good weather in many locations because they suggest that the bad weather (low-pressure system) is already to the east. However, it is essential to understand that local topography, proximity to large bodies of water, and seasonal variations can impact wind patterns and, by extension, weather predictions. As such, relying solely on wind direction may not always yield accurate weather predictions without considering these factors. In conclusion, based on the given information, we should state that \\"Air moves from high pressure to low pressure areas to create wind.\\" Observing wind direction, along with other local and global factors, can help in predicting weather scenarios without a forecast."},{"question":"Denny asked: Test for natural language inference.

He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music. He started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. Born Walden Robert Cassotto in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York City, Bobby Darin was reared by his maternal grandmother, whom he believed was his mother. Darin's birth mother, Vanina Juliette \\"Nina\\" Cassotto (born November 30, 1917), became pregnant with him in the summer of 1935 when she was 17. Presumably because of the scandalous nature of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in that era, Nina and her mother hatched a plan to pass her baby off as Nina's younger brother. Years later, when Nina finally told Darin the truth about his upbringing, she refused to reveal the identity of his biological father, and kept the secret to her death in 1983. Darin's maternal grandfather, Saverio Antonio \\"Big Sam Curly\\" Cassotto (born January 26, 1882), was of Italian descent and a would-be mobster who died in prison from pneumonia a year before Darin's birth. His maternal grandmother, Vivian Fern Walden (also born in 1882), who called herself Polly, was of English ancestry and a vaudeville singer. From his birth, Darin always believed Nina to be his older sister and Polly his mother. But in 1968, when he was 32, Nina told Darin the truth, reportedly devastating him. By the time he was a teenager, Darin could play several instruments, including piano, drums, and guitar. He later added harmonica and xylophone. Darin moved to the Bronx early in his life (with a rented summer home in Staten Island) and graduated from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science. In later years he attributed his arrogance to his experiences there, where he was surrounded by brighter students who teased him.

The police filing — obtained exclusively by Celebuzz — details “suspicious circumstances, possible unlawful sex with minor,” according to the officer who spoke to Chris Workman, Winter’s mother, on October 6. Celebuzz has chosen not to name Winter’s boyfriend, who was identified by the young star’s mother and told to law enforcement. “On 09-24-12, at approximately 2200-hours, she walked in the guest bedroom of her home and found her daughter, Ariel Winter Workman, in bed with boyfriend, [Name Redacted],” the three-page report claims. Workman told the Sheriff explicit details about what she saw when she walked into the room at her Montrose, Calif. home. Celebuzz has chosen not to report the full recollections of Workman because of the graphic account. “The informant (Workman) said the guest bedroom door was left wide open when she walked in,” Workman told police. “According to the informant, Ariel and [Name Redacted] have been boyfriend/girlfriend for approximately 5 months. She has attempted to break them up because of their age difference.” Winter nor the boyfriend have not responded to a request for comment from Celebuzz. In an earlier statement on Thursday, Workman claimed her teenage daughter’s relationship with the man, four years her senior, was the real reason behind the young actress’ decision to ask a judge to temporarily place her in her sister’s care. According to court papers, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge put Winter, who plays teenager Alex Dunphy on the Emmy-winning TV comedy, under the temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. Workman told Celebuzz she “caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand.” “I put a stop to it immediately,” Workman said. “I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment. “I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die.” In the incident report, the officer noted that he had been unable to speak with Winter and her guardian, Gray. “I was not able to contact Ariel because she is currently living with her older sister, Shanelle Gray, somewhere in Studio City,” the Sheriff wrote. “The informant does not have much of a relationship with her daughter Shanelle and does not have her address or telephone number. In addition, Ariel recently changed her cellular number. She did not give her number to the informant.” The officer said he also tried to call the boyfriend and his mother but was unable to make contact with either of them. “The informant mentioned that on 10-03-12, Ariel contacted The Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS). Ariel alleged that her mother (Informant) abused her. The informat has not yet been contacted by DCFS. The officer added: “I asked the informant why she did not report the incident when it occurred. She said, at the time she was uncertain as to what she wanted to do. She wanted to seek advice from her friends and her attorney. She was advised by her attorney to notify law enforcement.” – Additional Reporting by Andrea Simpson Winter’s family is divided after the claims hit headlines on Thursday — as this Celebuzz video explains, below.

Chris Workman, Winter’s mother, told Celebuzz in an exclusive statement that she “caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand.” “I put a stop to it immediately,” Workman added, revealing she pressed charges against the unknown male teenager. It is not known what charges were filed, or with what law enforcement agency. “I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment,” Workman told Celebuzz. The mother did not elaborate further about what the alleged “behavior” was between the pair. “I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die,” Workman said. According to court papers filed on October 3, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge put Winter, who plays teenager Alex Dunphy on the Emmy-winning TV comedy, under the temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. Workman was alleged to have slapped and emotionally abused her daughter, according to the website TMZ. Winter was removed from her mother’s home and her sister will retain guardianship until a November 20 court hearing. In her emotional statement, Workman said Winter’s sister came “out of the woodwork” once it was announced the cast were to receive substantial salary increases. The Modern Family cast filed a lawsuit in a bit to better their deals to appear on ABC’s top-rated comedy. Said Workman: “She has only seen her little sister maybe ten times in the last fourteen years. “They have no relationship and her motives are not out of love, but out of spite. She had problems as a child and she and I have maybe seen each other a dozen times in the last twenty years. “I made a conscious decision years ago to distance her from the family because of the lies she told on me so many years ago. “I never wanted her unstableness to effect Ariel or anyone else in the family.” The distraught mother of the promising starlet added: “My biggest nightmare is now being played out in the public arena for people to make judgments on me and my daughter and our family. I only hope that as quickly as this blew up, that it will go away just as fast and Ariel will come home and we can move forward with love as a family.” Workman’s full statement to Celebuzz reads as follows: “I love my daughter very much. I would never abuse her in anyway and I have always tried my best to always protect her and do what is right for her. My daughter is in a business that requires you to grow up fast. It’s hard enough being a teenage girl, but it’s even harder when you are in the public eye. However, because you are in the public eye, it doesn’t mean you are no longer in need of good parenting. My fourteen year old daughter has been dating a eighteen and half year old man and when I caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand and fully grasp I put a stop to it immediately. Being a teenager “in love” I thought she would cry and sulk and eventually her broken heart would heal. I would have never of dreamed, that she would take it to this level. Yes, I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment. I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die.” “As for my estranged daughter, who has come out of the woodwork once it was announced that the kids on the show got a big raise recently, I will only say this, she has only seen her little sister maybe ten times in the last fourteen years, they have no relationship and her motives are not out of love, but out of spite. She had problems as a child and she and I have maybe seen each other a dozen times in the last twenty years. I made a conscious decision years ago to distance her from the family because of the lies she told on me so many years ago. I never wanted her unstableness to effect Ariel or anyone else in the family. My biggest nightmare is now being played out in the public arena for people to make judgments on me and my daughter and our family… I only hope that as quickly as this blew up, that it will go away just as fast and Ariel will come home and we can move forward with love as a family…” In the court papers, Winter accused her mom of “ongoing physical abuse (slapping, hitting, pushing) and emotional abuse” that included name-calling and insults about her weight. – Additional Reporting by Andrea Simpson Winter’s family is divided — as this Celebuzz video explains, below.

TMZ has learned -- because they think the mother is making up stories of an illicit sexual relationship to save face after she was stripped of custody.TMZ broke the story ... a judge determined allegations thatwas physically and emotionally abusing Ariel were so serious, he awarded temporary custody to Ariel's older sister -- and ordered Chrystal to stay 100 yards away from her young daughter.Law enforcement sources tell us they're not buying Chrystal's claim Ariel was involved in a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old boy, largely because the mom never went to cops until AFTER she lost custody on October 3 -- even though she claims the affair's been going on since the beginning of summer.Court sources tell us the first time Chrystal mentioned ANYTHING about an illicit relationship was during the guardianship hearing last month ... when she began ranting in court and called the guardianship lawyer a \\"moron.\\"We're told she testified about a specific incident on Sept. 24, saying ... \\"I caught my daughter with her boyfriend in bed -- she's 14. He's 18 and I threw him out and I broke them up.\\"Due, in no small part, to the timing of Chrystal's testimony ... one law enforcement source tells us they don't believe there was ever a sexual relationship between Ariel and the boy. ||||| There's nothing funny about Modern Family funnygal Ariel Winter's family travails. The 14-year-old has been removed from her mother's care following allegations in court documents of physical and emotional abuse, and now the star's adult sister is seeking permanent guardianship over her sibling. Police have confirmed to E! News that an active investigation is under way but declined to provide additional details. E! News has also learned that the detective handling the case is with the special victims bureau. Herewith, a guide to the key players in Ariel's family drama. ||||| It’s the real-life Modern Family feud that has turned ugly. In yet another twist in the allegations of parental abuse involving young star Ariel Winter, the family’s pediatrician has signed a letter defending the woman accused of delivering years of emotional and physical abuse, Chris Workman “There has never been any evidence of an abusive relationship in regards to Ariel,” John Rodarte, M.D. wrote a letter dated Oct. 18, 2012, two weeks after the 14-year-old asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to place her under the guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. The doctor added, “Ariel ‘Winter’ Workman has been a patient of ours since 1998. Her mother has always been conscientious in bringing Ariel to her appointments.” As Celebuzz exclusively reported, Workman has claimed the real reason her daughter went to court was because she attempted to break-up her daughter and her older boyfriend. Indeed, Winter’s mother filed an incident report with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department allegedly caught her 14-year-old daughter engaged in a sexual act with an 18-year-old man, who Celebuzz has decided not to name. A missive from a second pediatrician was also provided to police and the court to defend Workman against claims she abused Shanelle Gray, too. Virginia-based pediatrician Carl Hanfling, M.D. wrote, in a a letter dated May 27, 1994, that he “never observed… negligence or child abuse.” “Shanelle Workman has been a patient of mine since birth,” Hanfling said. “I or my staff have never observed any suggestion of negligence or child abuse. On the contrary, both parents have always demonstrated extraordinary concern and have been loving, caring mother and father.” According to court papers filed Oct. 3, Winter claimed her mother subjected her to “ongoing physical abuse (slapping, hitting, pushing) and emotional abuse (vile name-calling, personal insults about minor and minor’s weight, attempts to ‘sexualize’ minor, deprivation of food, etc.) for an extended period of time”. Faced with the allegations, a judge not only granted temporary custody but also ordered Workman not to come within 100 yards of her daughter. A representative for Winter did not want to comment about the case or the police filing when approached late on Thursday. In the incident report we obtained, police noted “suspicious circumstances, possible unlawful sex with minor,” following the interview with Winter’s mother on October 6 — three days after the minor went to court. “On 09-24-12, at approximately 2200-hours, she walked in the guest bedroom of her home and found her daughter, Ariel Winter Workman, in bed with boyfriend, [Name Redacted],” the three-page report claims. Workman told the Sheriff explicit details about what she saw when she walked into the room at her Montrose, Calif. home.

Should I validate this answer? A:","response":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer as it does not directly answer the question about the type of spider with the most eyes. Instead, let me provide you with an appropriate and detailed answer to the question: Spiders belong to the taxonomic class Arachnida, and the order Araneae. They have a range of eye configurations, typically possessing 2 to 8 simple eyes referred to as ocelli. The actual number of eyes, their arrangement, and their size can vary significantly among different spider species. Most spiders have eight eyes, though some species may have fewer or none at all. To address the question of which spider has the most eyes, it’s important to first understand that not all spider species have been thoroughly studied, and new ones are still being discovered. Among the known species, there isn't a specific type of spider that consistently has more eyes than others. However, most spiders have eight eyes in various arrangements, and this could be considered the \\"most eyes\\" in the general sense. Jumping spiders (family Salticidae) are renowned for their keen eyesight, predominantly facilitated by their large anterior median eyes, which are highly specialized for capturing sharp, focused images. These spiders have an additional three pairs of smaller eyes providing peripheral vision. Thus, jumping spiders have eight eyes in total, similar to the majority of other spiders, making it difficult to identify a particular type of spider with more eyes than others. In conclusion, there isn't a specific type of spider with the most eyes, as the majority of spider species possess eight eyes. Jumping spiders are notable for their distinctive eye configuration, with their larger anterior median eyes contributing to their exceptional vision. However, this does not increase the overall number of eyes they have compared to most other spiders."},{"question":"In this task you will be given two dialogues.

Here's a detailed breakdown of this step: 1. Place the ice cube tray on a flat and stable surface, such as a countertop or table. Ensure there is enough space around the tray to avoid any potential spills or accidents. 2. Slightly twist or bend the sides of the tray to loosen the ice cubes. This action will help break the bond between the ice cubes and the tray, making it easier to remove them. You can also hold the tray under warm running water for a few seconds to help release the cubes, but be cautious not to melt too much of the ice. 3. Turn the tray upside-down over a container or surface where you will collect the ice cubes, and give the tray a gentle tap to dislodge the cubes. If some cubes still don't come out, give the tray another slight twist or bend and repeat tapping until all the cubes are released. 4. Once the ice cubes have been removed from the tray, you can use them immediately in drinks, coolers, or other desired applications. If you wish to store the ice cubes for future use, transfer them to a resealable plastic bag, container, or an ice bin in your freezer. Ensure the storage container is airtight to prevent moisture from entering, which can cause the ice cubes to stick together or develop freezer burn. 5. After you have dealt with the ice cubes, wash and dry the ice cube tray. If you plan to make more ice cubes, refill the tray with water and place it back in the freezer. If not, store the clean and dry tray until the next time you need to use it. Remember to handle the ice cube tray carefully to avoid any spills, accidents, or damage to the tray itself, and always practice proper hygiene when dealing with food-related items, such as ice cubes."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87. He was hailed \\"The last great Victorian\\", and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, 300 yards (270 m) south of Postman's Park, on 7 July 1904.On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial...

It is important to note that specifying \\"for ten days\\" conveys that the ten-day period is continuous and uninterrupted. To further understand the context and ensure the conclusion is justified, let's examine the information provided: 1. The statement \\"It lasted ten days\\" indicates the duration of an event, which we know to be ten days in length. This statement provides essential information about the event's temporal nature. 2. When you rephrase this statement as \\"The event lasted for ten days,\\" you are maintaining the same meaning and context. The use of \\"for\\" in this instance emphasizes the continuous period during which the event occurred. In conclusion, it is correct to assume that if an event lasted ten days, you can accurately express this by saying, \\"The event lasted for ten days.\\" Both phrases convey the same information: the event had a continuous duration of ten days. However, depending on the context and the level of formality required, you may choose one phrase over the other. In general, both phrases successfully communicate the ten-day duration of the event in question."},{"question":"Manson (upper body) will be in the lineup Sunday against the Oilers, Derek Van Diest of the Edmonton Sun reports.

Therefore, this option isn't the best choice Option B: \\"bike was too old\\" This option ties in with the boy's desire to ride his bike to his new job. It makes more sense that the bike being too old could be a reason why the boy is unable to ride it to his job. It provides a logical obstacle that keeps him from fulfilling his wishes.

It was a thrilling clash between the two English football league teams that saw the hosts walk away with another win, as the visitors were left to contemplate their future after the disappointing loss. First Half: The first half began with excellent energy from both sides, as each displayed their drive to secure a victory on this crucial game for the season standings. Early pressure from Colchester forced a series of saves by Notts County's impressive goalkeeper, but it was Shola Ameobi who eventually broke the deadlock. The experienced forward intercepted a misplaced back-pass from Colchester’s defense, and neatly tucked the ball into the net, claiming the first goal for the Magpies in the process. The first half continued with end-to-end action, but neither team managed to add to the score before the referee blew his whistle for the interval. Second Half: As the game resumed, Colchester’s desperation to get back into contention was palpable. In an effort to level the score, they pushed forward, searching for holes in Notts County’s defense. However, this provided an opportunity for the home side to counter-attack, and Ameobi was once again in the thick of it. A fine piece of teamwork and an astute cross from the right wing allowed Ameobi to rise above his marker and head the ball past the goalkeeper, doubling the lead for his team in the process. Despite their two-goal deficit, Colchester refused to give up. In the following minutes, they managed to create several scoring opportunities and even hit the woodwork on one occasion, but lady luck seemed to have deserted them. As the minutes ticked away, both teams made substitute changes resulting in a different pace to the game, but the score persisted at 2-0 in favor of Notts County. Post-Match Analysis: Shola Ameobi was undoubtedly the standout player at Meadow Lane that day, as his two remarkable goals earned his team the crucial win and consolidated their current form. For Colchester, luck simply did not seem to be in their favor as they failed to convert any of their numerous attempts into goals. There were, however, some promising performances from the younger players in their squad, leaving fans with optimism for the future. The victory was a crucial one for Notts County, who managed to secure their third successive win on the bounce and boost their position within the league table. They will be hoping to continue this remarkable form against their upcoming opponents in an attempt to make it to the playoffs. As for Colchester, their inability to bounce back from the early setback proves costly, leaving their playoffs hopes severely dented. While they still have a number of games left to salvage the situation, the loss at Meadow Lane has undoubtedly created a major uphill battle. They will need to regroup and devise a plan to make up for the lost points and keep their chances of a playoff spot alive. Conclusion: The action-packed encounter between Notts County and Colchester showcased the beauty of football, as Shola Ameobi’s brace guided the home side to a much-needed win that put them in a stronger position in the race to the playoffs. Colchester will now have some serious soul-searching to do as they attempt to reignite their campaign and maintain hope for a successful season outcome."},{"question":"On the other side sits the silhouettes of a few round hills , above which was lit up with twinkling stars , so many that I could not count .

That is one possible reason for a number of encounters in the San Francisco Bay Area recently, where motorists in Stinson Beach and Bolinas have complained about coyotes chasing passing cars, snapping at tires, and even bringing traffic to a halt. Some now believe that the behavior may be caused by the ingestion of the fly amanita mushroom. “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” an anonymous commuter told The Pacific Sun. The fly amanita is a poisonous mushroom with hallucinogenic properties that are commonly consumed by coyotes and dogs. Looking much like the classic toadstool, the fly amanita can cause a wide variety of psychedelic effects when ingested and is taken as a recreational drug in many countries. However, the mushroom must first be parboiled before it can be eaten safely. As a result, most dogs or coyotes that eat the mushroom suffer from the effects of poisoning, such as vomiting and nausea. In worst cases, canines who consume the mushroom will experience seizures, bleeding, liver failure, and ultimately death. The psychedelic effects of the mushroom on canines are not well-documented, but experts say that they can be especially excitable after consumption. That fits with the accounts given by drivers on Highway 1, who say that the coyotes have been acting stranger than normal. Most healthy coyotes, as with any other animal with a keen self-preservation instinct, do not dart in and out of traffic trying to bite cars. The psychedelic mushrooms are just one theory, and not exactly the most plausible. Since the hallucinogenic properties of the mushrooms only last temporarily, it may not explain why the coyote encounters have been reported for weeks. Experts with a local animal shelter said that alternate explanations include rabies, which is also unlikely, or that motorists have simply been feeding the coyotes. Feeding any wild animal, least of all a dangerous predator, is never advised.

The attacks are weird enough that one seemingly outlandish explanation, that the coyotes are eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and vision questing their way into interactions with drivers, is being considered. A report in the Pacific Sun details the late-night encounters had by numerous motorists. \\"A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway,\\" notes the paper, \\"before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle.\\" “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” one driver told the Sun. Experts aren't sure what's behind the abnormal behavior, but they are sure of one thing: It's not rabies. It seems that the attacks have been going on for a period of time longer than an animal infected with the virus could be expected to live. Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the Marin Humane Society, told the Sun that \\"[if] this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.” The attacks have been reportedly occurring for the past three weeks. “We are trying to figure this out,” Bloch helpfully informs us. The Sun notes that the fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) grows in the area and has hallucinogenic properties, and that Bloch recently warned residents about the possible side effects of their pets eating the wild fungus. Bloch, for her part, suggested a more prosaic possibility: Drivers have been feeding the coyotes from their cars. “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand,” she explained. Which, when we consider that this is Bolinas we're talking about, seems in the end the likeliest of explanations. Related: Dogs Make Terrible Stoners, Are Probably Mooching All Your Weed Stash ||||| By Tom Gogola West Marin residents have lately been reporting a strange sight on Highway 1 near the Slide Ranch turnoff. It’s all the talk at Beth’s Community Kitchen in Bolinas and elsewhere: A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway, before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle. The coyote “attacks” have happened a bunch of times, to enough people, to warrant calls to figure out what’s going on with the animal. Or, animals, as the latest grist out of Bolinas has it that there are now two coyotes acting a little weird, or a lot weird: Drive-by coyote stare-downs have now become part of the normative experience for a Bolinas-based individual who makes numerous nighttime airport runs every week. We are not identifying this individual, who fears retribution at the vengeful paws of these bushy-tailed beasts. He would only say, “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold.” The Marin Humane Society has fielded at least one inquiry from a coyote-concerned citizen and is looking into the case of the aggressive coyote, says Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the society. “We are trying to figure this out.” There are three possible scenarios to explain the behavior, ranging from least probable, kind of fun to consider and most probable. The least probable problem with the coyote, or coyotes, is rabies. This sort of “Old Yeller” type of aggression usually comes at the end-stage of the disease, the “terror stage” or “zombie stage” of rabies, at which point the animal is going to die, Bloch says. These coyote attacks have been going on for at least three weeks. If it were rabies, Bloch says, the coyote would likely be dead by now. “If this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.” Whew, it’s not rabies. It is possible, but not probable, that the coyote has eaten something—perhaps a fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) which has hallucinogenic properties—and has subsequently been tripping its tail off. The cars would therefore be some sort of coyote vision, a dark vision of human interlopers, who must be stopped before the rents get any higher in West Marin. That would be kind of cool. Bloch could not completely rule out the possibility that coyotes are having psychedelic experiences out on the feral fringes of civilization, and in fact she has been counseling dog owners of late on the dangers of poisonous mushrooms in our midst. Coyotes hold a special, spiritual place for many a West Marin resident and Bloch urges those of a coyote persuasion to keep a safe distance from the beast of lore. The animals were eradicated in these parts through the 1950s because of their deleterious impact on cattle, but now that they’re back in force—yip-yip, you need to give the beasts some space. The state estimates that there are between 250,000 and 750,000 coyotes in California. Bloch notes that while the animals are native to the county, “there were not coyotes in Marin for decades” because of a United States Department of Agriculture program that completely annihilated the Marin-based population. “When you indiscriminately kill predators, you are messing with the ecosystem.” Coyotes’ staple diet is mice, and that can get kind of monotonous, especially in a county of such rich, sustainable culinary pleasures. Which brings us to the likeliest scenario to explain what the heck those coyotes are doing up there on Highway 1 attacking cars. Camilla Fox, who founded the organization Project Coyote (projectcoyote.org) is responsible for signs that pop up around West Marin trailheads that say: “A fed coyote is a dead coyote.” The message is: Don’t feed the freaking coyotes. “If there are bad apples out there who are feeding the coyotes, they need to stop,” says Fox. “They can be cited—there’s a law that was specifically enacted to stop people from feeding wildlife.” “One possibility is that the coyote has been fed, and this is a real problem for us in Marin,” Bloch says. “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand.” Or, some dingbats might simply have thrown some baloney out the window in the direction of a coyote, who dutifully scarfed the meat and now wants more where that came from. Animals start acting super-aggressive, Bloch says, once the food-proffering hand has been introduced. So don’t do that, and instead understand that a fed coyote is a dead coyote. “What this means is that basically we want the animals to be afraid of us naturally,” Bloch says. “If they are not afraid of us, they come close to our cars, get hit, fight with domestic dogs and can possibly become aggressive.” The problem for coyotes is that if they turn aggressive, “the coyote is going to be blamed if a dog or, god forbid, a person is mauled.” The only recourse then is to kill the coyote. Bloch is a Tam Valley resident who says the neighbors can and should do a better job at keeping their property coyote-resistant, to limit such unwelcome outcomes. “It’s very frustrating to me—there are lots of coyotes all around, but people are leaving pet food out, small animals are roaming off leash, the cats are out. It’s an easy meal for a coyote.” The Humane Society is working the coyote-chase-car problem, Bloch says, and is asking for the public’s help—if anyone has seen the stare-down coyote near Slide Ranch, give them a holler. “We encourage people to report it right away if they see any kind of behaviors, any wildlife acting strangely, biting the tires of a car. We would go and check it out.” If the Humane Society locates the coyote or coyotes and discovers that they are injured in any way, its next stop would be at the animal rescue operation WildCare in San Rafael. But the Humane Society prefers any option that helps them save the animal while not trapping it—such as when a deer recently found itself in Bolinas Lagoon, like so many DUI drivers before it. “We pulled it out of the lagoon and once we determined the deer was OK, we led it to a quiet place so it could recover on its own.” That would be the preferred scenario for the coyote now menacing traffic on Highway 1. If the animal winds up at WildCare, “It’s not going back into nature,” Bloch says. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"A number of encounters in the San Francisco Bay Area of motorists reporting coyotes chasing passing cars, snapping at tires, and bringing traffic to a halt has raised the possibility that the coyotes may have ingested fly amanita mushrooms.

The first couple of years was the hardest.I was always stressed out about everything.Time was dragging by because I was always paying attention to it.While I was locked up,Tom who I talked to helped put this virtue in me.He told me that it was possible that he would never make it home but that being patient and believing that one day he would was what had made him feel better.After a while I realized why he said a lot of things to me.Once I stopped paying attention to the days and just kept in mind that I would get freedom,it seemed that my time passed quickly. Now I am home and can see that patience paid off for me. I now use this virtue in my daily activities. I know that sometimes life gets hard and that it will pay in the end to stay patient and not to get discouraged. So if you are having a hard time in life,be patient and it will eventually work out one way or another. Question: We can learn from the passage that the writer _ .

Tässä asiayhteydessä se voidaan kääntää suomeksi \\"Totuus vai Seuraukset\\". Lisäksi \\"Truth or Consequences\\" on myös kaupungin nimi New Mexicossa, Yhdysvalloissa. Kaupunki nimettiin alun perin Hot Springsiksi, mutta vuonna 1950 asukkaat päättivät muuttaa kaupungin nimeksi samannimisen suositun radio- ja televisio-ohjelman mukaan, jonka kehitti ja juonsi Ralph Edwards. On hyvä huomata, että vaikka suomennos \\"Totuus vai Seuraukset\\" on kielellisesti oikea käännös, se ei välttämättä ole yleisesti tunnettu nimi suomen kielessä.

Angela loved playing baseball on a team with all their friends but Christine did not because + Angela enjoyed sports. + Christine enjoyed sports.","response":"Angela loved playing baseball on a team with all their friends but Christine did not because their preferences and experiences when it came to sports diverged significantly, which took shape based on various factors that shaped their personal lives, social environments, upbringing, and intrinsic inclinations. To begin with, Angela enjoyed sports due to several reasons. Firstly, she might have grown up in a family that was deeply rooted in athletics and sports culture. Consequently, Angela might have inherited the love for sports through a strong influence from her family members who shared their passion with her. Furthermore, Angela could have been exposed to sports from an early age, which would have allowed her to develop the necessary skills, fitness levels, and emotional and psychological strength that are necessary to excel in sports. Through regular practice and dedication, Angela's love for sports grew and her athletic pursuits became an important aspect of her identity. Moreover, Angela could have derived a sense of camaraderie and belonging by participating in sports, especially team sports like baseball. Team sports often create a supportive environment through which individuals forge deep and long-lasting relationships with their peers. These connections not only help build emotional support systems, but also generate a sense of purpose, accomplishment, and motivation for continuous self-improvement. For Angela, playing on a team with her friends could have been a valuable source of joy, social engagement, and personal growth. On the other hand, Christine did not share the same passion for sports, including baseball. This might be attributed to various factors, such as a lack of exposure to sports during her childhood, or an innate disinterest that stemmed from her personality and preferences. Christine might have had other hobbies and interests that took precedence over sports, which contributed to shaping her personal growth and development in different spheres. Additionally, Christine's experience with sports could have been marred by negative events or discouraging situations, such as failed attempts, injuries, or personal conflicts with peers or coaches. Such experiences might have had a significant impact on her perception of sports and diminished any interest or enthusiasm she might have initially possessed. Alternatively, Christine might have been drawn to individual or non-competitive activities that allowed her to explore her creative, intellectual, or artistic inclinations. For instance, she could have been passionate about painting, writing, or engaging in other solitary pursuits that offered a stark contrast to the fast-paced and teamwork-oriented environment of organized sports. In conclusion, the reasons for Angela's love for sports and Christine's lack of interest therein can be traced back to the unique combination of personal factors, external influences, and inherent preferences that ultimately define their individual attitudes and approaches towards athletics. Angela's enjoyment of sports, especially playing baseball with her friends, might be attributed to her upbringing, early exposure to sports, or the emotional and social rewards of participating in team activities. Conversely, Christine's disinterest in sports might stem from a divergent set of priorities, negative experiences, or a personal inclination towards other hobbies and pursuits that resonate more with her personality and sensibilities."},{"question":"Leavitt Peak is located in the Emigrant Wilderness near Sonora Pass in the eastern Sierra Nevada range of California.

His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed.

Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September...

Little did they know that they were about to witness an extraordinary act of camaraderie and sportsmanship, as runner Matthew Rees stopped just short of the finish line to help a fellow competitor in need. As the 26.2-mile race drew to a close, Rees, a member of the Swansea Harriers running club, spotted his fellow runner struggling to continue just a few hundred meters from the finish line. Realizing that the fellow marathoner was in distress, Rees made the selfless decision to sacrifice his own race time in order to help the ailing runner. Ignoring the physical and mental exhaustion from running for hours, Rees slowed down and went over to the struggling competitor, whose legs were buckling beneath him. With arm over his shoulder, Rees valiantly supported the exhausted runner, helping him to continue forward toward the finish line. In an exceptional display of team spirit and empathy, Rees guided and encouraged his impromptu teammate every step of the way. As they inched closer to the finish line, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause, touched by the genuine compassion and selflessness that they were witnessing. Rees was not focused on his personal achievement; instead, he prioritized the well-being and success of a fellow athlete, who happened to be a complete stranger. The inspiring scene was captured on camera and quickly went viral on social media. Countless people across the globe were moved by Rees’ kindness and sportsmanship, proving that in today's fast-paced and competitive world, emphatic acts like these are valued and cherished. In a post-race interview, Rees humbly downplayed his actions, saying that he simply wanted to ensure that his fellow competitor was able to finish the race safely. His magnanimity and humility further endeared him to the hearts of people worldwide. The storyline of the 2017 London Marathon will forever be remembered for the remarkable sportsmanship and humanity displayed by Matthew Rees. His act of kindness transcended the boundaries of competition and exemplified the true spirit of marathon running – one of solidarity, perseverance, and unity. Rees’ decision to help a struggling competitor poignantly echoes the words of legendary British marathoner Richard Nerurkar: “A marathon is a shared experience, and the camaraderie that develops between runners who face the same challenge is incredibly strong.” Indeed, Rees became a shining example of the sportsmanship, selflessness, and compassion that prevail across the running community. As the world continues to grapple with division and strife in various arenas, the iconic image of Rees helping a fellow runner across the finish line serves as a powerful reminder of the unity and empathy that can exist within us all if we choose to embrace it. As we strive to create a kinder, more compassionate world, we can look to the example set by Matthew Rees, who in his moment of choice on a sunny Sunday in London, opted to uplift and support a fellow human in need."},{"question":"Având în vedere criza financiară şi economică, preşedinţia cehă a UE a declarat că se va axa pe trei aspecte importante – recuperarea pieţelor financiare, redresarea declinului economic şi coordonarea poziţiei UE pentru dezbaterile internaţionale asupra arhitecturii financiare globale, mai ales cele ce se vor ţine la summitul G20 de la Londra, în aprilie.

Answer: The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short- wavelength (high-frequency) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom . Question: What generates gamma radiation","response":"Gamma radiation, also known as gamma rays, is a type of high-energy electromagnetic radiation that originates from various natural and artificial sources. These photons have the shortest wavelength and highest frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum. The generation of gamma rays can be attributed to several processes both at the atomic and cosmic levels. Some of the primary sources of gamma radiation include radioactive decay, particle interactions, and astronomical phenomena. Here is a detailed explanation of these sources: 1. Radioactive Decay: Gamma radiation is commonly produced during the decay of unstable atomic nuclei through a process known as gamma decay. When an atom has excess energy, its nucleus can transition to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray. This process helps the nucleus return to a more stable state. Gamma decay often accompanies other types of radioactive decay, such as alpha and beta decay. 2. Particle Interactions: Gamma rays can also be generated from particle interactions within high-energy systems. One such example is the interaction between high-speed electrons and atomic nuclei during a process called bremsstrahlung (German for \\"braking radiation\\"). As an electron approaches a nucleus, it is deflected by the electrostatic force and loses kinetic energy. This energy is emitted in the form of a gamma photon. Another example is the annihilation of an electron and a positron (its antiparticle), which results in the production of two gamma photons. Additionally, gamma rays can be produced during high-energy nuclear reactions, such as in fusion or fission processes. 3. Astronomical Phenomena: Many cosmic processes generate gamma rays, which can be observed using specialized astronomical instruments. Some examples include: a) Supernovae: When a massive star reaches the end of its life cycle and explodes in a supernova, immense amounts of energy, including gamma rays, are released into the surrounding space. b) Pulsars: These highly-magnetized, rotating neutron stars emit powerful beams of electromagnetic radiation, which can include gamma rays. c) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): The supermassive black holes at the centers of some galaxies accrete surrounding matter, creating a disk of accelerated particles. This process releases high-energy radiation, including gamma rays. d) Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): These bright, short-lived events are among the most energetic explosions in the universe and are believed to result from the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. GRBs emit a majority of their energy in the form of gamma rays. 4. Artificial Sources: Humans can artificially generate gamma rays in various ways, such as through nuclear reactions in reactors, particle accelerators, and weapons. Medical equipment, such as PET scanners, also use artificially-created gamma rays for imaging purposes. In conclusion, gamma radiation is generated by many processes, from the decay of radioactive materials to high-energy astronomical events. These powerful photons provide valuable insight into the atomic and cosmic realms and play a crucial role in our understanding of the universe."},{"question":"Question: What is the final step of the following process: - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck Answer:","response":"The final step of the described coal mining process is the transportation of the coal to its final destination or designated facility. After the coal is loaded onto the truck, it will be transported to either a coal-fired power plant, a coal processing plant, or a coal distribution center, where it can be further processed, stored, or distributed to various industries for utilization in energy production, steel manufacturing, or other industrial applications.

After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F. Given a person is recovering from a fever, will their body temperature be increasing or decreasing? Hint: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. Answer:","response":"Given that a person is recovering from a fever, their body temperature will be decreasing. In the case of James, his body temperature is currently 100.6°F, which is higher than the normal body temperature of 98.6°F. This elevated temperature is a result of his body's immune response, specifically from the white blood cells, to fight off the bacterial infection causing his strep throat. As the body fights off the infection, the pathogens reproduce more slowly due to the raised temperature, and the immune system produces more white blood cells. Once the infection is under control or eliminated, the body will no longer need this elevated temperature. Consequently, the body temperature will decrease back to its normal range, indicating that recovery from the fever is taking place."},{"question":"A 37-year-old Bronx woman accused of a charity scam after the Connecticut school mass shooting was indicted Tuesday on a charge of making false statements to the FBI, prosecutors said.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that there will be less sunny days, which implies less sunlight will be available for the plant's photosynthesis process. Step 2: Determine the effect of less sunlight on the photosynthesis process Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant capture sunlight as an energy source to carry out photosynthesis. If there is less sunlight, the plant's ability to perform photosynthesis may be limited or hindered. Step 3: Assess the impact of limited photosynthesis on sugar and oxygen production The photosynthesis process requires light, water, minerals, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen. If the process is hindered due to less sunlight, the production of both sugar and oxygen will likely decrease. Step 4: Establish the direct and indirect effects of the perturbation on the process The direct effect of the perturbation on the process is the reduced capacity for chloroplasts to capture light from the sun. This directly impacts the plant's ability to perform photosynthesis. The indirect effect of the perturbation is that the scarcity of sunlight will lead to a decreased production of sugar and oxygen. Since glucose serves as a source of energy for the plant, reduced glucose production may impact the plant's growth, health, and reproduction. Furthermore, lowered oxygen production may have implications for the surrounding environment and organisms that rely on plant-sourced oxygen. Conclusion: The perturbation hypothesis does indeed have an effect on the process of photosynthesis in a plant. Less sunny days will result in a reduced ability for chloroplasts to capture sunlight, which in turn impacts the production of sugar and oxygen by the plant. These changes have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

First you'll need to consider the type of site you are aiming to build. This will determine the type of coding you have to use; for example, flash visual-heavy sites tend to emphasize JavaScript, whereas a script-based site might utilize HTML. Some common web design languages include HTML and CSS, Java, and Python. HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) tend to go hand-in-hand: HTML is responsible for creating the core structure of any basic webpage, while CSS dictates aspects of the webpage like theme, color, and layout. Both are fairly basic programs, and thus are recommended for beginners. Python and Java are higher-level codes used by advanced programmers to create dynamic sites. Both are well-suited to high-traffic sites such as Amazon or Yahoo Maps. There are a ton of sites that will teach you entry-level coding for free. GitHub, CodeAcademy, Khan Academy, and Code Avengers all offer unique and interactive ways to learn HTML and CSS webpage coding. These resources are all easily accessed, and should be more than sufficient for most webpage coding needs. If you're interested in more advanced coding literature, MIT Open Courseware, edX, and Google University Consortium both offer free courses in Java and Python. Focus on learning your language of choice and make it a priority, but don't expect to learn an entire language overnight--this will take time! While knowing how to code basic webpages and templates is the end goal, keep in mind the fact that webpage coding is a marketable skill; thus, you should absolutely consider branching out into more advanced territory as you learn.

The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.

English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The isotope is more unstable happens, how will it affect MORE radioactive decay occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process. Step-by-step analysis: 1. An isotope has too many protons: In this case, since the isotope is more unstable, it indicates that there is higher proton-to-neutron ratio leading to increased instability. 2. The isotope is unstable: Due to this increased instability, the isotope will be more prone to decay. 3. The isotope emits radiation: As the isotope is more unstable, it will emit radiation to reach a more stable state. The rate of radiation emitted will potentially be higher compared to a less unstable isotope. 4. The isotope decays: As a result of emitting radiation, the isotope will undergo decay. The more unstable the isotope, the faster the decay will likely occur. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: During the decay process, atomic particles like protons or neutrons are expelled from the nucleus. Since the isotope started with too many protons and it is more unstable, it may lose more atomic particles in the process. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: After losing the atomic particles, the isotope's atomic makeup changes, leading to the formation of a different element. In this scenario, where the isotope is more unstable, it could potentially result in a greater variety of decay products. 7. The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation: At this point, the isotope has reached a more stable state, and radiation emission slows down. However, the increased instability of the initial isotope may have led to a faster decay process and a greater amount of radiation emitted over time. In conclusion, the perturbation of the isotope being more unstable directly affects the process by increasing the rate of decay and causing the isotope to emit more radiation in order to reach stability."},{"question":"Вы можете отправить нам запрос по электронной почте с помощью следующей формы.

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What happened to the narrator after the article? Options: A. Their website made them a target. B. Their website got a lot of traffic. C. Their website was a success.

Gerry and Joe leave the injured man a blanket, a canteen and a gun before driving off, supposedly to seek medical aid.

Carson is reported missing to police lieutenant Mike Platt and to Dave Emory, who is Carson's lawyer and business manager. Gerry doesn't mention the broken leg and claims her husband wandered off.

It took place on the third anniversary of the 2014 coup which brought the military government to power.

Thai newspaper The Nation said Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had ordered an immediate investigation into the attack at the hospital, which also treats civilians. Three years after the armed forces seized power in Thailand, they rule almost unchallenged; the few who have dared oppose the government openly have been detained and charged. But there have been occasional small bombs, presumed to be in protest against the military. One went off last week close to the royal palace, where preparations are still under way for the elaborate cremation of the late King Bhumibol, who died last October. The military has succeeded in maintaining order and stability through a sensitive royal succession; but it has done little to address the political divisions underlying the conflicts which preceded the coup. Three years ago to the day the military ousted an elected government following months of street protests.

It was released on record label Universal Music Australia on 21 August 2000 as the first single from the band's fourth album, Odyssey Number Five. The single is Powderfinger's most successful; it peaked at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart--the first Powderfinger song to do so. Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning wrote the lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" as a reflection on the time the band spent touring to promote their work, and the loneliness that came as a result. If you can't cop a bit of emotional stuff then you should go and get the lamp shade extracted from your arse. If you don't think there is enough rock in your life then let me know and I will personally come around to your house and chuck stones at you. --Bernard FanningIn response to \\"My Happiness\\" being described by fans as \\"like Lauryn Hill, bland and boring Top 40 bullshit\\". The lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" were written by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for composing the track. The song describes feelings of love and separation; Sain's Pennie Dennison said it described \\"the pining feeling you experience when you spend time away from the one you love\\". Fanning called it \\"a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it\\". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on the back of this that Fanning wrote \\"My Happiness\\". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song. \\"My Happiness\\" was attacked by some fans as being \\"like Lauryn Hill, bland and boring Top 40 bullshit\\"; guitarist Ian Haug rebutted by pointing out that the song was an example of the new emotional level on which Powderfinger made music, while Fanning was more aggressive in his defence of the song. In response to being dubbed \\"Mr Miserable\\" by The Sun-Herald's Peter Holmes for the lyrics of \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"These Days\\", Fanning pointed out that the songs could be construed either as melancholy, or as part of \\"the most hopeful record ... in a long time\\". Much of Fanning's writing is inspired by non-rock music, and \\"My Happiness\\" is no exception. Gospel and soul music that is \\"unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel\\" was common during the Odyssey Number Five recording sessions. Powderfinger worked hard in those sessions to ensure a more polished work than Internationalist; guitarist Darren Middleton concluded that \\"My Happiness\\", \\"The Metre\\", and \\"Up & Down & Back Again\\" were more \\"complete\\" because of the band's efforts. The lighter elements of \\"My Happiness\\" in comparison to some of the band's earlier work saw Fanning reveal his passion for several other musicians, such as James Taylor--something that \\"five years ago ... would have been an embarrassing thing to say\\". Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was the arrangement unusual?","response":"The article doesn't specifically mention if the arrangement of \\"My Happiness\\" was unusual. However, it does mention that the song has lighter elements compared to some of the band's earlier work and was inspired by gospel and soul music that is \\"unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel.\\""},{"question":"This article: Susan Miller works as a girdle salesgirl in a big department store.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Four of the blasts occurred in the Shiite heartland in the southern region of Iraq. Two car bombs exploded near a busy outdoor market in Amara, killing 13 people and wounding 24 others. A bomb went off near an outdoor market in Diwaniya, killing six people and wounding 20 others. And two people died and 11 others were wounded in a bombing at a commercial area in Karbala. Another blast occurred in Mahmoudiya, a predominantly Sunni area just south of Baghdad. Four people were killed and 14 others were wounded in that attack. Iraq pulls plug on 'misleading' TV networks. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, nor was it clear whether they were related. But the fighting has prompted fears among Iraqi leaders and international powers that the tensions between Sunnis and Shiites could escalate and bring a return of the full-blown sectarian war that raged last decade. Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government last decade, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. There have been protests for months by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. The anger has escalated since a confrontation last week between police and protesters in Hawija. The International Crisis Group last week said that the \\"failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a genuinely representative political system in Baghdad risks turning Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle.\\" \\"The most urgent task today is to tamp down the flames, and the burden for this lies above all with the government,\\" the Belgium-based think tank said in a report. \\"The country is at a crossroads,\\" said Martin Kobler, U.N. special representative in Iraq. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"This article highlights the ongoing sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, which resulted in series of car bombings that killed 25 people and wounded dozens more. These attacks have raised concerns among Iraqi leaders and international powers, fearing a return to a full-blown sectarian war as seen in the previous decade. The article also mentions that since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized, while Shiites have gained more power. This has led to growing resentment and protests by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. Furthermore, the International Crisis Group warns that the failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a representative political system might turn Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle. The think tank states that the most urgent task is to control the situation, with the burden of responsibility falling on the government. Lastly, the UN special representative in Iraq, Martin Kobler, declares that the country is at a crossroads, signifying the critical nature of the current situation and the need to address the underlying issues."},{"question":"Bushka zbledl hněvem, ale zůstal zticha. Which language is this?","response":"This sentence is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian, and it uses the Latin alphabet with additional diacritics for pronunciation. The sentence you provided translates to: \\"Bushka turned pale with anger, but remained silent.\\" Czech is known for its complex grammar system, including complicated consonant clusters and a rich case system. The language is characterized by its relatively free word order, which is influenced by an extensive system of inflection. There are seven cases in Czech, reflecting different syntactic roles of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives within a sentence: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Czech vocabulary is derived mainly from the common Slavic language, which existed around the 6th and 7th centuries AD. But it has also borrowed words from other languages such as Latin, German, and English. The Czech language has not only played an important role in the cultural life of the Czech Republic, but it also has considerable influence in other Slavic countries as well. The works of the Czech historical figures like religious reformer Jan Hus, the educator and philosopher Jan Amos Komenský (known as Comenius in English), as well as the contributions of Nobel Prize-winning Czech authors such as Jaroslav Seifert and Bohumil Hrabal, have all added to the language’s rich history and global presence."},{"question":"Q: In this task you are given a sentence.

Whilst the first film was campy and creepy. The second one was sleazy and cheesy. The production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious. The brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis'. The \\"scene\\" from the first film was badly re-created. A skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to uncover the mystery to her sister's murder/transformation/death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two. Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear as Stirba, the head werewolf of the Romania. She also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww! Bad movie. There's nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprise Philippe Mora directed this picture because he's usually a good film-maker.

Your task is to summarize them. \\"My family had to leave Libya just to survive,\\" says a young bearded man in spectacles, perching awkwardly on a white leather sofa. We are in the front room of Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi's mansion in Hampstead Garden Suburb, recently expropriated by activists working in alliance with Libyan exiles. An hour earlier, I had passed through an open window near some ugly imported ferns belonging to Muammar al-Gaddafi's son, having been invited to meet the members of the new Free Libyan Embassy. We drink stewed tea from Saif's best china and eat cheese sandwiches using his silver cutlery, while the young man, Abdulla, tells me about how his uncle was \\"disappeared\\" by Saif's father. \\"In Libya, people disappear all the time. There was a prison massacre where 1,200 people died. They poured cement over the bodies.\\" Abdulla nervously adjusts his glasses. \\"It's important that people know we're not creating a civil war for no reason.\\" Nearly every room in this enormous house boasts a large, flat-screen television. The occupiers have set each one to al-Jazeera, for rolling coverage of the people's revolutions that are sweeping the Arab world. Televised gunfire echoes in the marble hallway as Jay, 25, explains how activists from the London squatter movement took over the Gaddafi mansion, moving in secretly and putting up notices declaring their intention to hold the empty house under English common law. \\"We wanted to show our solidarity the best way we know how,\\" he says. “It's a symbolic and practical reclamation of private property that belongs to the Libyan people. It's about their struggle, which is why the place has been handed over to the Libyans as a place to organise and a safe space for refugees,\\" Jay says. \\"People have been arriving in support from all over the UK.\\" The tabloids have portrayed the occupiers as drunken anarchists but this is, in Jay's words, \\"total bollocks\\". \\"On the first night, people came down thinking there would be a squat party and we turned them away. They didn't seem to realise how seriously we're taking this,\\" he explains. “At first, we were elated that we'd managed to pull it off. Then the Libyans turned up and they were elated. But once they started to get reports about family and friends being killed, the atmosphere changed. We were watching Zawiyah burning on al-Jazeera and someone saw his own house. It was terrible.\\" Jay takes me on a tour over four floors of hushed opulence, each several times the size of an ordinary London flat. \\"It's worth nearly £11m,\\" he says. Under the kitchen is a cosy entertainment complex, complete with pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and a private cinema done out in suede, the pews so thick and warm you could sleep on them – which people have been doing. On the corner of one aisle a bare duvet lies, neatly folded. Everything here is white, bright and glistening: white leather sofas, marble floors, silver candlesticks adorning pristine white walls. The only note of colour is in one of the guest bedrooms, where a Libyan flag has been draped over the TV. Fuelling anger Fearing the spectacle of bailiffs dragging Libyans out of the private property of a Gaddafi, at a time when the UK government is desperately downplaying its erstwhile support for the dictator, the authorities have kept their distance. But that doesn't mean that there have been no attempts to get the occupiers to leave. “Last night, at about four in the morning, someone came to the door,\\" Jay says. According to Abdulla, \\"It was a well-dressed Arab person, [wearing] nice clothes and gold. When I asked him what he was doing here so late, he said, 'I want to make you an offer.' He told us: 'I have £40,000 in cash. You can have it if you leave immediately.' No amount of money could make us leave this house. It's not a financial issue.\\" On the sofa opposite, a quiet man called Ambarak suddenly speaks up in Arabic. \\"What's a life worth?\\" he says, as Abdulla translates softly. \\"What are 100,000 lives worth?\\" Ambarak perches on the edge of the sofa, looking out of place in his keffiyeh and scuffed trainers. \\"I'm talking about people being shot by snipers in the street. I'm talking about family members selling dry bread to live. “They ask what the west should do, but they've known about [Muammar] Gaddafi for years,\\" he continues in broken English. \\"They did nothing. The petrol . . .\\" – he rubs his fingers together in a \\"money\\" gesture, grinning without humour. \\"My brother has disappeared in the fighting. We haven't heard from him, we have no way of contacting him.\\" Ambarak goes very quiet. \\"Excuse me, please. I must go and pray.\\" \\"The resources that come out of Libya should belong to the people but that petrol money goes somewhere else,\\" says Abdulla. \\"All those close to Gaddafi have places like this to live. There are some who are heartless and will do anything for a comfortable life.\\" Ambarak's family is in Misurata, where fierce fighting continues. \\"They say on the phone that they can hear shooting and tanks are coming down the street. My cousin has died, [as have] my friend, my neighbours.\\" An influx of neighbours bearing food terminates the interview. A young man wearing a Libyan flag like a cape takes the cups politely to the sink. He is a long way from home. \\"We all want to go home,\\" says Abdulla. \\"But not to Libya as it is now.\\" The Libyans involved in this article wanted their names to be known; other names have been changed.

Unskilled workers may choose to retire early.; B). more people have to receive in-service training.; C). Even wealthy people must work longer to live comfortably in retirement.; D). People may be able to enjoy generous defined-benefits from pension plans.; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the less-skilled. Some 65% of American men aged 62-74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with 32% of men with only a high-school certificate. This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-education well off and the unskilled poor. Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. The consequences, for individual and society, are profound. The world is facing as astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before. Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1.1 billion. The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems. But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled. Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer. The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce. That even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role. Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation. Technological change may well reinforce that shift: the skills that complement computers, from management knowhow to creativity. Do not necessarily decline with age. Question: What is the result of policy changes in European countries? Answer: A:","response":"The article does not provide information about the result of policy changes in European countries. However, it does discuss the growing gap between skilled and unskilled workers and its consequences on employment rates, retirement, and economic growth."},{"question":"In this task, you need to count the number of times the given letter appears in the given sentence.

Answer:","response":"The best answer for the given question \\"A flashlight does this.\\" is \\"light.\\" A flashlight is a portable handheld device that is primarily designed to emit light when needed. The main function of a flashlight is to provide light in darkness or to illuminate areas that are not well-lit. It works by converting chemical energy stored in batteries into electrical energy, which powers the light-emitting diode (LED) or incandescent light bulb to produce light. The other answer choices provided do not accurately describe the primary function of a flashlight. Here's a brief explanation of why each of them is not suitable: - Absorbs light: A flashlight does not absorb light; it emits light. - Career: A flashlight is not a career; it is an object without any connection to a profession. - Employment: Similar to career, employment has no relation to a flashlight as it pertains to a job or a profession. - Work: Although a flashlight does convert energy, the specific answer \\"work\\" is too vague and does not directly relate to the primary function of a flashlight, which is to provide light. - Small: This term relates to the size and not the function of a flashlight; some flashlights may be small, while others can be larger. - Lenses: While some flashlights may have lenses to focus or disperse light, lenses themselves describe a part of the flashlight and not its overall function. - Warmth: A flashlight's primary function is to emit light, not to provide warmth.

There are over 600 known species of Oak, with 55 found in the continental United States. Because there is such a wide variety of oak trees in the world, it can be hard to find characteristics that unite them all. However, they do exist: Acorns are the easiest way to spot an oak tree. If the tree produces acorns, it's an oak. Lobed leaves are leaves that have rounded or pointed knobs extending out from the center line. While a few oaks do not have lobes, all of the leaves are generally symmetrical around a clear median line. Small, scaly bark. Bark on oak trees is variable, but it is generally made up of small, hard, and scaly bits of bark. This is unlike the large, flaky chunks of pines or the wallpaper-like bark on birch trees, and is much more cracked and grooved. Lobes are the bits of leaf that extend out to each side from the center of the leaf, like points on a star. White oaks have rounded lobes while red oaks have pointed ones. This is an important distinction that will cut the number of potential trees you're trying to identify in half. On red oaks, the vein of the leave extends all the way out to the edge, creating this point. Each area has its own assortment of oak species, which is often drastically different from other areas. The species of oak you will encounter changes great depending on where you are in the world, as it is rare for an oak found on the east coast to be found in the west, a southern oak in the north, etc. You can generally figure out your region with a few criteria (examples here are for Continental US): General location -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, Southwest Inland or coastal. Mountainous or flat terrain. The lobes are the sections that extend out from the center of the leaf's stem on both sides. If possible, compare multiple leaves to find the average number of lobes. A few species such as the willow oak have no lobes at all, but most oaks have multiple lobes. Count at least 4-5 leaves when identifying, as this will help when you turn to the field guide. Look at the area between the lobes and determine whether the indentations are deep or shallow. White oak leaves often have variable indentations that alternate randomly between shallow and deep, where red oaks can have dramatic, sharp indentations or none at all. The leaves of evergreen oaks are shiny and dark green all year, but most oaks will turn colors in autumn. Some oaks, such as scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), sport brilliant colors in the fall. White oaks and chestnut oaks are often a dull brown when color comes around. If it's summer, look at whether the leaves are dark green or light green, and whether they're shiny or not, to help determine the species. Evergreen oaks and a couple red oaks such as scrub oak have smaller leaves while most red oaks and nearly all deciduous white oaks have much larger leaves (at least 4 in.). This is one of the more important distinguishing features between similar species of oak. Using the data you've collected, identify your oak tree using a tree manual or field guide. There are dozens and dozens of oak trees out there, and you can't he expected to know them all by heart. Use the above criteria to narrow down your choices, then use the guide to find what oak you're looking at. You can look through the collection of common oak trees below, or consult a Field Guide, found through the US Forestry Service. Turn to the appropriate section. Most guides are divided into a red oak section and a white oak section Narrow your selection down to the oaks specific to your area. A good guide should have distribution maps for each species. Once you have a list of possibilities, look at the pictures for each one to determine your tree. Summary:","response":"Oak trees are special types of trees found in many places around the world. There are lots of different kinds of oak trees, but they all share some things in common. They make acorns, which are little nuts that fall from the tree. Oak leaves have special shapes called lobes that stick out from the middle of the leaf. Oak tree bark is usually rough and scaly. There are two main groups of oak trees: white oaks and red oaks. White oaks have rounded lobes on their leaves, while red oaks have pointy ones. To identify an oak tree, look at its leaves, bark, location, and the shape and color of its leaves. Use a tree guide or manual to help you figure out what kind of oak tree you are looking at."},{"question":"Definition: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed.

She went online and researched walking for exercise. She spoke with a trainer at the YMCA who helped her write a plan. Mary started out walking one block per day, for one week. By the end of the month, she was walking four blocks. Can we draw the following conclusion? Mary wanted to lose weight","response":"Based on the information provided, we can infer that Mary was interested in embarking on a walking plan, likely for health or fitness purposes. Multiple reasons could have contributed to her decision to implement a walking routine, and it's important to consider all possibilities when drawing conclusions. We know that Mary researched walking for exercise online and sought professional advice from a trainer at a local YMCA. This indicates that she was serious about incorporating walking into her daily routine and looking for ways to do so safely and effectively. Her progressive walking plan from one to four blocks over the course of a month displays her commitment to improving her fitness levels. While it's possible that weight loss was a motivating factor for Mary, there could be other reasons for her to adopt a walking plan. Walking can help improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, alleviate stress and anxiety, and lead to an overall healthier lifestyle. Mary might have been interested in any or all of these potential benefits, not just weight loss. Furthermore, walking is a low-impact exercise, making it accessible and gentle on the joints for individuals with a wide variety of fitness levels. It's possible that Mary was drawn to walking as a simple and affordable way to improve her overall health and well-being, regardless of whether or not she consciously wanted to lose weight. To summarize, it is not appropriate to definitively conclude that Mary wanted to lose weight based solely on the information provided. She was focused on incorporating walking as an exercise into her lifestyle, but we cannot pinpoint her exact motivations without more context. Instead, we can infer that she was committed to improving her overall health and fitness levels by implementing a progressive walking plan."},{"question":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Until the mid 1980s this was only practical with the brush-type DC motor, although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion. Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century, most early electrified railways used DC and many still do, particularly rapid transit (subways) and trams. Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations, by varying the traction motors' fields, and by inserting and removing starting resistances to limit motor current. Q: What is speed limit for railways?","response":"The speed limit for railways varies depending on the type of train, track conditions, and the country or region where the railway is located. Generally, speed limits for trains are imposed to ensure safety, efficiency, and the operational performance of the railway systems. Here, we will take a look at different types of train systems and some examples of their speed limits: 1. Conventional passenger trains: Conventional trains, also known as non-high-speed trains, usually operate at speeds between 70 km/h (45 mph) and 160 km/h (100 mph). For instance, in the United States, the speed limit for conventional passenger trains is typically around 120 km/h (75 mph). However, some regions, such as Europe, have introduced higher speed limits ranging from 160 km/h (100 mph) to 200 km/h (124 mph) on specific routes. 2. Freight trains: Freight trains usually have lower speed limits than passenger trains because of their heavier loads and the need for braking distance. In general, freight trains in the United States can operate at maximum speeds of 80 km/h (50 mph) to 112 km/h (70 mph). In Europe, the average speed limit for freight trains is about 100 km/h (62 mph). 3. High-speed rail: High-speed rail systems operate at significantly higher speeds than conventional trains, ranging from 200 km/h (124 mph) to 350 km/h (217 mph) or even higher. For example, the Japanese Shinkansen operates at speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph); the French TGV achieves speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph) or 350 km/h (217 mph) on some lines; and the Chinese CRH trains can reach up to 350 km/h (217 mph) on their dedicated high-speed lines. Speed limits on high-speed rail tracks are determined by factors such as the quality and maintenance of the track, signaling systems, and train design and capabilities. 4. Urban rapid transit and trams: Urban rapid transit systems like subways, light rail, and trams usually have lower speed limits than intercity trains. For instance, speed limits on many subway systems typically range from 50 km/h (31 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph), while for light rail or trams, the limits may vary from 30 km/h (19 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph), depending on the type of track and the environment they operate in. Ultimately, the speed limit for railways depends on a multitude of factors, such as train design, track conditions, signaling systems, and regional regulations, all of which influence the safe and efficient operation of railway networks."},{"question":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","response":"Sentence: The dog jumped over the fence to chase the butterfly. Explanation: 1. Dog: A dog is a friendly four-legged animal that people often keep as pets. They bark and wag their tails when they're happy. 2. Jumped: Jumping is when your body, or in this case, the dog's body, leaves the ground for a moment by pushing off with your legs. It's like hopping or leaping into the air. 3. Over: Over means going above something else. In this case, it means the dog went above the fence when jumping. 4. Fence: A fence is a structure made of wood, metal, or other materials that is used to divide or enclose an area, like a yard or garden. Imagine it like a wall around your house but shorter and with gaps in between its parts. 5. Chase: Chasing is running or moving quickly after someone or something to try to catch them. In this case, the dog is chasing the butterfly to try to be close to it. 6. Butterfly: A butterfly is a small, beautiful insect with two large, colorful wings. They fly from flower to flower to drink nectar, and people often find them interesting and fun to watch."},{"question":"I'll give you a question, please answer with step-by-step reasoning process. God didn't kill off everyone in the flood, so what does that suggest he has? Options: - everything - imagination - compassion - strength - heaven","response":"To answer this question, let's analyze the options step-by-step in relation to the given context: 1. God didn't kill off everyone in the flood, which implies that some people survived. This could suggest that God made a decision to spare certain individuals. 2. Analyzing the options: a. Everything: This option does not relate to the context of the question. It is more of a general concept about God. b. Imagination: This option also doesn't seem relevant to the context of the question. Imagination is typically associated with the ability to come up with new ideas or concepts, rather than the decision to spare or not spare individuals in a particular situation c. Compassion: This option relates to the ability to empathize with others and show concern for their well-being. If God spared some individuals during the flood, it is quite possible that God has compassion for those individuals. d. Strength: This option is more about God's power in general, but it doesn't necessarily point to a specific reason for sparing some individuals in the flood. e. Heaven: This option is another general concept about God and does not specifically address the question.

Today, I want to tell you something about a very good golfer named Mickelson. He plays a game called golf, where he hits a small ball with a stick, called a club, into a small hole very far away. Well, something surprising is happening! This year, Mickelson won't be playing in a big golf event called the FedEx Cup play-offs finale. This is the first time in his whole career that he won't be playing in this big event! Mickelson didn't do so well in a recent golf game, where he scored six-over-par 76. In golf, a lower number is better. This score left him in the seventh to last place among 68 players. It's like when we play a game, and sometimes we don't win, right?

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","response":"This data provides in-depth information about 10 Hygiea, an object in our solar system, as observed at a specific time frame known as an epoch, in this case, the date being June 27, 2015. Hygiea, or more formally known as 10 Hygiea due to its status as the tenth minor planet in the Solar System to be discovered, is the fourth-largest asteroid in the Asteroid Belt and a potentially fascinating subject of astronomical study. In regards to its movement around the sun, 10 Hygiea has an orbital period of 5.57 days. The orbital period is essentially the time that it takes for any celestial body, such as planets, asteroids, or comets, to complete one full orbit around its primary star, which in Hygiea's case is the Sun. An orbital period of 5.57 days means that 10 Hygiea completes one full orbit around the Sun in that time frame. The data also provides information about the escape velocity of 10 Hygiea, which stands at 0.21 kilometres per second. The escape velocity is basically the minimum velocity an object must have in order to escape the gravitational influence of a particular planet or other body. In simpler terms, if a rocket or any other object were to leave 10 Hygiea and to not fall back, it would need to travel at least at a speed of 0.21 kilometres per second. 10 Hygiea has a surface area of 837,080.744 square kilometres, akin to the surface area of a country on Earth, making it one of the larger bodies in the asteroid belt. The term 'apoapsis' refers to the point of greatest distance from the center of a celestial body's orbit around its orbiting body. For 10 Hygiea, the apoapsis is approximately 523,951,582.33968 kilometres. This means that at its farthest orbital point, 10 Hygiea is over half a billion kilometres away from the Sun. In summary, the provided data is a detailed astronomical profile of the asteroid 10 Hygiea, giving precise figures on its orbital period, escape velocity, surface area, and apoapsis. This information can be crucial to astronomers and scientists studying the properties and behaviour of different celestial bodies in our solar system. It helps in understanding not only the specific characteristics and conditions of 10 Hygiea itself, but also provides wider insights about the asteroid belt and our solar system's dynamics as a whole."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): Herbert Bareuther (29 July 1914 – 30 April 1945) was a World War II fighter ace from Nazi Germany.

One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits.

The band's original members consisted of vocalist Tom Meighan, guitarist and vocalist Sergio Pizzorno, guitarist Chris Karloff, and bassist Chris Edwards. The band's line-up was completed by drummer Ian Matthews in 2004 after a string of session drummers. Karloff left the band in 2006 and founded a new band called Black Onassis. In 2016, the band played a short tour in May, culminating in two concerts at Leicester City Football Club's ground, the King Power Stadium, to celebrate them winning the Premier League. At the first of these two concerts, Kasabian debuted a new song, \\"Put Your Life On It\\", dedicated to the city and those who are no longer with us to see the cities recent sporting achievements, accompanied by a gospel choir from De Montfort University. They also performed a short set in Leicester's Victoria Park, as part of the LCFC victory parade on 16 May. Numerous inspirations for the sixth album also have been listed, including Nirvana, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie and Claudio Ranieri. On 8 September, it was confirmed that \\"Comeback Kid\\" will be featured on the soundtrack of EA Sports game FIFA 17. In December 2016 the group were rumoured to play Reading & Leeds Festival the following year, but insisted that, \\"The band are currently finishing their new album\\". The band have been announced for several festivals in summer 2017, including a slot at Reading & Leeds Festival in August. In January 2017, in an interview to NME Pizzorno revealed that the upcoming album would contain a track called \\"Bless This Acid House\\", which, in the musician's opinion, is one of the best songs he has written. In March 2017, it was confirmed that the band's sixth album would be titled For Crying Out Loud, and released in of that year.

Article: It can be hard to encourage families of preschoolers to turn off the TV,but there are plenty of highquality shows that promote learning and positive relationships rather than violence,researchers noted. \\"Although clearly kids watch too much,what's more worrying is that they watch poor quality shows,\\" said Dr Christakis,the lead researcher on the new study from the University of Washington in Seattle.His former survey of parents of threeto fiveyearold children showed the kids often watched violent cartoons and movies that are \\"totally inappropriate\\". For their study,he and his colleagues randomly divide 565 preschoolers into two groups.In one group,parents recorded notes about kids' normal TV viewing,without receiving any guidelines to reduce or change those habits.In the other group,researchers made visits and calls and sent monthly newsletters encouraging parents to replace violent TV with educational programming.After six and 12 months,parents reported their kid's angry,aggressive or anxious behaviors on a questionnaire.At both time points,children in the TV intervention program had slightly fewer problems than those in the comparison group.Boys in lowincome families seemed to benefit most from the change in programming,the researchers found. \\"The point is,this is something that is as effective as other things we do to try to guide behavior in children,and it's fairly simple,\\" Christakis said. Another study published in Pediatrics found the more TV kids and teens watched,the more likely they were to have a crime or other problems in society.Children may imitate violence they see--or more time in front of the TV could simply mean less communication with peers and families,and worse performance in school.

Its sample return capsule is scheduled to detach from its \\"mothership\\" and land at Woomera on 13 June, but there is no guarantee of mission success. It remains doubtful whether the probe managed to grab any material from Itokawa; scientists will have to open the capsule to find out. At the weekend, the Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) announced that Hayabusa had successfully completed its third Trajectory Correction Manoeuvre (TCM), designed to guide the spacecraft towards a touchdown in the Australian outback. The spacecraft now lies within about 3,600,000km of our planet. Just one further, more detailed, correction manouevre is planned for the spacecraft before its sample capsule is returned to Earth at around 1400 GMT on Sunday. The US space agency (Nasa) will deploy a DC-8 plane from California to observe the scheduled landing. The aircraft is packed with imaging and spectrographic cameras to capture different aspects of the craft's re-entry. Even if Hayabusa failed to grab large samples at Itokawa, scientists hope the capsule may still contain small residues from the asteroid that could be analysed in laboratories. Asteroids contain primordial material left over from the formation of the Solar System billions of years ago. The mission has been beset with problems. Hayabusa made two \\"touchdowns\\" on Itokawa designed to collect rocks and soil, but apparently failed to fire a metal bullet designed to gather the samples. A fuel leak in 2005 left Hayabusa's chemical propellant tanks empty, so engineers had to use the spacecraft's ion engines to guide the spacecraft home. Ion thrusters are highly efficient but have a low acceleration. This means that each trajectory correction takes much longer to complete than it would with chemical engines.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"Removing excess fat from baked potato wedges primarily deals with prevention. It's easier to reduce the amount of fat used in preparing potato wedges than it is to try and remove the fat after they've been cooked. Here are some steps you can follow to accomplish this. 1. Choose the Right Potato: The type of potato you choose can have a significant impact on the fat content of your wedges. Some potatoes, like russets, are naturally low in fat and high in fiber. They also have a nice, fluffy texture when baked. 2. Preparing the Potatoes: Soaking the potato wedges in cold water for an hour or so before baking can help reduce the amount of oil needed to bake them. The soaking process removes excess starch which results in a crispier wedge without the need for extra oil. 3. Reducing the Oil: One of the key reasons why potato wedges can be high in fat is because of the amount of oil used to bake them with. Instead of drowning your wedges in oil, try using an oil spray to lightly coat them, or lightly brush them with oil. Make sure every edge is marginally coated, this will provide you with crispy wedges without unnecessary oil. 4. Use Alternative Cooking Methods: Instead of baking, you can try air frying your wedges. Air fryers cook food by circulating hot air around it, so you'll need less oil to get the same crispy texture. 5. Roasting on A Rack: When baking, try putting your potato wedges on a wire rack on top of your baking tray. Any excess oil will drip down onto the tray, away from your wedges. 6. Make Use of Spices: Enhance the flavor of your potato wedges by using a variety of spices instead of added oil or fats. Herbs like rosemary and thyme, or spices like chili powder and cumin, can boost the flavor of your wedges without any added fat. 7. Avoid Adding Extra Fat: Resist the urge to add extra fats like cheese or cream-based dips. If you're craving a dip, opt for lower-fat options like salsa or a homemade yoghurt-based dip. 8. Eat in Moderation: Ultimately, potato wedges can be a part of a healthy diet if eaten in moderation. This is particularly important if you're trying to cut back on your overall fat intake. On the other hand, if you're looking to remove oil from already baked potato wedges, options are limited. You can place the hot wedges on paper towels right after baking, which should soak up some of the oil. However, this method isn't perfect and a significant amount of oil will still be left in the wedges. That's why focusing on reducing the amount of fat in the preparation and cooking process is the best way to remove excess fat from baked potato wedges."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The San Pablo Reservoir is an open cut terminal water storage reservoir owned and operated by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD).

The paragraph talks about a place called San Pablo Reservoir, which is like a big water-storage area. It says it's north of Orinda and south of El Sobrante and Richmond. That means it's between those areas, like in the middle. Now, the hypothesis is like a guess, and it says that San Pablo Reservoir is underneath Richmond on a map. But we just learned that the reservoir is between Orinda and Richmond, right? So, no, the hypothesis is not true. The San Pablo Reservoir is not underneath Richmond.

Explanation: If a person loses consciousness and less air reaches the windpipe, it directly impacts the first step of the process, which is air being taken into the body via the nose or mouth. When less air is taken in, it affects the entire process, potentially leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood and compromised carbon dioxide removal."},{"question":"Here is an article: At a course, the Old Course at St. Andrews, where Tiger won a British Open by eight shots 15 years ago, there was a time during the second round of this British Open when he was already 15 shots off the lead. So it has come to that for the guy who used to be the biggest star we had in sports. Of course we have found out over the past several years in sports how fast and how far our stars can fall. We have seen it with Alex Rodriguez and have seen it from Lance Armstrong, who now rides in charity events on the Tour de France course and probably wishes he had a team to take him back the way the Yankees took Rodriguez back, even before they — or he — knew he could still hit the way he has this season, all the way through that go-ahead home run he hit the other way against the Mariners on Friday night at the Stadium. FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \\"LIKE\\" US HERE But mostly we keep seeing it from Tiger Woods, who can’t make the cut now at major golf championships as he moves up on his 40th birthday. And if you’re expecting big things from him in majors the rest of the way, go check out how even the most famous golfers who ever played have done in golf major championships after their 40th birthdays. The other day I was talking to Tom Kite, a major champion at the U.S. Open in Pebble Beach in 1992 and who finished second to Tiger at the ’97 Masters, by 12 shots that year. It was the year, by the way, when Kite famously described himself as having won the “first flight” championship at Augusta National. Kite was breaking down Tiger’s new swing, which isn’t the new swing he got from Sean Foley, and isn’t the new swing he got from Hank Haney, and certainly isn’t the old swing he had when Butch Harmon, the best coach there is, was in charge of quality control. Kite was talking about the injuries Tiger has had to his knees, and the problems he now has with his left side as he attacks a golf ball. “From what I see, he’s just getting ahead of himself,” Kite said after a lot of analysis a lot more technical than that. But it is more than just his swing, which looks like something that has had way too much cosmetic surgery. So many commentators who finally watched Woods put some good rounds together at the Greenbrier, where he was back in the 60s and finished a half-dozen shots out of a playoff, and who watched his practice rounds at St. Andrews (where he won another British Open in 2005) were amazed at how once again Woods was such a complete failure taking his practice-round swing and practice-tee swing to the first tee of a major championship. He started chunking balls on the first hole and shot 40 on the front nine, and you thought he was on his way to another 80 in a major. He finished with a 76, and then at one point on Friday when a Brit named Danny Willett was in the lead at 9-under, at a time when so many golfers had gone low at the Old Course, Woods really was 15 behind and looking at missing the cut in Scotland the way he had at Chambers Bay. So no, it isn’t just all the surgeries he has had, to his knees and back. This is Woods, who won everything for a while and had the Tiger Slam if not the traditional Grand Slam in golf that Jordan Spieth is chasing, being confronted by the same enemies that have confronted golfers who never came close to knowing the success that he did as he was sprinting to 14 majors and chasing Jack Nicklaus. Those enemies are age and injury and nerves and fear and choking, especially choking at majors right now, with a driver in his hands or a putter or even a wedge. The wonderful CBS commentator Gary McCord was telling me once about what happens in golf when you start missing putts. McCord said that before long there’s a ripple effect from all the short putts and birdie putts that don’t fall that runs through your entire game. “And then,” McCord said, “it’s in your DNA.” It’s in Tiger’s DNA right now, even just a couple of years from when he was still good enough to win five tournaments in a year, and even with him telling us, every time he does shoot a good score and perhaps reads the hero-worship coverage he still gets sometimes, how close he is to being back to what he used to be. He can’t drive it straight and though he can get hot with the putter sometimes, he looks nothing at all like the guy who made everything he looked at for 10 years. It doesn’t mean he won’t win again. There are plenty of stories about aging golfers surprising us all. There was a time just recently when three over-40 golfers in a row won British Opens, Darren Clarke and Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson. There was a time when the great Tom Watson, hitting the ball as well as he ever did, went through nearly a decade of putting yips. Somehow Watson, because of the force of his athletic character, found his way to the other side of that, and won a lot of big senior tournaments. And nearly won his sixth British Open at the age of 59 at Turnberry six years ago. But for now, and for a while now, this has been as stunning a fall for a sports champion, and a sports star like this, as we have ever seen. Once, he was the athlete after Michael Jordan retired we most wanted to watch. We still want to watch him when he’s on television. But it’s like a bad reality show these days, built around really bad golf. All we are saying is give Spieth a chance, Wright or wrong & Serena rocks.... -- It would be a tremendous thing for golf if Jordan Spieth wins the third leg of the Grand Slam. But I’m rooting for Dustin Johnson to win the British Open, if they ever finish it, that is. Having watched in person as Tom Watson won British Opens in Scotland, watching him take that walk on the 18th at St. Andrews on Friday was one of the most unforgettable scenes in the history of the tournament, and of the place. We’re not on our way to the Canyon of Heroes because the Knicks played well in the summer league, but you have to admit, the Latvian Mamba looked pretty good, didn’t he? And if you’re wondering how much Knicks fans are starving for any kind of good news, look at the play Mr. Porzingis got for throwing one back on Jahlil Okafor. Curtis Strange and Paul Azinger are still as good at golf commentary as you can find anywhere. Those “nightmares” LeBron James says he’s been having since the NBA Finals ended — did they start before or after we saw him on those banana boats in the Bahamas with his special basketball friends? We are about to find out, before the trade deadline in baseball, how much of a chance the Mets really think they have against the Washington Nationals, or how much they’re willing to give up to compete all the way for the second wild card in the National League. -- Everybody knows how much I like David Wright, and how hard I am rooting for him to come back and be the old David Wright for the Mets, instead of just an old David Wright. He is as nice as anyone, and that includes Yogi, I have ever covered in a New York baseball clubhouse. But there can be no Franchise Four list of New York Mets that doesn’t have Doc Gooden on it. I’m not sure, when you add everything up, that Mike Piazza deserves to be on that list more than Darryl Strawberry, or even Gary Carter. And when you look at the whole grand scheme of things, I happen to think you can make a case that William Hayward (Mookie) Wilson could have made the cut, too. After some pretty dark times in New York sports, it wasn’t such a terrible thing to have the Yankees in first place at the All-Star Break and the Mets in second, all of that happening in the shadow of the run the Rangers made in the spring. When I turned on the British Open Saturday morning, I was waiting for the flying cow from “Twister” to come by when one of the golfers was trying to mark his ball. -- I’m so happy that Mark Cuban and Steve Ballmer were able to work things out without couples counseling. Seriously? Is there anything more difficult to watch than billionaires with relationship issues? My favorite thing this week was listening to all this hand-wringing from pundits in Cable America about a deal with Iran none of them had read. Even our guy Trump, as he was killing the deal, sounded like he was working off Cliffs Notes. -- What we are witnessing from Serena Williams is one of the great finishing kicks in the history of her sport or any sport. She has now won as many major championships after the age of 30 as Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi won in their entire careers. And as for the other player who won Wimbledon last weekend, just know this about Novak Djokovic: He came along at the time when both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were in their primes, before Federer turned 30 himself, and on their way to winning 31 majors between them. Now Djokovic has whipped them both. Somehow, even on the way to those 17 majors, Federer couldn’t beat Nadal, at least not nearly enough. In his twilight, in so many big moments, now he can’t beat Djokovic. I thought Caitlyn Jenner’s speech at the ESPY Awards was terrific. But somebody has to explain to me why some reaction shots of Brett Favre turned him into some sort of public enemy on social media. What, he’s a bad guy because he didn’t weep? Four games for Tom Brady? I still don’t think he’s going to accept four minutes. -- The mayor of New York City sounds as upset about Uber as he did about horse-drawn carriages in Central Park. The big guy better watch it, because if he gets rid of Uber, people all over town are going to start being as late for stuff as he is. “Lupica” can be heard Monday through Friday at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 9 a.m. on ESPN 98.7.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - Over the Hills and Far Away is the first EP by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish , released in 2001 through both Spinefarm Records and Drakkar Records . Bassist Sami Vänskä would leave the band after the recording of this CD , due to musical differences between him and Tuomas Holopainen , to be replaced by the current bassist and male vocalist , Marco Hietala . The editions by Drakkar and Century Media contain different additional live tracks taken from the live DVD From Wishes to Eternity , recorded in Tampere , Finland , on 29 December 2000 .

The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer. - Marko Tapani \\"Marco\\" Hietala (born 14 January 1966) is a Finnish heavy metal vocalist, bass guitarist and songwriter. Internationally, he is most known as the current bass guitarist, male vocalist and secondary composer to Tuomas Holopainen, of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is also the vocalist and bassist as well as composer and lyricist for the heavy metal band Tarot. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Erno \\"Emppu\\" Matti Juhani Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish.

A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - Angels Fall First is the debut studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. The original 500-copies limited edition features seven tracks, two of which are not on the regular edition. This edition is highly sought after by collectors and in 2012 a copy was sold for 1137.23 on eBay. The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001. - The tarot (first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi, tarock, and others) is a pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian tarocchini and French tarot. In the late 18th century, it began to be used for divination in the form of tarotology/cartomancy. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Sami Vänskä (born 26 September 1976) is the former bassist of Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish. - Jukka Antero \\"Julius\\" Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, Kitee, Finland) is the drummer in the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Finnish progressive metal band Sethian. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (born 25 December 1976) is a Finnish songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician (but mainly keyboardist) and record producer, best known as the founder, leader, keyboardist and songwriter of symphonic metal band Nightwish. He has also studied jazz and classical styles, but prefers to be influenced by harmonic film music. - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

There is no specific information provided about the drinks being alcoholic or non-alcoholic. It could be any drink like water, juice, soda, or milk. Therefore, assuming that they are drinking alcohol may not be a valid interpretation unless there is any supporting context provided. The second part of the sentence, \\"as the young boy makes a phone call,\\" tells us that a young boy is using a phone to make a call at the same time as the children are sipping their drinks. There is no information in the provided sentence about whom the young boy is calling. It is not mentioned that he is calling his dead grandma. Without further context, we cannot assume this as part of the story. To conclude, the original sentence does not necessarily mean that the children are drinking alcohol or that the young boy is calling his dead grandmother. The given statement merely describes a situation where children are consuming drinks while a young boy is making a phone call. Any assumptions beyond these observable actions would need additional contextual clues or information."},{"question":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which town had more growth of algae because of fertilizer? Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. The answer to this question is:","response":"Big town"},{"question":"Translate to Czech: However promising the idea may be, it is reasonable to doubt whether there will be sufficient investment to implement it. Czech:","response":"\\"Ať už je nápad sebeperspektivnější, je rozumné pochybovat, zda bude dostatek investic na jeho realizaci.\\" Here is the step-by-step translation process and the logic behind it: \\"However promising the idea may be\\" can be translated as \\"Ať už je nápad sebeperspektivnější\\". In Czech, the phrase \\"Ať už\\" is used to express \\"however\\" or \\"regardless of\\", and \\"sebeperspektivnější\\" means \\"the most promising\\". Czech language often uses the superlative degree to express the same sentiment as English language using the comparative degree. \\"it is reasonable to doubt\\" can be translated as \\"je rozumné pochybovat\\". This phrase is quite direct. I replaced \\"it\\" with \\"je\\", \\"is reasonable\\" with \\"rozumné\\", and \\"to doubt\\" with \\"pochybovat\\". \\"whether there will be sufficient investment to implement it\\" can be translated as \\"zda bude dostatek investic na jeho realizaci\\". Again, there's a fairly direct translation available. \\"Whether\\" is \\"zda\\", \\"there will be\\" is \\"bude\\", \\"sufficient\\" is \\"dostatek\\", \\"investment\\" is \\"investic\\", \\"to implement\\" is \\"na realizaci\\", and \\"it\\" can be replaced by \\"jeho\\", which means \\"its\\". Each part of the sentence was translated by taking into account the grammatical rules and semantic nuances of both English and Czech languages. It was also crucial to ensure the final translation sounds natural to a native Czech speaker, thus, equivalent translations expressing the same idea but with different wordings were used where necessary ."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: GO (previously GO NYC), is a \\"cultural roadmap for the city girl,\\" and is the nation's most widely distributed, free, lesbian magazine.

Step 1: Identify the parts of speech. - \\"I\\" is a pronoun. - \\"know\\" is a verb. - \\"you\\" is a pronoun. - \\"like\\" is a preposition. - \\"the\\" is an article. - \\"back\\" is a noun. - \\"of\\" is a preposition. - \\"my\\" is a possessive pronoun. - \\"hand\\" is a noun. Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure. - The sentence has a main clause \\"I know you\\". - The prepositional phrase \\"like the back of my hand\\" functions as an adverb, modifying the verb \\"know\\". Step 3: Check for grammatical correctness. - The sentence has a clear subject (\\"I\\"), verb (\\"know\\"), and object (\\"you\\"). - The adverbial phrase \\"like the back of my hand\\" provides additional information about the degree to which the speaker knows the addressee. - The prepositions, article, possessive pronoun, and nouns in the adverbial phrase are all used correctly. Step 4: Evaluate idiomatic expressions. - \\"Like the back of my hand\\" is an idiomatic expression used to convey that someone knows something or someone extremely well. Based on this step-by-step analysis, a linguist would likely rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically. The sentence has proper parts of speech, sentence structure, and grammatical correctness, along with incorporating an idiomatic expression to convey a specific meaning."},{"question":"Premise: A young boy jumping into the pool wearing goggles. Hypothesis: A boy jumps into a pool to try and touch the bottom. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","response":"Based on the premise provided, we can not definitively conclude the hypothesis. The premise sets the stage for a young boy jumping into a pool while wearing goggles, but it does not provide enough information to assume the boy's intentions or motivations for doing so. The hypothesis suggests that the boy jumps into the pool to try and touch the bottom, which is plausible, but it is not the only possible reason for the boy's actions. Firstly, the premise states that a young boy is jumping into the pool while wearing goggles. This can be analyzed as two separate points of information: 1. The boy is jumping into the pool. 2. The boy is wearing goggles. The boy jumping into the pool can have various reasons behind the action, such as wanting to cool off during a hot day or wanting to practice his swimming skills. It could also be because his friends are already in the pool, and he does not want to miss out on joining them. Furthermore, the boy could be participating in a swimming lesson or have accepted a dare to jump into the pool. The second piece of information we have is that the boy is wearing goggles. The use of goggles might indicate that the boy wants to protect his eyes from the effects of the chlorine in the pool water or be prepared for underwater activities such as swimming laps or observing underwater life. Goggles may also be an essential part of his swimming gear and utilized more for comfort purposes than any need to go underwater, as he may not be confident enough not to get water into his eyes as he enters the pool. Combining these two pieces of information, we can infer that the young boy is entering the pool with the intent of engaging in some water activity, and the goggles will help him see clearly underwater. However, this still does not provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that he is trying to touch the bottom of the pool, as there could be numerous underwater activities he could partake in without attempting to reach the bottom. It is essential to consider alternative hypotheses that could explain the boy's actions, such as: - The boy is practicing his diving or cannonball skills, and the goggles protect his eyes upon impact with the water. - The boy intends to play underwater games or sports with his friends, and the goggles will help him see clearly while submerged. - The boy merely enjoys the sensation of being underwater and observing his surroundings, and the goggles provide him the opportunity to do so without discomfort. In conclusion, while the hypothesis that a boy jumps into a pool to try and touch the bottom is certainly plausible based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude this to be the case without more information. The boy's intentions and the specific circumstances surrounding this scenario could lead to alternative explanations for this action, so it's essential not to draw firm conclusions based solely on the premise provided."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text.

In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini.

To answer this question, students should mention the following points derived from the passage: 1. The term \\"cardinalis\\" was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. 2. In the early 6th century, the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of Rome. 3.

The club is a member of both the Rugby Football Union and the Scottish Rugby Union. The club shares the Athletic Ground with Richmond. - The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), or \\"Aonadh Rugbaidh na h-Alba\\" in Scottish Gaelic, is the governing body of rugby union in Scotland. It is the second oldest Rugby Union, having been founded in 1873, as the Scottish Football Union. The SRU oversees the national league system, known as the Scottish League Championship. The SRU is headed by the President (Ed Crozier) and Chairman (Sir Moir Lockhead), with Mark Dodson acting as the Chief Executive Officer. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line. - William Edward \`\` Bill '' Maclagan ( 5 April 1858 -- 10 October 1926 ) was a Scottish international rugby union forward who played club rugby for London Scottish F.C. . Maclagan was one of the longest - serving international rugby players during the early development of the sport , and was awarded 25 caps for Scotland . He played international rugby for thirteen seasons , a Scottish record for sixty years , and led the first official British Isles team on its 1891 tour of South Africa . Maclagan 's contributions to the early development of rugby were recognised in 2009 with his induction into the IRB Hall of Fame . - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area. - The Rugby Football Union (RFU) is the governing body for rugby union in England. It was founded in 1871, and was the sport's international governing body prior to the formation of what is now known as World Rugby (WR) in 1886. It promotes and runs the sport, organises international matches for the England national team, and educates and trains players and officials. - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.

US Central Command (Centcom), which both conducted and investigated the 17 September strike, said the attack stemmed from a “good faith” mistake that led targeters to believe the Syrian fighters, whom Centcom said did not wear uniforms, were Islamic State (Isis) militants. British, Australian and Danish warplanes also participated in the attack and released their weapons on the mistaken target, according to US air force Brig Gen Richard Coe, the investigating officer. Coe stopped short of apologizing to the Syrian government, saying such a statement was beyond the purview of his six-week investigation. The strikes occurred in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, where the US bombs Isis fighters and positions almost every day, and where known regime loyalists are relatively few. Due to the lack of observable insignia, Centcom would not say definitively that it had killed Syrian soldiers. “We made an unintentional, regrettable error, based on several factors in the targeting process,” Coe told reporters on Tuesday, who said he found “no intent to target Syrian [government] forces”. Coe’s investigators were unable to access the scene of the strike, a few kilometers north of the Deir ez-Zor airfield, and the Russian military – which is supporting Assad’s campaign against Isis and rebel opposition forces – did not participate in the inquiry. An initial report on the incident by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested that 83 people had been killed. Coe said that on the basis of contemporaneous video evidence and interviews, he could only definitively determine 15 dead regime loyalists, but added that the death toll was likely to be higher. Soon after the incident on 17 September, Centcom said that it had halted airstrikes in progress in Deir ez-Zor after speaking to Russian officials on a channel established to deconflict the two countries’ air campaigns over Syria. In that conversation, the Russians informed their US counterparts that the targets of the strike were probably “part of the Syrian military”. The conversation turned out to be crucial. A US military officer misidentified the coordinates of the targeted area, and presumed from the lack of Russian objection that there was no problem with the intended strike. But Centcom said on Tuesday that the Russians made a “critical delay” before informing the US of the mistake, waiting 27 minutes for a “familiar US counterpart” to be reached. During that time, 15 of the total 32 airstrikes occurred. Coe gave the Russians a measure of credit: “Without that call from the Russians, the strikes would have continued for longer than they did.” Coe described the planning process for the strike unfolding over at least two days with “multiple, multiple” shift changes “in different parts of the globe” contributing to human error. The intended strikes were substantial: warplanesand drones released 34 guided weapons and 380 rounds of 30mm ammunition on what Coe described as “defensive fighting positions, vehicles, tents, bed-down locations, tunnels and personnel”. The presence of a tank tipped at least one intelligence analyst to conclude that the target was not Isis, but Coe said the analyst’s assessment was neither widely distributed nor fully accurate, as earlier airstrikes against Isis had hit tanks commandeered from the Syrian regime. The tank appears to have convinced strike planners that they had located a major Isis target, and what began as a deliberate strike expanded, blurring targeting procedures, as officers and analysts became convinced they had a major target of opportunity in their crosshairs. “Constantly challenging our own conclusions in these processes is something we need to do every time,” Coe said. The admission of fault by the US military is the latest potential sign that the US under Donald Trump will acquiesce to a Syria under Assad’s rule. Since his election, speculation has mounted that Trump will drop Barack Obama’s calls for Assad to relinquish power. Trump has expressed respect for Assad’s patron, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and portrayed US support for the anti-Assad opposition forces as a disaster. Earlier this month, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that “Syria is fighting Isis”, indicating a lack of appetite for the US to undermine the enemy of its enemy. Trump is unlikely to arm the Syrian opposition – a policy advocated by David Petraeus, whom Trump is considering for secretary of state – because “we have no idea who these people are”. He acknowledged to the paper: “I’ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria.” Assad has sounded cautiously enthusiastic since Trump’s victory, describing the president-elect as “a natural ally” to Portuguese television. The US admission of error comes as Assad, backed by the Russian air force, is poised for a critical victory in the northern city of Aleppo, a former center of manufacturing that years of war have turned into a graveyard. Tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing Aleppo in advance of a final bombardment that Russian leaflets reportedly describe as a pending “annihilation”. Coe’s investigation also provided a new level of detail into the US-Russian “deconfliction” channel, established last year after the Russian air force entered the war on Assad’s behalf. During the 17 September conversation with the Russians, the US delivered highly precise but ultimately mistaken coordinates for the intended attack, as an analyst miscommunicated. Coe said it was the “first time” that the US had called the Russians in advance of a strike with such precise location information. “We would have a large number of aircraft operating in that small airspace for an extended period of time and we wanted to obviously notify the Russians so they’d be aware of our activities there,” Coe said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The US military has admitted responsibility for an airstrike in eastern Syria in September that killed at least 15 Syrian fighters loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Although the US Central Command (Centcom) stated that the attack was based on a “good faith” mistake that led planners to think the targeted fighters were ISIS militants, the admission serves as further evidence that the Trump administration could be prepared to accept Assad's continued rule of Syria. The strikes occurred in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, where US forces had noted the presence of relatively few regime loyalists.⟩"},{"question":"no matter how the method of choosing taiwan 's leaders changes , it will not change taiwan being part of china , a spokesman for the npc said at a press conference here today .

The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right. Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. The Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774. The Western European Enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of Bulgaria. It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed...

Slice pizza dough into slices or small rectangular pieces.. B). Take the pieces of pizza out of the fridge, and unfold each piece. Sprinkle an evenly amount of pepper sauce on each piece.. C). When it's cool in your house, open up the remaining slices and add 1/2 cup of butter to the middle. Butter will melt if it comes out too warm.. D). While frozen from freezer bag, every time you take it out of the freezer pack it will chill at room temperature. Take out the pizza crust and cut it in half using a knife..","response":"The most logical next event in the process of making folder's arm pizza is as follows: E). Preparing the pizza toppings and assembling the pizza. 1. Prepare the toppings: Gather all the ingredients you want to use as toppings for your pizza. This may include vegetables like onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and olives, as well as proteins like pepperoni, sausage, grilled chicken, or ham. You can also include a variety of cheeses, such as mozzarella, cheddar, or gouda. Wash and chop the vegetables, and cook any raw meats (like sausage or bacon) before placing them on the pizza. 2. Assemble the pizza: Take the unfolded pizza dough out of the refrigerator, and preheat your oven to around 475°F (245°C). If you are using store-bought pizza dough or a premade crust, follow the instructions on the package for the appropriate oven temperature. 3. Spread a layer of your chosen sauce (tomato sauce, pesto, alfredo, etc.) evenly across the surface of the pizza dough. Be careful not to apply too much sauce, as this may cause the dough to become soggy. 4. Next, distribute a layer of your desired cheese evenly over the sauce. The cheese will act as a barrier between the sauce and the toppings, which will help to prevent the toppings from sinking into the dough. 5. Arrange your chosen toppings on the pizza. You can create a pattern, or simply scatter the toppings evenly across the surface of the pizza. 6. Place the pizza in the preheated oven, and bake it for approximately 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. 7. Remove the pizza from the oven, and allow it to cool for a few minutes before slicing it. This will make it easier to handle and help the cheese set. 8. Continuation of the Folder's arm pizza process: Once the pizza has cooled down a bit, fold each slice in half, ensuring that the toppings and cheese are adequately enclosed within the dough. Place the folded pizza slices on a plate or pizza pan, and store them in the refrigerator for 10-30 minutes until they are cool. 9. Serving and storage: You can serve the folder's arm pizza immediately, or save them for later by storing them in an airtight container or plastic freezer bag. When you are ready to eat them, simply take the folded pizza out of the container or bag, and let it come to room temperature.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger\\". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. After the Beatles' return to London, George Harrison replied to a question about their long-term plans: \\"We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans.\\" His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup. Upon the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak. In November 1966, during a return flight to London from Kenya, where he had been on holiday with Beatles tour manager Mal Evans, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. His idea involved an Edwardian-era military band, for which Evans invented a name in the style of contemporary San Francisco-based groups such as Big Brother and the Holding Company and Quicksilver Messenger Service. In February 1967, McCartney suggested that the Beatles should record an entire album that would represent a performance by the fictional band. This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically. He explained: \\"I thought, let's not be ourselves. Let's develop alter egos.\\" Martin remembered: \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" itself didn't appear until halfway through making the album. It was Paul's song, just an ordinary rock number ... but when we had finished it, Paul said, \\"Why don't we make the album as though the Pepper band really existed, as though Sergeant Pepper was making the record? We'll dub in effects and things.\\" I loved the idea, and from that moment on it was as though Pepper had a life of its own. In 1966, the American musician and bandleader Brian Wilson's growing interest in the aesthetics of recording and his admiration for both record producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and the Beatles' album Rubber Soul resulted in the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds LP, which demonstrated his production expertise and his mastery of composition and arrangement. The author Thomas MacFarlane credits the release with influencing many musicians of the time, with McCartney in particular singing its praises and drawing inspiration to \\"expand the focus of the Beatles' work with sounds and textures not usually associated with popular music\\". McCartney thought that his constant playing of the album made it difficult for Lennon to \\"escape the influence\\", adding: \\"It's very cleverly done ... so we were inspired by it and nicked a few ideas.\\" Martin stated: \\"Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper never would have happened ... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\\" Freak Out! by the Mothers of Invention has also been cited as having influenced Sgt. Pepper. According to the author Philip Norman, during the Sgt. Pepper recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \\"This is our Freak Out!\\" The music journalist Chet Flippo states that McCartney was inspired to record a concept album after hearing Freak Out!, considered the first rock concept album. Sgt. Pepper, according to American musicologist Allan F. Moore, is composed mainly of rock and pop music, while Michael Hannan and Naphtali Wagner both believed it is an album of various genres; Hannan said it features \\"a broad variety of musical and theatrical genres\\". According to Hannan and Wagner, the music incorporates the stylistic influences of rock and roll, vaudeville, big band, piano jazz, blues, chamber, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. Wagner felt the album's music reconciles the \\"diametrically opposed aesthetic ideals\\" of classical and psychedelia, achieving a \\"psycheclassical synthesis\\" of the two forms. Musicologist John Covach describes Sgt. Pepper as \\"proto-progressive\\". Concerns that some of the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper refer to recreational drug use led to the BBC banning several songs from British radio, such as \\"A Day in the Life\\" because of the phrase \\"I'd love to turn you on\\", with the BBC claiming that it could \\"encourage a permissive attitude towards drug-taking.\\" Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity. The meaning of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the song's title was code for the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The BBC banned the track on those grounds. They also banned \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" because of the lyric, which mentions \\"Henry the Horse\\", a phrase that contains two common slang terms for heroin. Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" was a reference to heroin use. Others noted lyrics such as \\"I get high\\" from \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"take some tea\\" - slang for cannabis use - from \\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"digging the weeds\\" from \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". The author Sheila Whiteley attributes Sgt. Pepper's underlying philosophy not only to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement. The musicologist Oliver Julien views the album as an embodiment of \\"the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s\\". The American psychologist and counterculture figure Timothy Leary contends that the LP \\"gave a voice to the feeling that the old ways were over ... it came along at the right time\\" and stressed the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda. The album's primary value, according to Moore, is its ability to \\"capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place\\". Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with \\"provid[ing] a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love\\". Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of Sgt. Pepper's lyrics, identifying loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions as the most prominent themes. What was important about the lyrics?","response":"The lyrics of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band were important for several reasons. First, they represented the album's embodiment of the social, musical, and cultural changes of the 1960s. The album expressed a need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda and captured the spirit of the times, including the flower power movement, metaphysics, and the drug culture. It provided a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love. Second, the lyrics in several songs led to speculation about their connection to recreational drug use. The BBC banned some songs from British radio due to concerns that the lyrics either directly or ambiguously referred to drug use or promoted a permissive attitude towards drug-taking. Some examples include \\"A Day in the Life,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" \\"Lovely Rita,\\" and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". Despite the denials of John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the time, McCartney later admitted that some lyrics were deliberately ambiguous. Lastly, the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper explored various themes, including the loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions. These themes contributed to the album's ability to capture its own time and place, making it a landmark work in popular music history. This is further highlighted by the fact that several scholars have applied hermeneutic strategies to analyze the album's lyrics, demonstrating the importance of the album both for its time and its continued relevance."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - San Felipe is a municipality in Retalhuleu Department , situated on the road to Quetzaltenango between El Palmar , Quetzaltenango to the north - west and San Martin Zapotitlan to the south side . - Quetzaltenango is a department in the western highlands of Guatemala.

Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him.

And the sole reason to fight cocks is to bet on them. It is an activity so popular among Cubans that stopping it would pose a huge challenge for the authorities and would be counterproductive. I spoke to a man named Yurien, who said, “President Raul likes cockfighting, our commanders Ramiro and Guillermo also like it, and we like it. Cockfighting is a part of Cuba so we do it with order and discipline. It is unstoppable. There are also a few legal arenas set up by the state, and even in those betting exists, but in a quiet and discreet way.” The most impressive site used for illegal cockfighting I visited was a military anti-aircraft shelter built into the side of a hill on the outskirts of a Cuban city, reachable after a short trek through thick bush. It struck me as a place in the middle of nowhere. The site was full of people enjoying an afternoon with their favorite pastime, cockfighting. As I arrived a man quickly came over with the entry tickets, in a highly organized manner. The fights were on and the cocks were safe, very safe, in the shade of the underground bunker. When I was leaving the bunker I met a boy carrying his injured fighting cock through the bush. His bird had lost the fight that day and he was sad. He said, “We will be back to win. I will cure my bird, and he will be back, even if now he only has one eye.” To reach the fight arena you have to know exactly where you are going, and when the fights are to take place. There are not signs, no announcements. This site and others are always concealed and hidden away down a dirt road lane and in the bush on the outskirts any Cuban city. Curiously, the steep paths or the bits of the lane on which car wheels skid in mud when it rains, are paved, yes, paved with asphalt. Money has been invested to ensure that participants and spectators make it to the site even if it rains. After the adventure of finding the site, suddenly in the middle of nowhere one finds people milling around and dozens of cars, many of them the typical pre-1959 models that have been restored and look like from their best times, tractors, horse-drawn carts, motorbikes and trucks all parked in a proper parking lot with a guard. There is electricity in the air and excitement everywhere. It is the day. A checkpoint manned by three or four men marks the entrance, and after paying a fee, you realize it is a serious place for serious business. But the whole thing can be quickly dismantled, loaded on trucks and set up elsewhere, in only a few hours. The sites are always practical and well built wooden structures covered with a thatched roof or tarpaulins to cater to hundreds of people. Apart from the main fight arena, other thatched structures surround the place as kiosks offering food, drinks, tobacco and other amenities for the spectators. There are cold drinks, roast pork, rice and beans, sandwiches and other snacks being offered. If you need to go to the toilet you just walk into the bush. There are dozens of these set-ups around Cuba where thousands of dollars are won and lost. A front row position can cost up to 10, or one further back can go for 4. Money flows freely as people go around holding huge wads of notes. There are also always tables to play cards, and bets are placed on the cocks before and during the fights. Each proud owner carries his animal with pride. Some birds can easily sell for 1,000. There are cocks of breeds from India, Mexico, Spain and many other countries. It is a very specialized trade and they enter the country in the form of a fertilized egg to be incubated in Cuba, since importing live animals is prohibited. Before the fights start, cock owners mill around the weigh-in point, and the birds are officially weighed and assigned a category. Once that’s completed, the different fights are arranged. The fighting cocks are the real stars of the show. After long months of training they are given pedicures, fitted with a sharp claw, endure sessions of feather-dressing, grooming and extreme clipping. The feathers on their legs and body are clipped, giving them a strange semi-human, semi-chicken look. The birds are treated like kings as they are carried in special boxes, and they are fed special food. To breed fighting cocks is a fine and very specialized occupation done by only a few. When I watched my first cockfight I realized that the birds use their back claw to kill each other in a very fast movement. All I could see was a ball of feathers swirling around, so during the fights I began to watch other interesting elements at the event – the bird owners and the crowd. It struck me that for the first time I was observing human beings turning into fighting roosters. The owners of the cocks are allowed to stand beside their animals like a coach along a boxing ring. They continuously dance around their birds, chuckling like excited cocks, salivating and sweating profusely. They literally enter a into a semi-trance with their eyes rolling. Some of them move their arms and legs as if they are the birds themselves, and don’t stop cooing and chuckling. Between rounds, they pick up their roosters as if they were wounded children, and lovingly lick their wounds. I saw one of them furiously blowing spit on his bird’s behind after chuckling into its ear and kissing and licking its beak. A truly surreal sight. There is a boiling frenzy as the fight starts, and it continues right to the end, with many people shouting bets furiously at the same time, waving their fat wads of money, moving their arms, legs, heads and whole bodies. The wooden structure bends and moves, and the air is so dense with excitement it is difficult to describe. Everyone knows that it is all an illegal activity, and that makes it even more exciting. A lot money has been placed on the birds; the outcome will leave losers with dead or severely injured birds and winners with more money in their pocket. Photography is absolutely not allowed, but in Cuba nothing and everything is possible. It all depends on how a photographer approaches the challenge. It is a question of first of all becoming part of the woodwork, which takes some time, and choosing very carefully when and what to shoot. Obviously big professional cameras are not much help in this kind of scene. To do the pictures for this story I used cellphones, a Gopro Hero 2, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3 and the Canon EOS 5D Mark II, depending on the situation. Write a title for it.","response":"Cuba's Underground World of Illegal Cockfighting"},{"question":"Given the question: Are Kalimeris and Podranea both genus of plants ?

During his playing career, Ganguly established himself as one of the world's leading batsmen and also one of the greatest captains of the national cricket team. While batting, he was especially prolific through the off side, earning himself the nickname God of the Off Side for his elegant strokeplay square of the wicket and through the covers. Sourav Ganguly is one of the four members of the Indian Premier League's Governing Council, responsible for all the functions of the tournament. Sourav Ganguly was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta, and is the youngest son of Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly. Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the 'Maharaja', meaning the 'Great King'. Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness. Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time. Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under-15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: how was his early life?","response":"Sourav Ganguly's early life was quite comfortable and luxurious, as he was born into a wealthy family in Calcutta.

Translate to English English:","response":"In order to eliminate these barriers, my report emphasizes in particular the need to achieve a solution in the matter of standardization of intermodal loading units and to facilitate the integration of short sea shipping into the transport chain. The removal of these obstacles is crucial for the development of an efficient and sustainable transport system. Intermodal transportation is the use of two or more modes of transport in a single journey, such as road, rail, and sea. This approach is environmentally friendly, as it reduces the emissions and energy consumption associated with transportation. Furthermore, it can lead to cost savings and a more effective use of resources. Achieving standardization in intermodal loading units is an essential step towards more efficient and seamless transport connections. Intermodal loading units include containers, swap bodies, and semi-trailers that are designed to be easily transferred between different modes of transportation. Standardization of these units will facilitate the smooth and efficient movement of goods, making it easier for transport operators to switch between different modes and potentially increasing the overall efficiency of the transport system. To enhance the integration of short sea shipping into the transport chain, several initiatives can be considered. First, improving port infrastructure and facilities can help attract more short sea shipping traffic and ensure that ports are equipped to handle the increasing demand. This may include investing in modern technologies, such as automation and digital platforms for managing logistics operations. Second, stronger cooperation between various stakeholders in the transportation sector, such as shipping companies, terminal operators, and freight forwarders, should be encouraged. This can lead to the development of coordinated transport services and better integration of short sea shipping into the overall transportation network. In addition, promoting the use of sustainable alternative fuels and technological innovations in shipping can contribute to the reduction of environmental impact and increase the competitiveness of short sea shipping. Investing in research and development, as well as providing incentives for the adoption of low-emission technologies, can help advance the sector and ensure its future growth. Finally, supporting policies and regulations that facilitate the growth of short sea shipping are vital. For instance, simplifying administrative procedures and customs formalities, harmonizing regulations across different countries, and ensuring fair competition between different transport modes can all contribute to the further development of short sea shipping as an integral part of a sustainable and efficient transport system.

Alfred Cellier (1 December 1844 - 28 December 1891) was an English composer, orchestrator and conductor. In addition to conducting and music directing the original productions of several of the most famous Gilbert and Sullivan works and writing the overtures to some of them, Cellier conducted at many theatres in London, New York and on tour in Britain, America and Australia. He composed over a dozen operas and other works for the theatre, as well as for orchestra, but his 1886 comic opera, Dorothy, was by far his most successful work. It became the longest-running piece of musical theatre in the nineteenth century. In 1885, Cellier composed a song, \\"There once was a time, my darling\\", for a piece produced by George Edwardes, Little Jack Sheppard (1885). Meanwhile he had composed what would become his greatest success, the comic opera Dorothy, with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson. To create the score, Cellier repurposed some of his music from his 1876 failure, Nell Gwynne, which had, nevertheless, received praise for its music. Dorothy had been announced for production at the Royalty Theatre in 1884, but ultimately Edwardes mounted it at his Gaiety Theatre on 25 September 1886. Cellier was in Australia from February 1886 to February 1887, conducting The Mikado and other Gilbert and Sullivan operas for the J. C. Williamson organization and was absent from London during the productions of The Carp, at the Savoy, and Dorothy. Neither the music nor the libretto of Dorothy initially attracted critical praise. The Times wrote, \\"Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality.\\" Stephenson rewrote the lyrics of one of Cellier's old songs, \\"Old Dreams\\" as \\"Queen of My Heart\\"; this helped the work to find success after it transferred in December to the Prince of Wales Theatre. The following year H. J. Leslie took over the production from Edwardes and introduced new stars, including Marie Tempest. Dorothy became an even greater success at the box office and transferred in December 1888 to the Lyric Theatre, built using the profits from the production, where it ran into 1889. Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time, longer than even The Mikado, a fact that caused consternation to Cellier's friend Arthur Sullivan. Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece, and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights David Garrick and Aphra Behn, and to Oliver Goldsmith and even Shakespeare. Its success led to revivals of some of Cellier's earlier works. Cellier returned to Australia in 1888 to conduct Dorothy and made a final brief visit there for health reasons in early 1891, together with Stephenson. His last comic operas, Doris (1889, with Stephenson) and The Mountebanks (with Gilbert, produced in January 1892, a few days after the composer's death), were both modestly successful. Also after Cellier's death, Rutland Barrington used some of his music in his 1902 adaptation of Water Babies. Often in ill health throughout his life, Cellier was unable to finish The Mountebanks, and Ivan Caryll completed the score. Cellier owed much to the influence of Sullivan. He was a fertile melodist, and his writing exhibited elegance and refinement, although he was not able to infuse his music with humour in the way that Sullivan did. Cellier died at his home in Bloomsbury, London, at the age of 47. He was buried in West Norwood Cemetery.","response":"This text is about Alfred Cellier, an English composer, orchestrator, and conductor who was born on December 1, 1844, and died on December 28, 1891.

Hans A:","response":"Title: The Contract of Hans In an action-packed and heart-trenching espionage thriller, we center the story to an uncommonly skilled mercenary named Hans. Hans, an aged but well-built figure with a heavy German accent, is a man of few words, but his reputation echoes loudly in the darkest corners of the international espionage community. Our gripping tale starts in Hamburg, Germany, where Hans, born into post-war poverty and chaos, scavenged a living before being conscripted into the German Special Forces, the KSK. Hans quickly distinguished himself through his innate combat prowess and icy calm under pressure. After a morally challenging incident occurred during his service, Hans quit the KSK, became a soldier of fortune, and spent the next two decades working under numerous flags, always professional, always detached. The plot thickens when a double-cross during an operation in Moscow forces Hans into hiding. His reputation tarnished, he is left with few allies and numerous enemies. The international mercenary guild blacklists him, and Hans moves to a remote town in South Africa to escape, nursing his wounds, both physical and psychological. A mysterious figure named Karl approaches him with a risky but highly lucrative contract, one which could restore Hans' status and allow him to retire. The contract: to eliminate a powerful arms dealer and dictator in Africa responsible for numerous genocides and civil unrest. As the plot unfolds, it's revealed that this despot is protected not just by an army, but also by international politics, making the mission nearly impossible. Hans begins gathering resources and a small team of similarly blacklisted mercenaries, each with its baggage and unique abilities. This motley crew, all seeking redemption in their ways, gradually form a bond deeper than professionalism. As the plot twists and turns with intense combat sequences, heartbreak, and betrayals, we see Hans and his team fight not just the external enemy, but also their personal demons. Hans, especially, battles his haunting past, where he learns that his actions during his time in the KSK were twisted by the people he trusted to inflict immense harm. The climax of the movie will be an exciting showdown in the heavily fortified palace of the dictator. Hans and his team use their combined skills to infiltrate, leaving a swath of controlled chaos behind them. In a final chaotic scene, Hans encounters the despot, prompting an intense hand-to-hand brawl, where Hans eventually subdues him. The resolution brings a cathartic release as Hans and his team accomplish their nearly impossible mission. However, instead of claiming his reward, Hans exposes Karl and the murky political games to the world, leading to an overhaul in global politics in the process. The movie ends with Hans finally escaping from his past and retiring to an anonymous life, at peace with himself. Not just an action thriller, 'The Contract of Hans' explores themes of personal redemption, trust, and the consequences of one's actions, leading to a thought-provoking cinematic experience."},{"question":"Question: when did the civil war start and where I found the following answer on Google: Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively.

He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lever would produce greater increase in force, lever A or lever B? Hint: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. A:","response":"Lever A would produce a greater increase in force because it has an ideal mechanical advantage, meaning there is no friction to overcome.

When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build carbohydrate molecules (Figure 8.9). However, autotrophs only use a few specific components of sunlight. Q: Photosynthesis involves reactions that are dependent on what? Choices: - air - water - food - light A: Answer:","response":"Photosynthesis involves reactions that are dependent on light. In the process of photosynthesis, plants and other photoautotrophs absorb energy from sunlight and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which is a type of carbohydrate molecule. This glucose serves as a source of food and energy for the plant. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis play a crucial role in this process. These reactions take place within the plant and involve the absorption of light by pigments called chlorophyll, found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to drive electron transport chains and produce molecules such as ATP and NADPH, which are high-energy compounds. These energy-rich molecules are then utilized in the subsequent light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle, to fix carbon dioxide into glucose and other organic molecules. The conversion of light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis is essential for the sustenance of life on Earth. Not only do plants and other autotrophs produce their own food through this process, but they also release oxygen as a byproduct. This oxygen is a critical component of Earth's atmosphere and supports the respiration of virtually all living organisms on the planet."},{"question":"Man o' War (March 29, 1917 - November 1, 1947) was an American Thoroughbred who is widely considered one of the greatest racehorses of all time. During his career just after World War I, he won 20 of 21 races and 249,465 (equal to 3,047,451 today) in purses. He was the unofficial 1920 American horse of the year and was honored with Babe Ruth as the outstanding athlete of the year by The New York Times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1957. Man o' War was a chestnut horse with a white star and stripe on his forehead. He was foaled at Nursery Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. He was bred by August Belmont, Jr., whose father's accomplishments were recognized through the naming of the Belmont Stakes in 1867. Belmont Jr. was an equally notable horseman who served as the chairman of The Jockey Club from 1895 until his death in 1924. Belmont Park was named in the family's honor when it opened in 1905. Man o' War was sired by Fair Play, a multiple stakes winner who finished second in the 1908 Belmont Stakes to the undefeated Colin. Man o' War was the second foal out of Mahubah, a lightly raced mare by English Triple Crown Champion Rock Sand. Not long after the colt was foaled on March 29, 1917, Belmont Jr. joined the United States Army at age 65 to serve in France during World War I. While he was overseas, his wife named the foal \\"Man o' War\\" in honor of her husband. Originally, the Belmonts intended to race Man o' War themselves. However, in the summer of 1918 with the ongoing war effort, they decided to liquidate their racing stable. At the Saratoga yearling sale, Man o' War was sold at a final bid of 5,000 (equivalent to 81,000 in 2017) to Samuel D. Riddle, who brought him to his Glen Riddle Farm near Berlin, Maryland. The underbidder at the auction was Robert L. Gerry, Sr., who is reported to have said to his wife, \\"Forty-five hundred is enough to spend for any yearling.\\" Two years later in 1920, Riddle declined an offer of 400,000 for the horse. At maturity, Man o' War stood 16.2 1/2 hands (66.5 inches, 169 cm), with prominent withers and a high croup, but was sometimes faulted for a dipped back that grew more pronounced with age. He had virtually flawless legs and solid bone, traits he passed on to his offspring. He had a slightly Roman nose and notably high head carriage. His nickname was \\"Big Red\\", though his coat had tinges of yellow and gold. An energetic, spirited horse, he is often pictured standing very still and gazing off into the distance, described as the \\"look of eagles\\". His stride was measured at 28 feet, believed to be the longest of all time. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did it have famous parents?","response":"Yes, Man o' War did have famous parents. The text states that \\"Man o' War was sired by Fair Play, a multiple stakes winner who finished second in the 1908 Belmont Stakes to the undefeated Colin. Man o' War was the second foal out of Mahubah, a lightly raced mare by English Triple Crown Champion Rock Sand.\\" This indicates that both of his parents were notable within the horse racing world."},{"question":"Former U.S. Sen. Charles Percy, a prominent Illinois Republican who served in the Senate for nearly 20 years and became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, died Saturday, said a spokesman for Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a relative. He was 91. Percy, a one-time rising star in the Republican Party who was once considered a potential presidential candidate, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1966 and served until 1985. His daughter, Sharon, the wife of Rockefeller (D-West Virginia), spoke publicly in 2009 of her father experiencing Alzheimer's disease. She made those remarks before the National Alzheimer's Association. Born in Florida and raised in Chicago's far north neighborhood of Rogers Park and the well-to-do suburb of Winnetka, Percy was regarded a business wunderkind who rose to become the president, CEO and board chairman of Bell & Howell, a manufacturer of made home-movie cameras and electronic consumer products. He became president at age 29. He was appointed as President Dwight Eisenhower's personal representative to presidential inaugurations in Peru and Bolivia with the rank of special ambassador in 1956. After an unsuccessful run for governor of Illinois in 1964, he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate two years later. While campaigning in 1966, Percy's other daughter, Valerie, Sharon's twin, was murdered at age 21 in the family's Kenilworth, Illinois, home, a crime that shocked Illinois and the nation. The murder is unsolved, but remains a vivid memory for many residents of Chicago and Illinois who knew Percy. While in the Senate, Percy emerged as an antagonist to President Richard Nixon, also a Republican, when Percy called for a special prosecutor to investigate Watergate, the political scandal that eventually culminated in Nixon's resignation. Percy considered running for the 1976 presidential nomination, but he backed off after Nixon resigned in 1974 and after Vice President Gerald Ford became the new president and decided to seek the 1976 nomination himself. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Former U.S. Senator Charles Percy was a celebrated figure in Illinois and a key member of the Republican party who served in the Senate from 1966 to 1985.

Percy's political journey began with him taking on the role of President Dwight Eisenhower's personal representative to presidential inaugurations in Peru and Bolivia as a special ambassador in 1956. Before his political career, Percy, considered a business prodigy, was appointed president of Bell & Howell, a company manufacturing consumer electronic products and home-movie cameras, at the young age of 29. Born in Florida and brought up in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood and the affluent suburb of Winnetka, Percy demonstrated his exceptional skills and talents from an early age. His political journey wasn't without dramatic moments though. In 1964, Percy's first run for governor of Illinois ended unsuccessfully, but he learned from the experience and successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1966. However, his campaign was overshadowed by a tragedy that struck his family prematurely. Percy's 21-year-old daughter, Valerie, was murdered in their family home, a crime that remains unsolved. The incident shocked Illinois and the entire country, leaving a vivid memory in the minds of those who knew Percy. Despite the personal tragedy, Percy continued his political journey in the Senate. He made a significant stand against President Richard Nixon, a member of his own party, calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the Watergate scandal. This controversy played a significant role in Nixon's eventual resignation from presidential office. In 1974, after Nixon's resignation, Vice President Gerald Ford assumed presidency and Percy considered running for the 1976 Presidential nomination. However, when Ford decided to seek the nomination himself, Percy decided to hold off from further competitive political pursuits.

Possible A: tail, whiskers, two eyes, four paws, four legs Why is \\"four legs\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"Four legs\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to the primary appendages of a cat that are used for locomotion, standing, and support. While it's true that cats have other appendages like a tail, whiskers, two eyes, and four paws, these parts do not have the same primary function as the legs. The concept of \\"appendage\\" could be broadly interpreted to include any external body part that extends from the main body. However, the question specifically asks about the number of appendages, which suggests that the focus is on cat limbs. Human common sense dictates that when people think about the appendages of a quadrupedal animal like a cat, they would generally consider only the legs, rather than body parts such as eyes or whiskers, as the primary appendages. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the cat's legs enable it to perform various functions, such as walking, running, jumping, and climbing. In the context of this question, it's clear that \\"four legs\\" is the most relevant and appropriate answer, reflecting an understanding shared by many people of how cat anatomy is structured and which body parts can be considered appendages for locomotion and support."},{"question":"Q:What are the last names of the two agents who offer Drew a deal?

Typically, it involves four critical steps: (1) sentencing, (2) direct review, (3) state collateral review, and (4) federal habeas corpus. Recently, a narrow and final fifth level of process – (5) the Section 1983 challenge – has become increasingly important. (Clemency or pardon, through which the Governor or President of the jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence, is an executive rather than judicial process.) The number of new death sentences handed down peaked in 1995–1996 (309). There were 73 new death sentences handed down in 2014, the lowest number since 1973 (44).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"The power wielded by a Governor in the context of the death penalty in the United States is the ability to grant clemency or pardon. Clemency or pardon is an executive action through which the Governor or President of the jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence. This power is separate from the judicial process, as it is exercised by the executive branch of government. It provides an additional layer of protection and review for individuals sentenced to death, potentially allowing for a reduction in sentence or complete exoneration based on new evidence, changes in law, or other relevant factors related to the case."},{"question":"Q:Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

If you believe that only tough guys commit crimes, you may have to think again. Unlike in the movies, we can't divide the world into bad guys and model citizens. _ In the same way that diseases range from the common cold to fatal forms of cancer, crimes vary in degree. For example, smoking in an elevator will inconvenience people, but much less than threatening them with a gun. In addition to breaking the law themselves, people tolerate various levels of crime. Why can we tolerate some crimes? It may be that, by seeing others do something, we accept it more easily. For instance, most people will find it easier to speed on a highway when everybody else is driving over the speed limit. When people celebrate a sports championship, if they see someone breaking store windows, they might start breaking windows themselves or even steal from the store. So the people around us influence how much law-breaking we can tolerate. We must also wonder whether seeing violence on television or reading about it in the newspapers every day makes us tolerate crime more than we should. We become used to seeing blood on the news on television, or in full color in newspapers and magazines. Because we see thousands of dead people on TV, maybe we just try to ignore the situation behind the violence. If so many citizens tolerate violence and crime, or even commit crimes themselves, it may simply be because of the human mind. Our minds may not care about specific laws. Instead, our minds may have a system of values that usually prevents us from hurting other people to improve our own lives. Yet, when it comes to respecting the rights of a mass of anonymous individuals, we might not be so responsible. While most people would not steal a wallet containing 50, they may not mind cheating on taxes, because cheating on taxes does not hurt any one person.

Sarah Griffiths. Paleontologists have long pondered what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago and came up with some crazy theories. While a spy proposed the dinosaurs suffered from overactive glands and a low sex drive, which led to their downfall, other scientists believed growing too big, hungry caterpillars, aliens and a taste for eggs were all good reasons as to why the ancient beasts died out. Now-a-days most scientists agree a combination of volcanic activity, climate change and a massive asteroid impact probably finished off land-dwelling dinosaurs - with the exception of birds. While a spy proposed the dinosaurs suffered from overactive glands and a low sex drive which led to their downfall, other scientists believed growing too big, hungry caterpillars, aliens and even farting were all good reasons as to why the ancient beasts died out. A spy and Hungarian-born aristocrat, Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás, had plenty of extinction theories in the early 20th century including that dinosaurs had a low sex drive and overactive glands. The keen paleontologist thought dinosaurs got so large because of secretions from the pituitary gland, which caused them to grow too large. While he tried to apply knowledge of human conditions to the dinosaurs, there is no evidence to suggest that the gland had anything to do with the animals' size or extinction, Smithsonian reported. Another scientist living at the same time, called George Wieland, believed the dinosaurs ate themselves to death and the T-Rex got its 'first impulse toward gigantism on a diet of sauropod eggs'. The Yale researcher said the greedy carnivores ate too many eggs and caused their mass extinction, but now-a-days scientists agree that while fossils show the creatures had a taste for eggs, they could not have eaten them all. Staying with eggs, fossil expert H.K. Erben proposed in the 1970s that dinosaur eggs had multiple shell layers, while others were too thin, causing developing dinosaurs to either suffocate, or dehydrate if the shell was too thin and got broken. One researcher said greedy dinosaurs ate too many eggs to cause mass extinction, but now-a-days scientists agree that while fossils show the creatures had a taste for eggs, they could not have eaten them all. A nest of petrified dinosaur eggs being analysed is pictured. While he based his idea on eggshells found in Southern France, fossil records show this was a local phenomenon and not a widespread problem. In the early 1900s, when Darwin's theory of natural selection was still catching on, many palaeontologists thought the beasts became too sluggish, big and stupid to function. The now unpopular theory supposed that dinosaurs had a kind of evolutionary inertia and spent their energy getting larger instead of smarter, despite the fact that some of the largest species of dinosaur including the Stegosaurus and Brachiosaurus thrived. More recently, in the past decade, an infertility specialist has argued the dinosaurs died out as they couldn't find partners. Sherman Silber said that as temperatures can determine the sex of some animals, like crocodiles, climate change could have ensured that only one sex of dinosaur babies were born. There are several holes in this theory including that scientists do not know if the sex of dinosaurs were determined by temperature. In the 1960s, entomologist Stanley Flanders proposed that the first moths and caterpillars ate all the vegetation on Cretaceous Earth, causing the herbivorous dinosaurs to go hungry. In the 1960s by entomologist Stanley Flanders proposed that the first moths, butterflies and caterpillars ate all the vegetation on Cretaceous Earth, causing the herbivorous dinosaurs to go hungry. A modern Pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly is pictured. Consequently he argued the predators would also starve as they had no more vegetarian dinosaurs to eat. However, once again, modern science and fossil records have shown that butterflies and moths happily coexisted with dinosaurs and did not gobble all the plants. The Smithsonian article notes that as the expertise of scientists often informs their theory, it is not surprising that ophthalmologist L.R. Croft believed bad eyesight was to blame for the extinction of the dinosaurs. In the 1980s he said rising temperatures caused cataracts to develop faster and even went as far to suggest that dinosaurs successfully evolved horns on their faces to protect their eyes from the sun. The theory does not explain why flying dinosaurs did not go blind too. While not strictly a scientific idea, last year paleontologist David Wilkinson speculated the dinosaur's annual. output of methane gas would have been enough to cause global warming. Before the idea of an asteroid impact (pictured) was embraced by the scientific community as a reason for the extinction of dinosaurs, physicist Wallace Tucker and paleontologist Dale Russell suggested in the 1970s that a death blow came from space. While they did not mention extinction, the media seized upon the idea to conclude dinosaurs farted themselves to death. Likewise, a TV programme last year called 'Ancient Aliens' amalgamated various scraps of science to state that aliens could have wiped out the dinosaurs. However, Utah State University’s Prehistoric Museum said there is no evidence to suggest this theory is true as no fossilized aliens, or alien waste has ever been discovered. Finally, before the idea of an asteroid impact was embraced by the scientific community as a reason for the extinction of dinosaurs, physicist Wallace Tucker and paleontologist Dale Russell suggested in the 1970s that a death blow came from space. However, they thought a supernova relatively close to the Earth exploded and bombarded the upper atmosphere with X-rays causing temperatures to decrease sharply. But no evidence of an astronomical event has been found.

Nowadays, most scientists believe that dinosaurs went extinct because of volcanic activity, climate change, and a big asteroid hitting the Earth.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","response":"To answer the question in a satisfactory fashion, we must also discuss advantages of light carriers over escort carriers. Here's a revised answer: Light carriers had several advantages over escort carriers: 1. Speed: Light carriers were faster than escort carriers, allowing them to keep up with the main fleet and respond more quickly to threats or changing conditions. 2. Aircraft capacity: Light carriers could carry more aircraft than escort carriers, providing a more substantial air wing for offensive and defensive operations. 3. Combat capabilities: Light carriers were typically more sturdily built and better equipped for combat situations, possessing better armor and more powerful defensive weaponry. 4. Operational range: Light carriers had a greater range of operations than escort carriers, enabling them to project power and support missions at a greater distance from their home bases. In comparison, escort carriers were usually converted from merchant ships or, in some cases, purpose-built as stop-gap measures to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions.

Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Hamden Khalif Allah Awad alias Ahmed the German ( actually Egyptian ) ( August 13 , 1970 -- August 7 , 1998 ) was one of the perpetrators of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania .

This higher demand for oxygen means that the delivery of a smaller amount of oxygen to the bloodstream would directly impact the efficiency of the overall process. The direct impact can be observed in these steps: - The oxygen passing through the bronchial tubes to the lungs: Because there is less oxygen being inhaled, it will directly affect the amount of oxygen available to pass through the bronchial tubes to the lungs. - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream: With a smaller amount of oxygen available, less oxygen will be moved into the bloodstream, directly impacting this step.

At the fair, paid in part by tax dollars, an announcer tried to whip the crowd up into a frenzy, asking who wanted to see President Obama 'run down by a bull'. The stunt on Saturday has raised fresh concerns about how ridiculing President Obama is nothing more than thinly veiled racism. Scroll down for video. Anger: A rodeo clown dressed as Obama has angered visitors to Missouri State Fair. One of the other rodeo clowns wobbled the lips of the Obama mask, and the man wearing it was forced to run after a bull gave chase, according to a man who witnessed the event. A couple who had taken a foreign exchange student to the fair to show them American life said they left in disgust after seeing the offensive stunt, according to the Kansas City Star. According to the paper, a Facebook post by Perry Beam said: 'The announcer wanted to know if anyone would like to see Obama run down by a bull. The crowd went wild.' He added that the announcer repeated the question, getting 'louder each time, whipping the audience into a lather'. Senator Claire McCaskill called the event shameful and unacceptable, according to CBS St Louis. 'The young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse - that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the President of our great nation,' Ms McCaskill said. The Jackson County Democratic Party also issued a statement that called the rodeo 'a show as ugly any you could see.' 'Encouraging physical harm to the President, whatever the party, is not acceptable and should not be tolerated,' the statement read. Anti-Obama sentiment is high in rural Missouri, where the President lost 60-40 per cent to Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. Outcry: Many people took to Twitter to condemn the rodeo act. However, the rodeo clown dressed as. Obama was considered by many to be a joke too far, especially. considering the fair, which sells itself as being suitable for people of. all ages, is said to have received about 400,000 from Missouri tax. payers. Jeff Mazur, executive director at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, was one of many people who took to social media to condemn the event. 'I like rodeos, I like funnel cake. I like the MO State Fair. Barely-veiled racism, anti-Americanism and violence fantasies ruin them,' he said on Twiiter. His comments were backed by several Republicans, including Jeremy LaFaver, who said he would no longer be taking his family to the state fair. St Louis treasurer Tishaura Jones tweeted on Sunday: 'Racism rears its ugly head at MO State Fair ... the fair needs to do a better job welcoming ALL Missourians.' According to CBS St Louis, she added: 'Since November 2008, racism has been masked under the guise of \\"anti-Obama sentiment\\".' State Republican Gail McCann Beatty said she was angered and disgusted by 'the blatant racism', adding: 'This is an embarrassment to the People of Missouri.' Caleb Rowden, another Republican, added on Twitter: 'I don’t agree w/ this Prez on. many things. But he is deserving of respect and shouldn’t be the object. of political stunts. Out of line!' Boycott: The stunt led to some families and politicians saying they will stop visiting the fair. Several people have taken to the state fair's Facebook page to state their disgust at the rodeo show, saying it was disrespectful and claiming they would boycott the fair next year. A spokesman for Missouri State Fair told Mail Online:. 'The performance by one of the rodeo clowns at Saturday’s event was. inappropriate and disrespectful, and does not reflect the opinions or. standards of the Missouri State Fair.' Kari Mergen added: 'We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday’s rodeo badly missed that mark.'

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

As the narrator mentioned, Mrinalini claimed to be a member of the magazine committee. This presented itself as useful and relevant information, as the narrator needed assistance in obtaining articles, presumably for the magazine they were working on. Since Mrinalini presented herself as an authoritative figure within the committee, offering \\"timely help\\" and valuable support to the narrator, the expectation was that her name would be listed as a committee member. However, when the narrator reviewed the committee list to verify her membership, they were taken aback to find her name absent from the roll call. This unexpected discovery could have evoked several thoughts and concerns. Firstly, the narrator may have started to question Mrinalini's credibility and authenticity, given that she claimed to be on the magazine committee but her name was not listed. They might have wondered whether Mrinalini was dishonest or deceptive with her claims, either for personal benefit or other unknown reasons. Secondly, the narrator might have been surprised because Mrinalini appeared to be knowledgeable and well-versed with the magazine committee’s work. Therefore, it seemed unusual for someone so involved and competent not to be listed as a member. Lastly, the narrator might have also considered the possibility of a clerical error. They might have thought that her name could have been accidentally left out of the list or that there may have been a mistake in the documentation. In conclusion, the narrator was surprised to not see Mrinalini's name in the committee list because it contradicted her claim of being a part of the magazine committee. This discrepancy caused the narrator to question her credibility, entertain the possibility of an error, and consider the reasons behind the situation. With Mrinalini providing significant assistance and displaying valuable expertise, the narrator found it hard to comprehend why she would not be officially recognized as a member of the magazine committee."},{"question":"Write the answer: Which 1993 novel by Sebastian Faulks is set during the First World War?","response":"To provide the answer, I will perform the following steps: 1.

To begin, let us first explain each step of the process you have mentioned and then discuss the relationship between oxygen intake, glucose breakdown, and carbon dioxide production. 1. A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth: Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nostrils during inhalation. This oxygen-rich air then travels through the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, until it reaches the alveoli, which are small sacs in the lungs specialized for gas exchange. 2. The oxygen travels into the body: Once in the alveoli, oxygen diffuses across the alveolar and capillary membranes, entering the bloodstream where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 3. Breaks down into glucose: This step may be a bit confusing, as the breakdown of glucose, not oxygen, is the main process in cellular respiration. Oxygen is essential for the breakdown of glucose in cells, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process occurs in the mitochondria and is known as aerobic respiration. It involves a series of metabolic reactions, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, which all contribute to the production of ATP. 4. Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown: During the breakdown of glucose, carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated as a waste byproduct. CO₂ also needs to be transported out of the cell and into the bloodstream, where it eventually diffuses into the alveoli. 5. The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth: Once carbon dioxide reaches the alveoli, it diffuses back across the alveolar and capillary membranes for exhalation, removing it from the body. Now, let's consider the hypothetical situation where more oxygen is inhaled and its effect on the production of carbon dioxide. In general, breathing in more oxygen would not necessarily result in a direct increase in the amount of carbon dioxide produced or ATP generation. The amount of glucose breakdown and subsequent energy production depends on various factors, including bodily needs (e.g., during physical activity, resting, etc.), and the availability of substrates like glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to fuel these processes. Unless there is an increase in metabolic demand for energy production, inhaling more oxygen would not necessarily accelerate the rate of glucose breakdown and consequently the production of carbon dioxide. However, if the body does require more energy, either due to higher physical or metabolic activity, and increased oxygen intake is available accordingly, then the rate of glucose breakdown may increase in response. This, in turn, would lead to higher carbon dioxide production as a waste byproduct during this process. In such cases, the relationship between oxygen intake and carbon dioxide production would follow option A: more. It is also essential to consider that breathing in more oxygen than required (i.e., hyperventilation) may disturb the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body and create other complications. The body's respiratory system is designed to match oxygen consumption with carbon dioxide production to maintain an optimal balance for the proper functioning of cells and tissues. In conclusion, the relationship between oxygen intake and carbon dioxide production depends on the activity level and other factors related to the energy demands of the body. In situations where energy demands are increased, and more oxygen is available, carbon dioxide production may also increase. However, in a resting state or without an increase in metabolic demand, additional oxygen intake does not necessarily lead to more carbon dioxide production."},{"question":"Grant Hurcomb was raising funds for Cancer Research UK and MND Scotland.

Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie.

Two friends, Alice and Bob, decide to come here to chat and catch up after not seeing each other for months. Alice is a passionate artist and Bob is an aspiring scientist. They discover that their interests have led them down very different paths, even though they share the same love for exploring the world around them. Alice: (Walks in and spots Bob) Bob! Hey there! It's been ages! How are you? Bob: Alice! It's so good to see you! I'm doing great, thanks. How about you? Alice: I'm doing pretty well myself, thanks for asking. So, what have you been up to all this time? **Scene 2**: Alice and Bob choose a table by the window. The sun's rays illuminate the café and give it a warm, welcoming feel. They order coffee and a few pastries before diving into their conversation. Bob: I've actually taken up working in a lab, working on some groundbreaking research in particle physics. Just trying to unlock the secrets of the universe, you know? How about you? Alice: That's amazing, Bob! Well, I've been exploring my creative side — I've become an artist. I work with watercolors and oil paints mostly. I find art so liberating. Bob: Wow, that sounds like a beautiful way to connect with yourself and the world. But, isn't it hard to make a living as an artist? Alice: Yes, it can be. But I've been fortunate enough to participate in a few art events and sell my work online as well. I'm making a modest living, but the joy and satisfaction I get from creating make it all worth it. **Scene 3**: As Alice and Bob continue their conversation, an intriguing topic comes to light. Bob starts pondering the relationship between science and art. Bob: You know, Alice, I've always found it fascinating how our interests are so different and yet, at their core, they're both fueled by our curiosity and desire to explore. Alice: Absolutely, Bob! I often think about how art and science are like two sides of the same coin. They're both trying to unravel the mysteries of the world around us, but in distinct ways. Bob: That's true. But sometimes I feel like science is all about proving things with logic and facts, whereas art relies more on intuition and emotions. Surely there's some disconnect there, right? Alice: I see where you're coming from, but I believe that they actually complement each other. Art can provide science with new perspectives and insights, while science can give art a solid foundation to build upon. **Scene 4**: As the conversation continues, the café begins to fill up with patrons, but Alice and Bob remain focused on their discussion. Bob: So, do you think there's room for collaboration between artists and scientists? Alice: Definitely! Collaborative work can lead to the merging of artistic creativity and scientific knowledge. This could result in amazing innovations and discoveries that may have been unimaginable before. Bob: That's a fascinating point. I guess it's an untapped area that we should really start considering more seriously. Alice: I couldn't agree more. This very conversation between you, the scientist, and me, the artist, is proof that we can come together and learn from each other. **Scene 5**: The sun begins to set, and Alice and Bob realize they've spent hours discussing their different views on art, science, and the world around them. With a sense of newfound understanding, they decide that it's time to leave the café. Bob: Alice, this has been one of the most captivating conversations I've had in a long time! Why don't we plan another get-together soon? Alice: I'd love that, Bob! Today has truly been an eye-opening experience for me. I'm excited to see what our next meeting brings. Bob: Great! Let's keep in touch. Take care and see you soon! (Waves goodbye) Alice: You too, Bob! Farewell!

However, I soon found myself sinking deeper into the abyss of boredom and regret, as this latest debacle from director John Catastrophe seemed determined to undermine the very essence of compelling storytelling. The plot, if one could even call it that, meanders like a listless teenager in a shopping mall — without purpose, direction or any remote interest in a satisfying destination. It attempts to capture the essence of a dystopian future, where society is on the brink of collapse, but fails miserably in conveying any meaningful or coherent message. The characters portrayed in the movie are as flat as a piece of cardboard left out in the sun, rendering any emotional struggle or development completely meaningless and inconsequential. The acting, led by our protagonist Sarah Simper (played by the usually charismatic Jane Monotone), leaves much to be desired. Monotone's performance is as lifeless as the film’s title suggests, with awkward line deliveries, and her on-screen relationships with the other characters move forward at a glacial pace. The supporting cast fares no better, as they seem to have been given conflicting directions, leaving their performances feeling disjointed and incoherent. The dialogue is so drenched with clichés and heavy-handed exposition that it's difficult to decipher whether the screenwriter was being intentionally ironic or woefully naïve. Either way, it adds another layer of unpalatability to this cinematic train wreck. The predictable plot twists are made worse by the fact that they’re telegraphed from a mile away, leaving the audience wholly uninvested and impatient for the inevitable ending. The cinematography is another colossal letdown. Each frame appears to be crafted with utmost care to ensure that the shot is as lifeless and uninteresting as humanly possible. The color palette is nauseatingly dull, further sapping the energy out of any scene that had the potential to momentarily engage the viewer. Desolate landscapes and industrial interiors abound, though the repetitiveness quickly loses its visual impact, rendering the settings monotonous. Director John Catastrophe, who has a history of creating polarizing films, has clearly outdone himself this time. The pacing is unbelievably slow, making this film feel more like an endurance test than entertainment. Scenes drag on for minutes, adding nothing substantial to the story or character development. It's almost as though Catastrophe is challenging his audience to keep watching as the clock ticks away in perpetual agony. The film's only redeeming quality is its enthralling score, composed by the talented Fiona Resonance. Unfortunately, her stirring melodies are wasted and do little to salvage this sinking masterpiece of mediocrity. In conclusion, \\"Insufferably Tedious\\" is a deeply disappointing cinematic experience that fails to live up to its potential. The audience is left with an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction, frustration, and the precious lost hours they just spent in the theater. Steer clear of this cinematic black hole, and instead, opt for any alternative that promises a semblance of engagement and emotion."},{"question":"Trivia question: Which international relief agency, formed in 1863, has it's headquarters at 17, Avenue de la Paix, Geneva?

The idea of being able to report local issues like potholes, broken streetlights, and other problems directly to the council seems like a game-changer. However, there are a few issues with the app that prevent me from giving it a higher rating. Firstly, the user interface could use a good redesign. The navigation can be a bit confusing at times, and the overall look seems a bit outdated. Step-by-step guidance on how to report an issue to the council is needed to help users avoid any unnecessary confusion. A more modern and simplified interface would make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing. Secondly, the app can be a bit slow to load information, especially while using location services to find nearby issues. In the age of fast internet and instant gratification, users are more likely to give up on an app that doesn't provide quick results. Optimizing the app's performance would make the user experience much smoother. Lastly, there is a noticeable lack of communication from the council regarding the status of reported issues. An update system, where users receive notifications about the progress of their reports, would be a great addition to the app, giving users a sense of accomplishment and confidence in the app's impact. In conclusion, the org.mysociety.FixMyStreet app is a useful tool that empowers citizens to report and fix issues in their local communities. However, some improvements are needed to make it more user-friendly, fast, and efficient. Right now, I would rate the app three stars out of five, but I believe it has the potential to reach five stars with these suggested enhancements."},{"question":"Question: \\"What might underlie the Buddhist religious views?\\" Context: \\"The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought. These four truths explain the nature of dukkha (suffering, anxiety, unsatisfactoriness), its causes, and how it can be overcome. The four truths are:[note 4]\\" Answer:","response":"Buddhist religious views are centered on the fundamental understanding of human existence and the ultimate goal of transcending the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara) to reach a state of complete spiritual liberation (nirvana). These views are deeply rooted in the philosophical teachings of the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, who lived and taught in ancient India around 2500 years ago. The underlying core of Buddhist religious views can be traced to various central concepts and principles that give shape to the multitude of traditions and practices followed across diverse cultures and communities throughout the world. 1. The Four Noble Truths: As mentioned in the context, these serve as the foundation of Buddhist thought and provide a thorough understanding of the human condition and path to enlightenment. The Four Noble Truths are: a) The truth of dukkha: All living beings are subject to suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence in their lives. It is an inherent part of the human experience. b) The truth of the origin of dukkha: Suffering arises from craving, desire, and attachment to material objects, people, and experiences. c) The truth of the cessation of dukkha: Suffering can be ended by letting go of cravings, attachments, and ignorance, paving the way for the attainment of enlightenment and inner peace. d) The truth of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha: By following the Eightfold Path, one can achieve spiritual liberation from the cycles of samsara and attain nirvana. 2. The Eightfold Path: This forms the fourth Noble Truth and outlines the path toward enlightenment and the cessation of suffering. The Eightfold Path consists of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. By practicing these principles, one can cultivate wholesome mental states, ethical behavior, and a deep understanding of the true nature of reality. 3. The Three Marks of Existence: The central aspects of reality in the Buddhist world view are impermanence (anicca), suffering or unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anatta). Understanding these three fundamental characteristics of existence is crucial in helping individuals let go of their attachments, break free from the cycle of samsara, and attain spiritual liberation. 4. The Law of Karma: Karma, or the law of cause and effect, posits that intentional actions lead to consequences that influence the circumstances of one's life and future rebirths. By recognizing this interconnectivity, Buddhism encourages individuals to engage in wholesome and compassionate actions, which in turn contribute to their spiritual development and progress towards enlightenment. 5. The Five Precepts: These are the ethical guidelines of Buddhism that help shape a person's moral conduct and spiritual growth. They form the basic code of conduct to be observed by all practicing Buddhists and are closely linked to the principles of the Eightfold Path. The Five Precepts are: refraining from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxication. 6. The Bodhisattva Ideal: In Mahayana Buddhism, the goal of spiritual practice is not only to attain personal enlightenment, but also to help all sentient beings achieve liberation from suffering. This altruistic doctrine encourages practitioners to strive for spiritual development while providing support and compassion to others on their journey, ultimately working towards the collective awakening of all. In conclusion, the underlying Buddhist religious views are grounded in a profound understanding of the human condition, the intricacies of existence, and the interconnectedness of all beings. By incorporating the core principles and teachings, such as the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the Three Marks of Existence, individuals can work towards achieving inner peace, spiritual liberation, and ultimately contribute to the well-being of others in the process. These insights form the backbone of the Buddhist philosophical tradition, providing guidance for countless followers across global cultures and generations."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair.

Context: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: How does the author suggest that one can save money? Options: A. by decluttering your home B. not enough information C. by recycling items you already own D. by accepting used items from a friend or a relative A:","response":"D. by accepting used items from a friend or a relative"},{"question":"Article: President Obama has ordered a top-to-bottom review of how the U.S. government tries to win the release of Americans held hostage by terrorist groups overseas, The Daily Beast has learned. The review, which will include a specific emphasis on how the U.S. treats hostages’ family members, follows criticism that current hostage-negotiation operations are plagued by bureaucratic infighting and a lack of leadership, particularly by the White House. The review was prompted “as a result of the increased frequency of hostage-taking of Americans overseas,” Christine Wormuth, the undersecretary of Defense for policy and one of the Pentagon’s most senior officials, informed Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) in a letter last week (PDF). Hunter sits on the House Armed Services Committee and has been pressing the administration to do more to free Americans held by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Wormuth said the president had ordered the review “recently,” but she didn’t specify when. On Sunday, ISIS released its latest video showing the beheading of one of its American captives, Peter Kassig. The group is holding one more American, a 26-year-old woman who was kidnapped in Syria last year while delivering aid to Syrians affected by the country’s civil war. The brutal series of beheading videos has been a persistent reminder that the U.S. faces an implacable enemy, even as it steps up airstrikes on ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq. President Obama took heat for playing a round of golf on Martha’s Vineyard after the first video showing the beheading of journalist James Foley aired in August. Wormuth said the review will include a “specific emphasis on examining family engagement, intelligence collection, and diplomatic engagement policies.” The emphasis on the families of hostages is particularly noteworthy; the parents of Americans murdered by ISIS have criticized the White House for threatening them with potential criminal prosecution if they were to pay a ransom. Family members have also complained that the administration didn’t follow up on leads that they provided about where ISIS might be holding the Americans. Several groups of parents have banded together in efforts to locate their children but say they’ve run up against a wall at the White House. Foley’s parents reportedly told Obama in a phone call after their son was shown murdered that the government had “failed” him by not trying harder to win his freedom. It was during that phone call that Obama told the Foleys an earlier mission by the military had failed to extract the hostages from Syria. While not overtly acknowledging the complaints of family members and critics of the U.S. bureaucracy, Wormuth said the review would seek to “improve interagency coordination and strengthen the whole of government approach,” code for putting a stop to turf wars and getting the various corners of the government on the same page. Recent efforts to free ISIS prisoners have put the White House and the State Department at odds with the FBI, which has long sought more creative ways for getting Americans out of terrorists’ clutches, including facilitating ransom payments. Wormuth replied to Hunter after an earlier letter in which he urged the president to put someone in charge of all the government’s efforts to free Americans. In the letter, sent after the video of Foley’s beheading appeared, Hunter said he was “very concerned” that the government is not “adequately pursuing and exhausting opportunities” to bring Americans home. “The administration’s goal has always been to use every appropriate resource within the bounds of the law to assist families to bring their loved ones home. In light of the increasing number of U.S. citizens taken hostage by terrorist groups overseas and the extraordinary nature of recent hostage cases, this summer President Obama directed relevant departments and agencies, including the Departments of Defense and State, the FBI, and the intelligence community, to conduct a comprehensive review of how the U.S. government addresses these matters,” said Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the National Security Council. “While we are not in a position to detail every effort or every tool we are using to try to bring American hostages home, we will continue to bring all appropriate military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic capabilities to bear to recover American hostages. Those efforts continue every day.” ||||| WASHINGTON—The Obama administration is undertaking a review of how it handles cases of U.S. citizens held captive by extremists abroad, according to a letter from a top Pentagon official made public Monday, a move that follows criticism from some relatives of slain Americans. The review, according to the Pentagon letter, is designed to improve interagency coordination in hostage cases and will examine intelligence-collection efforts... |||||Summary:","response":"President Obama has asked for a complete check of how the U.S. government tries to free Americans who are captured by bad people in other countries. This is because some people have said that the current ways of talking to get the hostages free have problems and lack direction. This became important because more Americans are being captured in other countries. President Obama wants to focus on how the U.S. helps the families of these hostages too. For instance, the families who have lost their loved ones to a really bad group called ISIS have said that the U.S. government didn't help them enough when they tried to find and free their children. President Obama wants all parts of the government to work together better to free Americans who are captured."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

To isolate 'v', we need to move the constant term (-441) to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 441 to both sides. -147*v = 441. Step 3: Solve for 'v'. Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -147, to get 'v' by itself. v = 441 / -147. Step 4: Simplify the fraction. The numerator and the denominator have a common divisor of 3. v = (441/3) / (-147/3). v = 147 / -49. Step 5: Simplify further. Both 147 and 49 have a common divisor of 7. v = (147/7) / (-49/7). v = 21 / -7. Step 6: Calculate the final value. v = -3.

Her debut solo album She's So Unusual (1983) Context: Lauper was born at Boulevard Hospital in Astoria, Queens, New York City, to a Catholic family. Her father, Fred, was of German and Swiss descent. Her mother, Catrine (nee Gallo), is Italian American (from Sicily). Lauper's siblings are younger brother Fred (nicknamed Butch), and older sister, Ellen. Lauper's parents divorced when she was five. Her mother remarried and divorced again. Lauper grew up in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens and, as a child, listened to such artists as The Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. At age 12, she began writing songs and playing an acoustic guitar given to her by her sister. Lauper expressed herself with a variety of hair colors, eccentric clothing and even took a friend's advice to spell her name as \\"Cyndi\\" rather than \\"Cindy\\". Lauper went to Richmond Hill High School, but was expelled, although she later earned her GED. She left home at 17, to escape her abusive stepfather, intending to study art. Her journey took her to Canada, where she spent two weeks in the woods with her dog Sparkle, trying to find herself. She eventually traveled to Vermont, where she took art classes at Johnson State College and supported herself working odd jobs. In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as Janis Joplin. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing covers. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing. She was told by doctors that she would never sing again, but regained her voice with the help of vocal coach Katie Agresta. Question: What music did she like as a young adult?

The reviewer even draws a comparison to another film, \\"Daredevil,\\" which they perceive to have similarly disappointing qualities. The only somewhat positive remark is directed toward Liev Schreiber's performance as Sabretooth, although, even this performance wasn't enough to outweigh the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction with the film. Therefore, the sentiment behind this review is decisively negative."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Does the job.\\" Answer:","response":"To determine the star-rating of the review \\"Does the job,\\" one must first consider the possible rating options and what they generally represent: 1. ★ (1-star) - Extremely dissatisfied 2. ★★ (2-stars) - Somewhat dissatisfied 3. ★★★ (3-stars) - Neutral or average 4. ★★★★ (4-stars) - Satisfied 5. ★★★★★ (5-stars) - Extremely satisfied Now, let's analyze the content of the review: The phrase \\"Does the job.\\" suggests that the product or service met the reviewer's basic expectations but does not provide any specific praise or criticism.

If your Life Path reveals the road on which you walk, the Expression Number reveals the flavor and character of your steps. Considered from the perspective of reincarnation, your Life Path Number is akin to the lesson you must learn this lifetime. Connected to this, your Expression Number reflects the core being - including your personal history from any past lifetimes - that you brought with you to Earth. The name is used because it represents the inborn character of the self as well as that which was passed down to you at birth. Similar to calculating your Life Path Number, we reduce the number values of each name individually before combining the results. This honors the individual character your name's (and self's) different facets before uncovering their combined meaning. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z As an example, we'll take the name Robert Nesta Marley.

A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London, Ontario, in the wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing \\"the idea of men giving up their arms.\\" Commemorative demonstrations are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built. The Place du 6-Décembre-1989 in the Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation Nef pour quatorze reines (Nave for Fourteen Queens) by Rose-Marie Goulet. It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6.A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to \\"all women murdered by men\\", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers.

The approach to explaining this involves understanding the context of each sentence and looking at the different meanings of the word 'beat'. The first step involves looking at the context of the first sentence - \\"Beat the subway fare\\". In this sentence, the verb 'beat' is used in a different context. Here, it generally means to avoid or get around something - in this case, the subway fare. It implies that an individual is trying to evade paying the subway fare, perhaps by sneaking in or exploiting some sort of loophole. Next, let's consider the context of the second sentence - \\"Beat the table with his shoe\\". The verb 'beat' in this sentence has an entirely different context. Here, it implies physically striking or hitting the table with his shoe. It's a literal action of hitting or slamming. Thus, although 'beat' is used in both sentences, based on context it is clear that it conveys a different meaning in each - in the first sentence it means to get around or avoid, whereas in the second it means to physically hit. Context is key in understanding the true sense in which words are used.

President Obama is in a situation right now somewhat akin to that facing the creatures that once prowled the edges of the La Brea tar pits — a sticky trap that caught and consumed the least wary or agile members of many species. For Obama, the physical tar pit lies far away in northeastern Alberta province, Canada, but a rhetorical one surrounds him in Washington as the fight to shape his position on an oil pipeline draws toward a climax. He has a way out, but it’s a tricky path. Here’s the situation: Later this year Obama needs to decide if it is in the nation’s interest to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would be able to carry more than half a million barrels a day of a tarry oil precursor from Saudi-scale deposits in Alberta to American fuel refineries. (The administration’s approval is required because the pipeline crosses an international border.) There are signs that, despite impassioned opposition by environmentalists who were once important Obama allies, he will give the project the green light. Passion isn’t matched by response, in part, because environmental concerns cannot compete as an issue with persistent economic stagnation and joblessness. The most recent evidence was the White House decision Friday to hold off on tightening standards for air pollutants that form smog. The most visible protest on the pipeline plan has been a weeks-long demonstration outside the White House that culminated on Saturday. In the action, more than 1,200 campaigners, scientists (including NASA’s Jim Hansen), students and other concerned citizens — mainly brought there by the project’s climate impacts — sat down and waited for handcuffs: You can read reams of valuable context on the issues surrounding the Alberta resource and the pipeline in Foreign Policy (a particularly illuminating new tour of North American energy prospects by Charles Homans) The Times, The New Yorker, The Economist and more reams of blog and editorial commentary. (The Times editorial board has repeatedly criticized the pipeline plan.) I also encourage you to read analysis by the Canadian economist Andrew Leach for help in distinguishing hype from fact. My views are close to those of Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, who’s been providing analysis of the climate, security and economic issues since 2009 and who leans toward Obama approving the pipeline while pursuing energy and climate policies that would, in the end, render it insignificant and uneconomical. For me the pipeline, in isolation, is not in the national interest if we have any interest in not contributing, through our driving habits, to the despoliation of far-flung parts of the planet. This method of extracting petroleum leaves an unholy mess, even as conveyed by a libertarian writer like Ronald Bailey visiting the Alberta oil-sands mines on a junket paid for by oil companies. Consider his recent description of the vast amounts of residual material that persist for decades: Mature fine tailings are the big problem for oil sands extraction. They consist of a gel-like suspension of very fine clay, which for chemical reasons refuses to solidify in less than 30 years. Consequently, oil sands mines are surrounded by vast tailings ponds…. The ponds shimmer with a oily sheen since not all bitumen can be extracted from the sand. But that’s my stance on the project outside of broader contexts. Overall, I think Obama should not stand in the way of the pipeline. While it’s a potent symbol and convenient rallying point for campaigners, it’s a distraction from core issues and opportunities on energy and largely insignificant if your concern is averting a disruptive buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The pipeline plan doesn’t exist in isolation. With the economy in its own tar pit and a presidential election approaching, it’s very much in the national interest for Obama to avoid saddling himself with an unnecessary issue that would be easy for his foes to distort into an Obama anti-jobs position. This particular pipeline has a good chance of dying on the vine in any case if and when easier, less expensive sources of transportation fuel come online, including domestic oil and natural gas (and there are competing pipeline options and routes). The greenhouse impact of the oil sands is also far less significant than some claims, particularly given the reality that oil consumption rates are what matters — not the amount of gigatons of carbon sitting in deposits of this sort in the ground. Environmentalists’ statements about the massive greenhouse impact from oil-sand carbon don’t mention that it would take a millennium or more, even at a breath-taking rate of extraction of, say, 5 million barrels a day, for that CO2 impact to be fully realized (as if no new energy options, or methods for sopping up CO2, will arise in the future), as pointed out by Andrew Leach last June: In the fight against climate change, every bit counts, but to make an argument that is based on a leverage ratio of somewhere between 90 and 500 times the actual damage caused by a particular project is not the right way to go about it…. [I]f you want deep cuts to [greenhouse gas] emissions, you need a broad-based policy, not a hopelessly leveraged argument against a single project. In my opinion, those are the arguments most likely to be ignored as alarmist. I think that Americans are eager for a serious American energy policy that could both erode the economics of this pipeline and marginalize the “drill baby drill” crowd as childish and irresponsible. If Obama cast all of this the right way, such a policy would incorporate the need for more domestic energy exploration and development (done responsibly) with a long-term plan that also stresses conservation, efficiency and innovation. These same issues arose when Obama faced the BP gusher in the Gulf. Read my 2010 post on “Obama’s Oil and Energy Opportunity” to get my view of a sustainable policy path. In an interview taped earlier this summer, I discussed some of the core issues related to oil sands on The Agenda, the Canadian public affairs program. The interview ran last week as part of a five-day package focused on global energy issues and opportunities: In a post on Friday, Michael Levi wrote of the limited significance of the Keystone XL pipeline and the primacy of policies that curb demand for oil: Slash oil demand and oil sands development goes away; keep oil demand on its current trajectory and we’ve got huge climate problems regardless of whether Keystone XL is approved. I agree completely. Levi, who has exposed overstatements on both sides of the polarized debate, sees the pipeline as meriting approval mainly because its impact on climate — whether approved or denied — would be minimal when placed in global context. Levi and I discussed the pipeline on Friday via Skype. Here are some highlights: One of his points in our chat was that a reduction in demand kills the economics that make such marginal and expensive sources of fuel remotely feasible: The goal of climate policy should be to reduce demand for fossil fuels and if we do that the oil sands will become superfluous. In an e-mail before our exchange, I asked him the core question facing Obama: Is the pipeline in the national interest. Here’s Levi’s reply: I’ve been studiously avoiding coming down one way or the other on the national interest issue, in part because I’m pretty ambivalent, but I guess it’s time to get off the fence. I think that approval is ultimately in the U.S. national interest, so long as U.S. regulators ensure that the pipeline is operated safely. I do not buy the argument that the pipeline would be a massive windfall for U.S. security. I also think that climate change needs to be taken seriously. That said, reducing emissions by blocking the pipeline would likely be far more costly (primarily in terms of higher world oil prices but also, potentially, in terms of reduced Bakken production) than almost any other emissions-cutting approach that serious people contemplate. Let’s focus on those other approaches. (Targeting oil sands production also has very limited potential, since total oil sands production emissions are a tiny fraction of total U.S. emissions.) There is no realistic scenario where the oil sands are the difference between success and failure in addressing climate change. [ACR: I added the Bakken link for context.] I recognize that Bill McKibben, Jim Hansen and others see this particular project as crossing their moral line in the (tar) sand. I respect their decision to pursue civil disobedience. But I haven’t joined them because — while I would love to see America and the world cut oil appetites – I see more promising routes to meaningful progress on that front. And once the appetite is cut, there is less pressure to push the limits of oil extraction, both toward dirty, hard-to-extract deposits like Alberta’s, the deep-sea bed, the Arctic and elsewhere. I also think Bryan Walsh and Michael Grunwald at Time Magazine are right in pointing out the perils that could come if environmental groups keep beating up on Obama. As Walsh wrote a week ago: If greens want to sit out the election and help a President Rick Perry or a President Michele Bachmann become a reality, go ahead. It might even feel good. But the consequences would be far, far, far worse than any single pipeline. In the meantime, the Tar Sands Action organizers are poised to announce phase two of their movement.","response":"President Obama faces a critical decision on whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport over half a million barrels of oil per day from deposits in Alberta, Canada, to American fuel refineries.

This monumental event marked a significant milestone for women's hockey and the promotion of gender equality in sports. The journey toward including women's hockey in the Olympics began much earlier, though. Women's ice hockey has been played since the early 20th century, with the first recorded women's game taking place in 1921 in Ottawa, Canada. Over the years, the popularity of women's hockey grew as various leagues and championships were established across different countries, particularly in North America and Europe. In the late 1980s, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made a conscious effort to promote gender equality in Olympic sports and began considering the inclusion of women's ice hockey in the Winter Olympic program. In 1991, the proposal to include women's ice hockey as a medal event finally gained enough support to go through, making its debut in the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of a new era for women's hockey as six teams competed for the inaugural gold medal. The participating countries were the United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, China, and Japan. The tournament was played in a round-robin format, followed by a knockout stage to determine the medal winners. The United States claimed the first gold medal in women's Olympic hockey by defeating Canada in the final, and Finland won the bronze medal by beating China. Since then, women's hockey has remained a fixture at the Winter Olympics, attracting increased attention and competitiveness. The number of participating teams expanded to eight in the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, ensuring more opportunities for female hockey players from various countries to compete on the world stage. The inclusion of women's hockey in the Olympics has not only raised the global profile of the sport but has also led to increased participation and development within the women's hockey community. With dedicated athletes, burgeoning leagues, and growing fan bases, women's hockey continues to flourish and break barriers, inspiring future generations of female athletes to pursue their dreams and excel in the sport they love."},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: ATRIUMactedasfinancialadvisortotheIcelandicArdegiandtwoIcelandicco-investorsintheconsortium’sacquisitionofMerlinfromFDB.","response":"Sure, here it is with spaces added for easier reading: Atrium acted as financial advisor to the Icelandic Ardegi and two Icelandic co-investors in the consortium's acquisition of Merlin from FDB."},{"question":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: Where does Mason and Axels fight take place? billiard room Answer:","response":"Title: \\"Racked and Ready\\" Genre: Action/Comedy Plot Summary: Mason and Axel, two small-time hustlers, spend their nights in the underground billiard bars of Shoreview City, competing in high-stakes games of pool and forging a strong, brotherly bond.

Spoiler of sorts follows. Poor Cedric; he apparently didn't know what hit him. Poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.

Milo observed that his oar heated up more when rowing through choppy water compared to calm water. The additional heat generated is due to increased friction and resistance caused by the turbulent and irregular movement of water in choppy conditions.

Abrams, meanwhile, tends toward a cinematographic trope that looks, at first glance, like a screw-up -- lens flare -- i.e. intentionally flooding the camera frame with light to deliberately wash out or obscure the imagery on-screen. His 2011 sci-fi thriller “Super 8” is packed with hazy flashes of light, as is the filmmaker’s 2009 “Star Trek” movie reboot. But what was once the cinematic equivalent of a nervous tic has become a full-blown body tremor. And critics say the director needs a lens flare intervention. Abrams’ presumed summer blockbuster “Star Trek Into Darkness,” which arrives in theaters May 17, features so much hazy blue light bombarding the starship Enterprise's flight deck that audience members would be forgiven for mistaking the lens flares (rendered even more vivid in 3-D) for incoming photon torpedoes. With the movie opening earlier this month across Europe, Asia and Australia, early reviewers, most of whom like the movie, nevertheless have taken the director to task for showcasing so many diffuse bursts of light rather than leaving them on the editing bay floor where they say they belong. “In ‘Star Trek Into Darkness,’ [Abrams] does his best to ensure gratuitous use of lens flare will live long and prosper,” Luke Buckmaster wrote on Crikey, an Australian media blog. “Only the most ambitious film critics profess to interpret why he does this, other than to observe that the effect looks kind of cool.” In the Guardian UK, critic Andrew Pulver puts the convention within context of a notorious music video vixen, noting that “ ‘Into Darkness’ is slathered in so much lens flare it looks like a Kylie Minogue video.” In his “Into Darkness” review, Shadowlocked.com’s Lewis Bazley seems to resign himself to Abrams’ continuing abuse of the light flare treatment. “… if you tease [Abrams] for his love of lens flare, he’ll just double his efforts to obscure some of every shot with refracted light,” Bazley writes. Abrams’ over-reliance on lens flare prompted the wags at Boy Genius Comedy to lampoon the director with a short called “Lens Flare: The Movie” featuring a group of young people who fear alien invasion but are rendered too blind by lens flash trickery to do anything about it. For his part, at a 2009 news conference for “Star Trek,\\" Abrams admitted having his cinematographer employ flashlights and mirrors to achieve lens flare -- and getting a little carried away with the visual technique. “I wanted a visual system that felt unique,” the filmmaker said. “I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think, ‘Oh that’s ridiculous, that was too many.’ But I love the idea that the future was so bright it couldn’t be contained in the frame.” L.A.

In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik.

It's based on a taped interview of Georges Remi a.k.a. Herge, Tintin's creator, from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own series of comic books. Awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herge's dreams. I first encountered Tintin in the pages of Children's Digest at my local elementary school library reading The Secrets of the Unicorn. My mom later got a subscription to CD and I read the entire Red Rackham's Treasure every month in 1978. I remember seeing some Tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason I didn't get any probably because I was 12 and I thought I was outgrowing them. I do have Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. Haven't read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ (whom he later married). Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this film is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07-I've now read Breaking Free. Tintin and The Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of Mr. Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for The Captain who he's staying with. The Captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly. They and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident. The whole thing takes place in England with working-class cockney accents intact. Not the kind of thing Herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless. Oh, yes, dog Snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover (which has Tintin running over the police!) and the dedication page. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","response":"The sentiment of this review appears to be generally positive. Here are the steps I followed to make this determination: 1. It starts with the excitement and reminiscing of the user about their past experiences with Tintin's stories, which evoke a nostalgic, positive tone.

It continues with the user mentioning obtaining the book \\"Breaking Free,\\" which holds a place in their collection yet to be read, indicating a level of interest and positivity towards Tintin's universe. 3.

After defeating the lord's enemies in battle, they return to Tsuzuki's castle. On their way through the thick forest surrounding the castle, they meet a spirit, who foretells their future. The spirit tells them that today Washizu will be named Lord of the Northern Garrison and Miki will now be commander of the first fortress. She then foretells that Washizu will eventually become Lord of Spiderweb Castle, and finally she tells Miki that his son will also become lord of the castle. When the two return to Tsuzuki's estate, he rewards them with exactly what the spirit had predicted. As Washizu discusses this with Asaji, his wife, she manipulates him into making the second part of the prophecy come true by killing Tsuzuki when he visits. Washizu kills him with the help of his wife, who gives drugged sake to the lord's guards, causing them to fall asleep. When Washizu returns in shock at his deed, Asaji grabs the bloody spear and puts it in the hands of one of the three unconscious guards. She then yells \\"murder\\" through the courtyard, and Washizu slays the guard before he has a chance to plead his innocence. Tsuzuki's vengeful son Kunimaru and an advisor to Tsuzuki (and rival of Washizu) named Noriyasu both suspect Washizu as the murderous traitor and try to warn Miki, who refuses to believe what they are saying about his friend. Washizu, though, is unsure of Miki's loyalty, but he wants to trust his friend and he still plans to let Miki's son be his heir, since he and Asaji have been unable to bear a child of their own. Washizu plans to tell Miki and his son about his decision at a grand banquet, but Asaji tells him that she is pregnant, which leaves him with a quandary concerning his heir, as now Miki's son has to be eliminated.

In this case, my task is to write a negative movie review for a fictional film titled \\"Disaster Flick.\\" Step 1: Begin with an opening statement. Justification: Starting with a strong statement captures the reader's attention and sets the tone for the review. Opening Statement: Every once in a while, a movie comes along that challenges our understanding of what we consider \\"bad,\\" and \\"Disaster Flick\\" does just that. It's a trainwreck of a movie that levels cinematic landmarks to rubble and leaves nothing but mediocrity in its wake. Step 2: Introduce the movie's premise. Justification: Providing the premise of the movie informs readers about the story and helps support the upcoming criticisms. Premise Introduction: The film follows a handful of survivors navigating a post-apocalyptic world after a series of natural disasters wreak havoc on the planet. While the storyline had potential, it was squandered by weak character development and a severe lack of originality. Step 3: Critique acting performances. Justification: Assessing the acting performances is crucial, as it informs readers about the effectiveness of the actors in portraying their characters. Acting Critique: The performances in \\"Disaster Flick\\" fell flat. The poorly written dialogue and overacting exhibited by the main cast resulted in a disconnect between the audience and the characters. Despite featuring a star-studded lineup, their talents were wasted by the one-dimensional roles they were given. Step 4: Analyze the visual effects and cinematography. Justification: Highlighting the film's visual elements and cinematography helps paint a picture for the reader about the movie's presentation and style. Visual Effects and Cinematography Analysis: \\"Disaster Flick\\" relied heavily on CGI to depict the destruction, but the subpar visual effects only detracted from the viewing experience. The shaky camerawork and inconsistent lighting further contributed to a displeasing and disorienting experience for viewers. Step 5: Mention the film's pacing and script. Justification: Reviewing the pacing and script is essential, as a well-written script and good pacing can be crucial to a movie's success. Pacing and Script Critique: The pacing felt uneven and rushed, leading to an incoherent narrative that undermined any investment in the story. The plot which was filled with clichés and predictable twists and turns, rendered viewers uninterested and robbed the film of any potential excitement. Step 6: Give a closing statement. Justification: Wrapping up the review with a closing statement summarizes the author's opinion on the film and reinforces the criticisms expressed. Closing Statement: In conclusion, \\"Disaster Flick\\" is an unfortunate mess of missed opportunities and a disappointing experience that falls short in nearly every aspect of filmmaking. The film's lackluster production, unconvincing performances, and underwhelming storyline make it a disaster in its own right."},{"question":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Mike's favourite Avenger is the Black Panther.

Harrison: (smirking) Oh, that's easy - Black Panther, right? Mike: (impressed) You got it! T'Challa's intelligence, prowess, and leadership skills make him the best Avenger. Plus, he's the king of Wakanda - a highly advanced and technologically superior nation in Africa. How badass is that? Harrison: (nodding) Yeah, I agree that Black Panther has a lot going for him, and Wakanda is an incredible nation. But my favorite Avenger is still Captain America. Mike: (leaning against the shelf) Captain America? The super soldier with a vibranium shield? How come he's your favorite? Harrison: (smiling) It's because of Steve Rogers' character - his unfaltering moral compass, exceptional courage, and remarkable leadership skills. Plus, he's got a long history that dates back to World War II, giving him a rich narrative in the comics. Mike: (scratching his head) But, isn't Captain America a bit outdated? I mean, he was a product of the Super Soldier Serum experiment back in the '40s. And considering current science and technology, he seems a bit old school, don't you think? Harrison: (raising an eyebrow) Well, Mike, I think it's important to consider the values that people from that time embraced. They believed in the idea of duty, honor, and selflessness. Steve Rogers embodies those ideals, in a way serving as an inspiration for others. Besides, his experiences from WWII give him a unique perspective, enabling him to make wise decisions in the fight against evil. Mike: (crossing his arms) Alright, I get your point, but Black Panther brings more to the table. Think about it: he's a scientist with access to the most advanced technology on the planet. It's even said that the technology of Wakanda makes Tony Stark's look like child's play. Harrison: (grinning) Tony Stark would probably be offended, but it's true, Wakanda's technology is an asset to the Avengers. However, let's not forget Captain America's incredible tactical mind. That, along with his vast experience, makes him a vital strategist for the team. Mike: (putting his hands on his hips) Well, Black Panther is not just a strategist; he's a king. He knows how to make difficult decisions and stand up for what he believes in. I think that definitely gives T'Challa an edge. Harrison: (nodding) It's true, being a king comes with unique responsibilities and experiences. But we cannot ignore the fact that Steve Rogers has been leading the Avengers since their inception. His ability to unite a diverse group of superheroes cements his status as an excellent leader. Mike: (smirking) I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one, Harrison. Harrison: (smiling) Yeah, it seems so. No matter what though, both Black Panther and Captain America bring great strengths to the Avengers team. Mike: (laughing) Agreed.

To warrant a higher rating, the review would need to offer more context, specific details, and clarity about the subject or item being reviewed."},{"question":"Description:FlowerheadofCommonToadflax Please segment the words.","response":"The phrase you provided can be segmented into the following words: Flower head of Common Toadflax. Now, let me provide you with a detailed and long answer about the flower head of Common Toadflax. The Common Toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has been introduced to North America and other regions as an ornamental plant and is now considered invasive in some areas. Commonly known as Yellow Toadflax, Butter-and-Eggs, or Wild Snapdragon, this plant is easily recognized by its beautiful and unique flower head. The flower head of the Common Toadflax consists of a cluster of bright yellow, snapdragon-like flowers with an orange-brown lower lip. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and tubular in shape, measuring approximately 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) in length. They are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes atop unbranched, erect stems that are up to 3 feet (0.9 meters) tall. The flower head can contain as many as 25 individual flowers. The Common Toadflax flowers from June to October, attracting various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant's nectar-rich flowers are particularly favored by long-tongued bumblebees, which can access the nectar at the base of the tubular flowers. The flowers are self-fertile, meaning that they can produce seeds without the need for fertilization from another plant, ensuring the plant's survival and spread. As for the foliage, Common Toadflax has thin, linear leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. These leaves are grayish-green in color and can grow up to 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) long. The plant has a shallow and spreading root system, and it can propagate both sexually through seeds and asexually through its creeping rhizomes. The seeds of the Common Toadflax are tiny and black, with each flower head capable of producing up to 300 seeds. This prolific seed production contributes to the plant's invasive nature, as the seeds are quickly dispersed by wind, water, and animals. While often considered a weed, the Common Toadflax has been used in traditional medicine and herbal remedies, primarily as a diuretic and laxative. However, caution is advised when using this plant for medicinal purposes, as it contains toxic compounds called quinolizidine alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. In summary, the flower head of the Common Toadflax is a striking feature of this perennial herb, characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers with a distinctive orange-brown lower lip. While admired for its ornamental value, the plant's ability to spread quickly and its potential toxicity should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to introduce it into your garden or natural landscape."},{"question":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Article: One day, a man found the cocoon of a butterfly and he brought it home. A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Question: What does the writer want to tell us? Options: A: Kindness in our lives can help us grow. B: Try to be ready to help others. C: Without other's help we can still succeed. D: Hard work leads to success.

Sentence 2: They are warmly embraced by the Vatican. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the two sentences convey contrasting information about the Vatican's stance on the ecumenical agreements. In the first sentence, the statement clearly indicates that the ecumenical agreement with Lutherans and a similar agreement have not been embraced as authoritative by the Vatican. It suggests a lack of recognition or acceptance of these agreements by the Vatican, possibly due to doctrinal, theological, or practical differences. On the contrary, in the second sentence, the expression \\"warmly embraced by the Vatican\\" implies a sense of strong approval, acceptance, and support towards whatever is being referred to, which contradicts the information supplied in the first sentence. In conclusion, the second sentence does not follow or entail from the first sentence. Instead, it presents an opposing view regarding the Vatican's attitude towards the subject matter, which in this case are ecumenical agreements."},{"question":"В этой веселой развлекательной комедии снялись такие звезды как Джим Бродбент в роли грубого отца и великолепный Брендон Глисон в роли бандита Перрье.

Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes.

Question: What might a person heading overseas do? Options: A. shout at B. feel happy C. cross street D. board ship E. get pasport Answer:","response":"A person heading overseas might do several things in preparation for their journey and to make the most of their experience abroad. Here are some detailed explanations for each option: A. Shout at - This option doesn't seem to be in line with common sense when referring to someone heading overseas. Shouting at others is generally not a constructive or polite behavior, and it does not directly relate to traveling internationally. B. Feel happy - This option is in line with common sense in the context of traveling overseas. Many people feel happy and excited when they have the opportunity to travel internationally. This experience often means exploring new places, meeting new people, and learning about different cultures, which can be very thrilling and enjoyable for many individuals. C. Cross street - Although crossing the street is a daily activity that people do, it doesn't relate directly to preparing for or traveling overseas. This action might be taken by someone when exploring their destination, but it's not specifically tied to the experience of heading overseas. D. Board ship - This option is in line with common sense. A person heading overseas might choose to travel by ship, either for leisure (such as a cruise) or as a mode of transportation to reach their destination. Boats and ships can be a viable option for traveling across large bodies of water, making this a possible, though not the most common, choice for international travel, as many people opt for air transportation. E. Get passport - This option is also in line with common sense. In most cases, a person heading overseas will need a valid passport to travel internationally. A passport is an essential document that serves as proof of identity and nationality, allowing individuals to enter and exit foreign countries legally. Obtaining a passport is one of the critical steps in preparing for international travel. In summary, options B, D, and E are in line with common sense as they all relate directly to the preparation and experience of heading overseas. However, if we were to choose one option that is most critical and directly related to the process of traveling overseas, option E (Get passport) stands as the most essential step for a person heading overseas, since it is a requirement for international travel."},{"question":"Translate \\"Despite the good intentions we all have, whether we sit on the right or left side in this House, we are unable to make a decision which is received positively and welcomed by each Member State.\\" to Romanian?","response":"În ciuda intențiilor bune pe care le avem cu toții, indiferent dacă stăm în partea dreaptă sau stângă în această Cameră, nu putem lua o decizie care este primită pozitiv și binevenită de către fiecare stat membru.

She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day.

Article: Eat less and exercise more--it has long been a magic word for reducing those extra weight. But now it seems that all the hard work may have been in vain. Scientists say there are ten other reasons why people just keep getting bigger. They say that sleeping habits, central heating, medicines and even some pollutants can play a role in weight gain. Traditionally, people have focused on diet and exercise to solve the problem. However the scientists from top US and Canadian universities say that other things must be considered. Lack of sleep could be partly the reason. In recent years, the average night's sleep has dropped from nine hours to just seven. Sleep shortage changes levels of the hormones that control food intake and body fat and increase hunger and appetite. If it is too hot or too cold, we burn calories to cool down or heat up. But if the temperature is just right, the calories may be turned into body fat instead. Those who take medicine to control their blood pressure can often put on weight. Similarly, studies have shown that going on the Pill can add to a woman's weight. Mother nature may also be the reason, with our body shape being partly inherited . The overweight are also more likely to settle with partners of a similar size. And their children are more likely to be obese . And the use of pollutants is on the rise, say the researchers. The man-made chemicals in pesticides and plastics can lead to weight gain. Your mother's age and your weight at birth are also important, with older woman more likely to have obese children and underweight babies having a bigger chance of being obese in later life. We also tend to put on weight as we get older. Finally, giving up smoking can also help pile on the pounds. The scientists from Yale, Cornell and Johns Hopkins said there was some evidence supporting poor diet and lack of exercise as the main causes of obesity. Question: Which of the following factors doesn't lead to overweight? Answer: Answer:","response":"Central heating, sleep shortage, medicines, pollutants, inherited body shape, mother's age, weight at birth, and giving up smoking are all mentioned as factors that can contribute to weight gain. The temperature being \\"just right\\" is mentioned as a condition that could lead to calories being turned into body fat. However, among these factors, there is no mention of any factor that would not lead to overweight."},{"question":"Given the question: I have a new situation: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which village experiences fewer rocks breaking? The answer is:","response":"Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking. This is implied by the information that Arrow village gets only a few earthquakes annually, compared to Bow village which gets a lot. This means that the rocks in the area of Arrow village break less often, resulting in fewer earthquakes."},{"question":"Question: \\"Excerpts of this work by Strauss are often used commercially.\\" Context: \\"Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become clichéd, particularly the opening of Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra (made famous in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey) and the opening section \\"O Fortuna\\" of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, often used in the horror genre; other examples include the Dies Irae from the Verdi Requiem, Edvard Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt, the opening bars of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries from Die Walküre, Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee, and excerpts of Aaron Copland's Rodeo.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra, a tone poem composed in 1896, has indeed been prominently featured in various commercial settings. As mentioned in the context provided, the piece owes much of its fame to its appearance in Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The iconic opening fanfare, famously titled \\"Sunrise,\\" has become a symbol of grandeur and a harbinger of mighty revelations since its association with the portrayal of the dawn of man and the cosmic mysteries explored in the film. This association has led to the widespread commercial use of this particular excerpt from Strauss' work. The effectiveness of Also sprach Zarathustra in capturing the attention of audiences stems from its powerful and enigmatic musical themes. The opening fanfare features a bold C-G-C motif played by the brass section, punctuated by timpani and accompanied by a sustained low C on the organ. This pattern is contrasted with the serene, ascending melody played by the woodwind section, creating a sense of awe and wonder. As the piece progresses, the orchestration becomes even more lavish and colorful, and the musical themes are developed and transformed. The commercial appeal of Also sprach Zarathustra is further bolstered by the work's fascinating programmatic content. Strauss drew inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical novel of the same name, in which the prophet Zarathustra proclaims the death of God and advocates for the creation of new values to upend conventional morality. The music evokes the spirit of this bold endeavor with its tumultuous dynamics and harmonies, reflecting both the triumph and tragedy of humankind's quest for meaning and enlightenment. In the world of advertising, the use of the opening fanfare from Also sprach Zarathustra has become almost a cliché, heard in numerous commercials to convey a sense of grand achievement or momentous discovery. For instance, it has been used by companies introducing revolutionary products or technologies, as well as by automotive manufacturers to underscore the power and luxury of their vehicles. The piece has also been featured in numerous film trailers, particularly for movies that aspire to epic or profound themes. Beyond commercials, the \\"Sunrise\\" fanfare and other excerpts from Also sprach Zarathustra can be found in various forms of popular culture, such as television, film, and sporting events. In these contexts, the music serves a similar function, drawing upon its inherent sense of majesty and awe, as well as its associations with revolutionary breakthroughs and transcendental experiences. In conclusion, the enduring appeal and success of Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra in commercial settings can be attributed to a combination of its powerful musical language, its provocative programmatic content, and its established cultural associations with the exploration of unknown frontiers and the unfolding of cosmic mysteries."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

We have this equation: 0 = 9485 * q - 9722 * q + 237 Imagine you have 9485 apples and you give away 9722 apples. You would then owe someone apples, right? To know how many apples you owe, you can subtract 9722 - 9485, which is 237. So far, the equation can be written as: 0 = -237 * q + 237 Now, imagine you have a box that can hold -237 apples (remember, we owe apples). We need to find out how many boxes we must fill to cancel out the apples we owe. To do this, we can set up a proportion. We have -237 (apples we owe) divided by 237 (apples we are trying to cancel), which is equal to q (the number of boxes we need). The proportion looks like this: -237 / 237 = q When you divide -237 by 237, you get -1. So, we need -1 boxes to cancel out the apples we owe. Therefore, the answer to the math problem is: q = -1"},{"question":"Write a negative movie review.","response":"Title: Disappointment at the Box Office: A Review of \\"The Broken Dream\\" Step 1: Start by providing an introductory summary of the movie. As an AI, I aim to create a solid understanding of the movie for the readers to know what it is about. Hence, I begin with a brief description of the movie's plot and main characters. The Broken Dream, a film directed by John McFailure, journeys into the life of Michael Thompson (played by Alex Overrated), a once-successful businessman who finds himself at rock-bottom following a series of unfortunate events. Alongside Michael is his long-suffering wife, Sarah (played by Emma Misplaced), who desperately tries to hold their crumbling marriage together during these trying times. Step 2: Highlight the major issues in the movie. As an AI, my goal is to express the issues and concerns to make the readers aware of the negative aspects of the movie. I will identify some of the major issues with the plot, acting, and direction. First and foremost, The Broken Dream suffers from a clichéd and uninspired plotline. It is hard for the viewer to invest in the story, as we have seen similar narratives far too often in other movies. It feels like a retelling of the same old tale with a different title. Moving on, the acting feels wooden and unnatural. Alex Overrated's portrayal of the struggling Michael Thompson falls flat, lacking the necessary depth and realness the character so desperately needed. Emma Misplaced, on the other hand, tries her best with her limited screen time, but ultimately, her performance fails to leave a lasting impact. Lastly, blame must be assigned to John McFailure's direction, who fails to make the movie engaging or thought-provoking. The over-the-top melodrama used to evoke emotion from the audience comes off as unrealistic and almost comical at times, diminishing the overall experience. Step 3: Address other specific aspects of the movie. It is crucial to outline the other negative aspects of the movie while considering all the different elements that contribute to a film's success or failure. One also cannot ignore the atrocious dialogue found in the screenplay, penned by Lilly Lackluster. It lacks the necessary wit and creativity to make the characters feel believable and relatable. In many instances, the dialogue feels disconnected from the characters themselves. Additionally, the film's pacing is slow and unimaginative. It drags on for an excessive two hours, forcing audience members to glance at their watches frequently. Key events in the story feel unnecessarily stretched out, and it often feels as though the film is stalling, rather than moving forward. Step 4: Conclude by stating the overall verdict and recommendation. Finally, I compose a fitting conclusion that summarizes my negative review and provides a recommendation for potential viewers. In conclusion, The Broken Dream is a colossal disappointment, riddled with clichés, a bland storyline, and uninspiring acting. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone seeking a thought-provoking or enjoyable cinematic experience. Save your money and time and give this one a miss; there are countless better options available at the box office."},{"question":"Choose your answer from options.

OPT: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","response":"After carefully analyzing the given premise and hypothesis, it appears that the answer would be option (3). no. The reason for this conclusion is as follows: The premise states that \\"In other words, the questions he got from reporters focused on politics and positioning to the total exclusion of his actual policies and positions.\\" This indicates that the questions he received were entirely about politics and positioning, and there were no questions about his actual policies and positions. The inclusion of \\"to the total exclusion of\\" signifies that these topics were not addressed at all in the questions. Now, let's take a look at the hypothesis: \\"He received questions on politics and positioning instead of questions on actual policies and positions yet it was still very informative.\\" The hypothesis also acknowledges that he received questions on politics and positioning instead of actual policies and positions. However, it implies that the conversation was still informative. The contradiction lies in the fact that the premise implies a lack of information regarding his actual policies and positions, while the hypothesis suggests that the discussion was still informative. It's not possible for the conversation to be very informative when the primary focus, as per the premise, was solely on politics and positioning and not on the subject’s actual policies and positions.

Outside Madison Square Garden, it’s easy to find a friendly family of goths — one current, two formers and their mom. (She just likes to wear black.) Ask them what goth means today, and you get an answer much like black-clad kids have been giving for the past — wow, nearly 40 years. Goth is realism, says Martin Willis, 23, who is wearing a black leather jacket and black lipstick, and whose green eyes are rimmed for an undead look. “I see how the world is, and I just want to cry to no end,” he says. Goth is remarkably hardy, a subculture that’s established itself as a kind of permanent Other, the dark yin to our country’s relentlessly optimistic yang. After its emergence in the late 1970s, its ethos of despair and decay traveled around the world, colonizing places as diverse as Germany, Mexico and Japan, and setting up permanent camp in the United States, where the question of “what is goth?” has lately become fraught. Or maybe it always was. For example: Is Kylie Jenner goth? Journalists have casually tagged the Kardashian sibling as such, now that she is hawking black lipsticks in shades called “Dead of Knight” and “Kymajesty Metal Matte.” This is the sort of thing that sends actual goths into fits of apocalyptic frenzy, since they consider their subculture so much more than a fleeting summer beauty look. Indeed, the idea of mainstream absorption is regarded as a kind of existential threat by many goths, who as a result tend to be Talmudically precise about what they are, and what they aren’t. “I blame Hot Topic,” says Janice Mallardi, Willis’s sister, who at 25, married and with a kid, has aged out of calling herself goth but still seems to carry it in her heart. “There’s a serious dilution of what had been traditional goth culture,” says her husband, Malcolm, 36. “Like the classic vampire film! The ‘Twilight’ films have kind of killed the classics for me.” If you ask a goth academic — because of course there are goth academics — it’s this constant process of questioning and defining that keeps the subculture vibrant. On this, the third and final night of the Cure’s sold-out Madison Square Garden run, there are many people wearing their inner darkness for all to see. There’s a mother-and-daughter punk-goth pair (the daughter has epic black eye makeup and feels a strong emotional connection to bats), and there’s a guy in a Kylo Ren costume — the dark side of the Force, you know. There are also plenty of normals, because plenty of kinds of people enjoy the Cure’s music, which ranges from gloomy to eerily atmospheric to playful pop. God willing, there will always be kids like Martin Willis, who considers himself an anarchist, and a bit of a nihilist, who finds wandering old graveyards comforting, and describes Marilyn Manson songs as “cheery” because they prove he’s not alone in his melancholy. There’s something about goth that feels like a necessary critique of Americanness, no less urgent for being in middle age. “I think ‘normal’ is a fad that should go away, honestly,” Willis says. After nearly four decades, goth lumbers on, zombielike in its relentless opposition to whatever counts as mainstream at the moment. The gothic rock sound, as the press and music insiders termed it, emerged in late-1970s Britain, giving rise to the post-punk subculture that became known as goth. It drew on a “discordant bricolage of hyperromantic elements,” as the scholarly text “Goth: Undead Subculture” puts it: vampires, Mary Shelley, Nosferatu, druids, pagans, Bettie Page, absinthe-fueled readings of Edward Gorey and so on. It served as a door into cultural subversion and also as a refuge for intellectuals and depressives, outcasts and downcasts, the quiet and misunderstood. Kids alienated from football-and-cheerleader culture found solace in goth; kids who liked old poetry and old tombstones; kids who loved Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and Bauhaus. As goths, they could band together and eschew their mundane given names for something like Drusilla or Hades. The ’80s and ’90s were a good time for goth, until, with the Columbine school shootings, they weren’t. Some media reports claimed the two shooters were obsessed with the subculture, and goths were put on the defensive, forced to explain that their love of moody music and Doc Martens had nothing whatsoever to do with homicidal atrocities. There’s still the occasional scare, such as when a group of “men dressed in black” walking along a Muscatine County, Iowa, roadside triggered a police report. But the public image has softened; a 2004 Edmonton Journal headline proclaimed the finding that “Goth subculture of outcasts surprisingly gentle, polite.” (“Bizarre dress,” the headline went on to explain, is merely a “welcoming signal to like-minded.”) Other music-based subcultures have flashed and faded — grunge, mods, Teddy boys, hair metal — but goth persists, despite the fact that the bands most associated with it made their names decades ago. The scene has spawned a ton of subtypes, including trad goths, vamp goths, rivetheads, romantigoths, cyber goths, nu goths, gothic Lolitas (they started in Japan, naturally) and corp goths (for those who grew up and became paralegals). As “Goth: Undead Subculture” points out, the goth look can mean chunky boots or high-heeled ones, cravats or riding crops or top hats, piercings, whiteface, fangs . . . all for a look that “may evoke high chic, antique, retro-kitsch, punk, fetish, second-hand trash,” or something else altogether. Goth expert Liisa Ladouceur wrote an entire “Encyclopedia Gothica” in an attempt to answer the question of what goth is. (Short answer: It’s complicated.) Lee Meadows, who is known as DJ Cruel Brittania, says the Internet saved goth, just when it should have logically gone extinct. Dispersed online, it became a refuge for all the sad kids of the world who felt that no one in their small towns understood them. In 2009, Meadows co-founded World Goth Day, and now Mexico and Brazil — those sunny, happy places — are among the most avid participants; festivals in England and Germany draw thousands as well. In the United States, the scene appears to be steady, neither growing nor shrinking. Some goths age out; young’uns come along. Between 6,000 and 7,000 people this year attended Bats Day in the Fun Park, an annual goth convention that takes place in and around Disneyland. In Denver, there was recently a “goth prom” that drew 500 people, with a special appearance by enthusiasts of the Denver Hearse Association. In D.C., a monthly dance party known as the Coven and designed for queer “witchy” women, attracts 300 people every month. Goth girls still seek goth guys on Craigslist. Goth seems to stay in people’s souls, even when they grow up and get jobs and have kids and stop dressing quite as outrageously as they once did. It is an outlook, a refuge, a dark corner made friendly by the presence of others. Hence: elder goths. “They told me it was too hot today to wear all black and I said, ‘Screw ’em,’ ” says Judy Miller Silverman, a music publicist who turned goth as an ’80s teenager and once scandalized her Jewish mother by wearing a cross (goths love crosses), and recently tweeted out her joy at the introduction of the new black heart emoji. The identity has such enduring appeal to those who see themselves as lifers that it has spawned not one, but two goth-themed cruises. One of them, called GothCruise, is celebrating its 13th year with a trip to Maine, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The theme: “Disasters and Apocalypses.” And now, goth is enduring another crossover moment. The fashion magazine Nylon reports that “goth style is more mainstream than ever” — Katy Perry, the Olsen twins and all your favorite celebs are wearing it! “Gothic glamour” was on display at runway shows by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte, and in the collaboration between Rihanna and Puma. Kylie Jenner is pushing those black lipsticks while older sister Kendall recently starred in a dystopian fashion shoot with Marilyn Manson, who is himself having a mini-moment. (He’s due to appear in the third season of “Salem,” as a bloodletting barber/surgeon, naturally.) According to celebrity chroniclers, Taylor Swift was for a time channeling her “inner goth” — a notion that is like matter meeting antimatter and the universe exploding. “We’re certainly in a phase where people do wear black lipstick,” says Ladouceur, who recently released a delightful short video called “Forty Years of Goth Style.” “I’m not sure why. We wear it to be unpretty. . . . It’s fascinating to me when pretty people start to wear our weird stuff.” Other things Ladouceur and her friends like to wear: Corsets. Fishnets. Platform heels. Fascinators. Parasols. Various items made of rubber. “If you’re going to go out in August wearing a velvet cape you can’t be upset when people stare,” Ladouceur says. “The average person would never go out wearing the stuff that me and my friends wear. They would feel ridiculous. And I love that. It takes a commitment.” Perhaps all this fashionable darkness is linked to a gloomy strain that’s been bubbling up in our culture. The science of death is big right now, as are mortality-themed gatherings such as Death Cafes. Last year, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art had an exhibit on the last century of mourning attire. The Cure’s North American tour has absolutely blown up. The poet Melissa Broder, who tweets her dark humor to 367,000 followers under @SoSadToday, has a new book of personal essays. (Sample: “I’m not emotionally dead I just want to be.” And: “bringing another person into this world isn’t very nice of you.”) Lynne Zacek Bassett, who curated the recent show “Gothic to Goth: Romantic Era Fashion & Its Legacy” at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Conn., says that both goth and retrofuturistic steampunk — which offers a mock Victorian vision of sci-fi, complete with bustles, brass goggles and world-touring dirigibles — trace their roots to the romantic era of the first half of the 19th century, which was itself an idealization of a rural past that emerged during the Sturm und Drang of the Industrial Revolution. Bassett argues that this kind of looking back crops up during times of social and economic anxiety. But what will hopefully save goth is that there’s a limit to how mainstream it can become. Its unprettiness is transgressive, as is the confusing way it mixes sexiness and decay. Goth’s androgyny, its embrace of eyelinered men in long skirts, isn’t easily appropriated by a masculinized culture, argues Michael Bibby, an English professor at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania who co-edited “Goth: Undead Subculture,” and its music isn’t easily used in commercials — how do you sell something as downbeat as death? It functions as both a way of life and as an artful pose, a critique of ­“happy-happy culture,” as Bibby calls it. If it makes normals uncomfortable, that’s the point. Perhaps we always needed goth. Perhaps we always had it. “Before people started calling themselves goth, there were goths,” says Bob Westphal, who runs the aforementioned GothCruise. “Where did the Addams Family come from? Where did the Munsters come from? Where did dark humor come from? Could that retroactively be called goth? Has goth always existed?” What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The news article focuses on the enduring appeal of the goth subculture, which has been in existence for nearly 40 years. Originating from the gothic rock sound of late-1970s Britain, goth has grown into a worldwide phenomenon, with many subtypes emerging along the way, like trad goths, vamp goths, and cyber goths, just to name a few. The article discusses the influence of goth on modern popular culture, with celebrities like Katy Perry and the Olsen twins embracing goth style and fashion. It also touches on how goth has been perceived and its resilience as a subculture as it has transcended social and economic anxieties. The article highlights the deeply rooted aspects of goth which continue to attract new followers, as well as those who have stayed involved for years. It explores the idea that goth offers a dark critique of Americanness and mainstream culture, thriving on its ambiguity and transgressive nature. For many, goth is more than just a passing trend, but an enduring outlook and refuge that cannot be entirely absorbed by mainstream society. Goth has a sense of permanence, as followers maintain their beliefs even as they transition to different stages in life."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"\\"Je mange une pomme\\" ist ein Satz auf Französisch, der bedeutet: \\"Ich esse einen Apfel.\\" In dieser Sprache sprechen die Menschen in Frankreich."},{"question":"Festivalul are loc în mod tradiţional în luna iulie, când majoritatea emigranţilor macedoneni se întorc acasă pentru a-şi vizita rudele şi pentru a se bucura de vacanţă.

Understand the sentence: The given sentence states that Adam needs to avoid someone named Kenneth for the sake of his psychological health. It implies that there is something about Kenneth that threatens Adam's mental well-being. 2. Evaluate each option: (A). Adam was very vulnerable. (B). Kenneth was very vulnerable.

Option (B) suggests that Kenneth was the vulnerable one. However, this does not logically explain why Adam needs to avoid Kenneth for the sake of his own psychological health. Between the two options, option (A) fits the sentence more logically because the sentence is setting up an explanation for why Adam needs to avoid Kenneth.

Step 2: Determine the amount of work completed after Y works for 10 days Since Y works at a rate of 1/15 of the work per day, after 10 days, he would have completed: (1/15) * 10 = 10/15 = 2/3 of the work Step 3: Determine the amount of work remaining Since Y completed 2/3 of the work, there's 1/3 of the work left.

To complete 1/3 of the work, we can set up the equation: (1/18) * number of days = 1/3 Multiplying both sides by 18, we get: number of days = 18/3 number of days = 6 Therefore, X alone needs 6 days to finish the remaining work, so the correct answer is (C) 6."},{"question":"How do you say \\"They do all the work themselves, they write the music, the lyrics and perform like chemists mixing and mixing until they find the secret recipe.\\" in Spanish?","response":"To translate the given English sentence to Spanish, I will first break down the sentence into smaller phrases and translate each phrase individually.

Solve this problem.","response":"To solve the equation 47*y + 86 = 4*y for y, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Subtract the 4*y term from both sides of the equation. 47*y + 86 - 4*y = 4*y - 4*y This simplifies to: 43*y + 86 = 0 Step 2: Now, we want to isolate the y term. To do this, we'll subtract 86 from both sides of the equation. 43*y + 86 - 86 = 0 - 86 This simplifies to: 43*y = -86 Step 3: To find the value of y, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 43. (43*y)/43 = (-86)/43 This simplifies to: y = -2 So the solution to the equation 47*y + 86 = 4*y is y = -2."},{"question":"What happens next in this paragraph?

The man uses tools to shave and clean another man's neck. Now let me explain why the other answers are wrong: 1). The man is inside a building, so he wouldn't need to hold a shield against a cold wind because it's not cold inside. 2). Pulling up shingles on a roof is an outdoor activity. The man is inside a building, so he can't be on the roof. 4). Welding is a process used to join materials, usually metals, by heating them.

However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg in 1636. All of Aichinger's followers were slaughtered during the battle, including the remaining women and children who had been in hiding. How many uprisings occurred outside of the 16th century?","response":"In order to determine how many uprisings occurred outside of the 16th century, we must first look at the total number of known uprisings, which is 62. Since there were 14 uprisings in the 16th century, we need to subtract that number from the total uprisings. 62 uprisings (total) - 14 uprisings (16th century) = 48 uprisings Thus, there were 48 uprisings in Upper Austria outside of the 16th century between 1356 and 1849."},{"question":"Question: Fossil fuels are considered a nonrenewable resource because they What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?","response":"In the context of your question, it seems you'd like me to provide an explanation for why fossil fuels are considered a nonrenewable resource. Unfortunately, the choices for the correct answer were not provided. However, I will give you a detailed explanation of why fossil fuels are nonrenewable. Fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas, are considered nonrenewable resources because they are formed over millions of years from the remains of dead plants and animals that are subjected to high pressure and temperature conditions deep in the Earth's crust. These conditions transform the organic matter into deposits of carbon-rich substances which eventually become fossil fuels. There are several factors that contribute to fossil fuels being classified as nonrenewable: 1. Formation time: Fossil fuels take millions of years to form, making their supply finite and restricted to the deposits that already exist underground. When we extract and burn these fuels, we are using an energy source that won't be replenished within a human timescale. In contrast, renewable resources such as solar, wind, and hydropower are sources of energy that can be replenished within a short period of time, making them more sustainable alternatives. 2. Depletion rate: The rate at which humans are extracting and consuming fossil fuels is much faster than their formation process. As a result, the available reserves of these nonrenewable resources are being rapidly depleted. This can lead to an eventual scarcity of fossil fuels and an increase in their prices, which could significantly impact global economies and energy security. 3. Environmental impacts: The extraction, processing, and burning of fossil fuels have significant negative impacts on the environment, such as producing high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change, and causing pollution to air, land, and water. Additionally, their nonrenewability means that we cannot rely on them indefinitely and must eventually transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. 4. Geopolitical issues: The uneven distribution of fossil fuel reserves around the world leads to geopolitical tensions and competition for access to these valuable resources. Energy security and economic disparities are often tied to the availability of fossil fuels. These issues would be mitigated by transitioning to renewable energy sources, which are more evenly distributed around the world and less prone to geopolitical strife. In summary, fossil fuels are considered nonrenewable resources due to their finite supply, the millions of years it takes for their formation, the high rate at which we consume them, and the environmental and geopolitical issues associated with their use. As a result, there is a growing urgency to develop and invest in alternative, renewable energy sources in order to mitigate the negative consequences of our reliance on fossil fuels and ensure a more sustainable future."},{"question":"Q:Question: Where is a good place to keep many a pencil?

Translate to Finnish","response":"Kaikki tämä osoittaa, kuinka skandaalimainen tämä päätös on, ja Vilvoorde on vain viimeisin pitkässä sarjassa tehtaan sulkemisia. Tämä päätös on herättänyt paljon kohua ja kiistoja ympäri maailmaa, ja Vilvoorden tapaus on lisännyt siihen entisestään. Teollisuudenalalla tehdassulkemiset ovat valitettavan yleisiä, mutta jokainen niistä tuo mukanaan omanlaisensa seuraukset niin työntekijöille, ympäröiville yhteisöille kuin koko taloudellekin. Vilvoorden tehdassulkeminen ei ole vain paikallinen ongelma, vaan se heijastaa laajempaa teollisuuden muutosta, jossa yritykset pyrkivät minimoimaan kustannuksia ja tehostamaan toimintaansa usein työpaikkojen menetyksen kustannuksella. Tämä taas johtaa taloudelliseen epätasa-arvoon ja sosiaalisiin ongelmiin, joihin yhteiskuntien tulee löytää kestäviä ratkaisuja. Myös globalisaatio ja teknologinen kehitys ovat osasyyllisiä tehtaiden sulkemisiin. Yritykset voivat siirtää tuotantolaitoksiaan maapallon toiselle puolelle, missä työvoimakustannukset ovat alhaisemmat ja säännöstely vähemmän tiukkaa. Samalla automaatio ja teknologinen kehitys voivat vähentää tarvetta inhimilliselle työvoimalle, mikä voi johtaa tehtaiden sulkemisiin ja irtisanomisiin. Vilvoorden tapaus on toki erityisen kohutuksi nousseen päätöksen takia noussut laajemman huomion kohteeksi. Tämä osoittaa, kuinka tärkeää on parantaa elinkeinorakenteita ja tarjota koulutusta sekä tukea työntekijöille uusien työmahdollisuuksien löytämiseksi. On välttämätöntä pohtia myös niitä laajempia rakenteellisia muutoksia, joilla teollisuudenalalla voidaan vastata nopeasti muuttuviin ympäristöihin ja haasteisiin ilman massiivisia työpaikkamenetyksiä. Tulevaisuudessa tärkeintä olisi löytää tasapaino taloudellisen kasvun ja kestävän keikkansa välillä niin, että myös yhteiskunnan heikommassa asemassa olevien ryhmien etuja ja oikeuksia kunnioitetaan eikä työntekijöitä käytetä vain pelinappuloina yritysten voittojen maksimoinnissa.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] Paragraph: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south.

In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa. The answer to this question is:","response":"The answer to this question is: Lady Clarissa Pevensey. She is mentioned in the text as \\"a great admirer of the Prime Minister.\\""},{"question":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A man fills up an old bucket with sand.\\" is it true that \\"A man fills a bucket.\\"?. Teacher: Let's think:","response":"1. The original sentence states that \\"A man fills up an old bucket with sand.\\" 2. We know that a man is involved in the action of filling a bucket. 3. This action involves filling up a bucket, which indicates that a bucket is indeed being filled. 4. The modifier \\"old\\" is utilized to describe the bucket in the original sentence, but it does not change the fact that a bucket is being filled. So, based on these observations, we can conclude that the statement \\"A man fills a bucket.\\" is true. It simplifies the original sentence by removing the additional details such as the \\"old\\" bucket and the \\"sand,\\" but retains the core idea that a man is filling a bucket."},{"question":"Here is an article: WHEN: Today, Wednesday, June 3rd Following is the unofficial transcript of a FIRST ON CNBC interview with Lowercase Capital's Chris Sacca on CNBC's \\"Closing Bell\\" (M-F, 3PM-5PM ET) today.

A MAJOR TWITTER SHAREHOLDER CALLING FOR SOME BIG CHANGES TO THE SOCIAL NETWORK TODAY. LOWERCASE CAPITAL'S CHRIS SACCA SAID A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH OUR OWN JIM CRAMER INSPIRED HIM TO PUT THE NOTE OUT. CRAMER'S BEEN A VOCAL CRITIC OF CEO DICK COSTOLO. SOUND FROM JIM CRAMER ON \\"MAD MONEY\\": I BELIEVE THAT TWITTER REMAINS A GOLD MINE. AND WHILE I THOUGHT THESE FOLKS HAD FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MINE IT, I WAS WRONG. TO MINE THE GOLD, TWITTER HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND WHILE IT IS COOL, WELL, COOL'S NOT TRANSLATING INTO NUMBERS. HOW CAN THIS SEVERE DECREE BE REVERSED? BY PRAYER? IF IT KEEPS FAILING, WELL LET'S JUST SAY SOMEONE ELSE WILL TAKE CARE OF TWITTER. NOW I DON'T THINK MOST INVESTORS ARE GOING TO BE THAT PATIENT. HENCE, AGAIN, MORE PAIN. EVANS: WELL, CHRIS SACCA JOINS ME NOW, IN A FIRST ON CNBC INTERVIEW, ALONG WITH OUR VERY OWN JULIA BOORSTIN. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. SO CHRIS, JIM SUGGESTED PRAYER. YOUR SUGGESTIONS HAVE MORE TO DO WITH LIVE CHANNELS AND A SAVE BUTTON. WHAT DO YOU THINK TWITTER REALLY NEEDS TO DO HERE TO INCREASE THE USE OF THIS PRODUCT? CHRIS SACCA: I THINK TWITTER JUST NEEDS TO GO OUT AND COURT THE NEXT FEW HUNDRED MILLION USERS. INCREMENTAL CHANGES TO THE EXISTING PRODUCT AREN'T GOING TO DO IT. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR AN EASIER WAY TO SEE TWEETS, AN EASIER WAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NETWORK, AND THEY WANT TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THERE, ENGAGED, HAVING FUN. THEY'RE APPRECIATE THERE. AND I THINK THERE ARE CLEAR STEPS TO GET THE PRODUCT IN THAT DIRECTION. EVANS: SURE. AND YOU WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR ACQUISITION OF PERISCOPE FOR LIVE VIDEO. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS YOU MAKE HAS TO DO WITH AN APP CALLED NUZZLE, WHICH HAS A WAY OF KIND OF TAKING CONTENT AND MAKING IT MORE READABLE, LIKE A NEWSPAPER, FROM TWITTER. SO IS THIS SOMETHING THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO BY ACQUISITIONS? OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IF DICK COSTOLO WOKE UP TOMORROW AND DECIDED HE WANTED THESE ADDITIONAL FEATURES, THESE BUTTONS THAT YOU MENTIONED, HE COULD AND SHOULD DO IT? SACCA: THERE IS AN EASY PATH TO GO AND ACQUIRE SOME OF THESE COMPANIES, BUT THEY COULD DO THIS STUFF ORGANICALLY. THE CHALLENGE IS THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR YEARS. THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING FOR A LONG TIME, INSIDE AND AROUND THE COMPANY. AND SO AS A SHAREHOLDER, I JUST WANT TO SEE THEM EXECUTE ON THIS STUFF. I THINK IT CAN BE SO MUCH EASIER TO SEE THE GREAT NEWS THAT'S HAPPENING THERE, SEE THE GREAT PHOTOS AND VIDEOS, TO FOLLOW LIVE EVENTS, TO FOLLOW A TOPIC OR SPORT IF THAT'S ALL YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. I THINK THESE ARE OBVIOUS PATHS THE COMPANY CAN GO DOWN, AND THEY WILL COURT THE NEXT FEW HUNDRED MILLION USERS VERY QUICKLY, VERY EASILY. JULIA BOORSTIN: HI, CHRIS, JULIA HERE. NOW YOU DID NOT COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON CEO DICK COSTOLO AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK HE'S THE RIGHT PERSON TO BE RUNNING THE COMPANY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? SACCA: LOOK, IF THEY EXECUTE ON THE KINDS OF IDEAS THAT I PUT OUT THERE, WHICH BY THE WAY AREN'T MY IDEAS ALONE, BUT IDEAS OF MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CARED ABOUT THIS COMPANY FOR YEARS, THEN NOBODY WILL BE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT DICK IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. IF THIS IS NOT THE STUFF THEY'RE WORKING ON AND THEY CAN'T GET THIS STUFF DONE, THEN I THINK THE BOARD IS GOING TO ACT IN THE INTEREST OF THE SHAREHOLDERS. BUT I, AS I NOTE IN THE MEMO, AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DIRECTION THEY'RE MOVING IN WITH A FEW OF THEIR RECENT PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND I JUST HOPE THEY GO FARTHER AND FASTER WITH THAT STUFF. BOORSTIN: NOW, YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT AN ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDER, BUT YOU JUST WROTE THIS 8,500-WORD MISSIVE ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK TWITTER NEEDS TO DO. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SELL SHARES IF YOU DON'T SEE THESE CHANGES. SACCA: NO, I'M NOT OUT THERE SELLING SHARES. THERE'S NO PUNITIVE RESULT IF TWITTER DOESN'T DO THIS KIND OF STUFF. IT'S JUST, I WAS LITERALLY ONE OF THE FIRST INVESTORS IN THE COMPANY, AN ADVISER OF THE COMPANY SINCE ITS EARLY DAYS. I HAVE 1.5 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON TWITTER, I USE IT EVERY DAY, IT'S INFLUENCED EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE. I'M OBSESSED WITH THE COMPANY. AND WHEN YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR NINE YEARS, IT TURNS OUT YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT IT. HENCE THE 8,500 WORDS. WHEN YOU CARE THAT DEEPLY ABOUT SOMETHING, YOU WANT TO SEE IT REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL, AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WITH TWITTER AT THIS POINT. AND I THINK IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT HARD. EVANS: AND YET, CHRIS, YOU SEEM TO BE AT ODDS WITH OTHER TWITTER INVESTORS LIKE FRED WILSON, WHO REPLIED TO YOUR INDICATION YOU WOULD HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE COMPANY THIS WEEK BY SAYING, I OWN A LOT OF TWITTER AND I'M A BIG FAN OF THE COMPANY AND OF DICK. WHAT MORE DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO FRED AT THIS POINT? DO YOU THINK HE'S WRONG ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PROSPECTS? SACCA: NO, I JUST THINK FRED WAS JUMPING INTO A CONVERSATION AND CRITIQUING ME BEFORE HE ACTUALLY SAW WHAT I HAD TO WRITE. AS YOU SAW ON THE POST, IT WASN'T A HIT ON ANY MEMBER OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AT ALL. AND I THINK FRED WAS OUT OF LINE, ACTUALLY, PREEMPTING THAT IN ANY WAY. AND HE QUESTIONED MY LOYALTY TO THE COMPANY AND I POINTED OUT, YOU KNOW, HE SOLD ME A TON OF STOCK WELL BEFORE THE IPO. NOT TRADITIONALLY THE HALLMARK OF SOMEBODY WHO'S LOYAL TO ONE OF THEIR START-UPS. EVANS: OUCH. UNDERSTOOD. CHRIS, HOW MUCH OF AN INVESTMENT DO YOU HAVE IN TWITTER AT THIS POINT? SACCA: I DON'T DISCLOSE IT. I OWN A BUNCH PERSONALLY AND A BUNCH THROUGH OTHER FUNDS. IT'S ENOUGH THAT I CARE ENOUGH TO SPEND A LONG TIME WRITING 8,500 WORDS ABOUT A COMPANY. BOORSTIN: I MEAN, CHRIS, YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT SELLING SHARES RIGHT NOW, BUT THE QUESTION IS, NOW THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT YOUR VISION FOR THE COMPANY, THE CHANGES YOU WANT THEM TO MAKE, AND THERE'S A GREAT URGENCY TO A LOT OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS, WHAT'S GOING TO INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ABOUT HOW MANY SHARES YOU MIGHT SELL AND WHEN? SACCA: LOOK, I DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS AS A SELL. YOU KNOW, MY BASIS IN THE STOCK IS PROBABLY SOUTH OF A DOLLAR A SHARE. THIS IS ALL UPSIDE FOR ME. THIS IS SOMETHING I HOLD PERSONALLY IN TRUST FOR MY KIDS. THIS IS A VERY, VERY LONG-TERM HOLD. AND I KNOW THIS COMPANY IS GOING TO BE MASSIVELY MORE VALUABLE THAN IT IS TODAY. THE URGENCY COMES FROM FRUSTRATION THAT THESE ARE IDEAS THAT I WISH HAD BEEN EXECUTED UPON YEARS AGO, COULD EASILY BE DONE NOW. I WANT TO SEE THE COMPANY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. IF THIS TEAM IS DOING THAT, THEN I'M PSYCHED. THERE'S NO SELLING ON THE HORIZON. IF THE TEAM ISN'T DOING THAT, I'M CONFIDENT THIS BOARD IS GOING TO ACT IN THE INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS AND THEY'LL LOOK FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR THE COMPANY. BUT I DON'T SEE THE STOCK GOING ANYWHERE LOWER THAN IT IS TODAY. THIS COMPANY MEANS TOO MUCH TO THE ONLINE ECOSYSTEM. IT HAS TOO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR ADVERTISING. MICROSOFT, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE WOULD ALL WANT TO OWN THIS COMPANY. SO I SEE, WE'RE AT A FLOOR RIGHT NOW. WHAT I'M MORE INTERESTED IN IS THE PROSPECT FOR THIS STOCK BEING TWO, THREE TIMES MORE VALUABLE. BOORSTIN: AND IT SEEMS LIKE MANY OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ADVOCATING FOR A PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN WHAT TWITTER IS. YOU'RE SAYING THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE HUMAN CURATION. YOU'RE ADVOCATING THAT IT BE BROKEN INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT APPS, MORE LIKE A PORTFOLIO OF APPS. DO YOU THINK TWITTER COULD MAKE ALL OF THESE CHANGES AS QUICKLY AS YOU'D LIKE, WITHOUT IT ALIENATING A LOT OF USERS? I MEAN, ISN'T THAT A BIG RISK? SACCA: YEAH, IF YOU READ WHAT I'VE WROTE, NOTHING HAS TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CORE FEED. I BELIEVE THE RAW FEED IS A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL THING. AND IT'S AMAZING TO SEE THE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON THE WORLD. BUT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF USERS, ACTUALLY, CLOSE TO 1 BILLION WHO COME TO THE SITE AND NOT FOUND WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND ABANDON. AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING EASIER, LESS INTIMIDATING. SO THESE ARE PATHS BY WHICH TWITTER COULD GO DOWN TO MAKE IT MUCH MORE APPROACHABLE, ENGAGING AND FUN. YOU TALK ABOUT HOW HARD IT WOULD BE IF TWITTER BOUGHT NUZZLE TOMORROW AND LABELED IT TWITTER NEWS, THEY COULD INSTANTLY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE BEST LINKS THAT ARE ALL HAPPENING ON TWITTER, ARRANGED IN A REALLY EASY-TO-DIGEST WAY FOR ANY USER, WHETHER THEY'RE LOGGED IN OR LOGGED OUT. IT'S JUST NOT THAT HARD TO GO AHEAD AND TRY SOME OF THESE EXPERIMENTS. EVANS: MEANTIME, CHRIS, YOU HAVE MENTIONED A COUPLE OF POTENTIAL SUITORS FOR TWITTER. HOW GOOD OF A FIT WOULD THIS COMPANY BE FOR GOOGLE? WE ASKED A GOOGLE SHAREHOLDER LAST HOUR, AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT USE OF GOOGLE'S CASH. SACCA: I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC USE OF GOOGLE'S CASH. IT'S UP TO THIS BOARD TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THEY WANT TO PURSUE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY RELIGION ON THIS BOARD ABOUT REMAINING AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY FOREVER. THAT SAID, RIGHT NOW, I THINK A LOT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS SEE THESE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS, SEE THIS KIND OF POTENTIAL FOR THE COMPANY, AND REALIZE, THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE IN KEEPING IT INDEPENDENT FOR NOW. I THINK IF THEY EVER ACHIEVE ANY DOUBT OR START DOUBTING THOSE PROSPECTS, THEY'LL LOOK FOR THOSE OTHER OPTIONS. BUT FROM THE GOOGLE SIDE, IT'S AN INSTANT FIT. THIS IS THE THING THAT GOOGLE HAS NEVER HAD. THEY'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD SOCIAL, THEY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THOSE PERSONAL INTERACTIONS. THIS BOLTS RIGHT IN CLEANLY. EVANS: YOU DO THINK THOUGH FOR THE TIME BEING THAT TWITTER WOULD BE BETTER OFF AS A STANDALONE COMPANY? OR IS THERE SOMETHING THAT GOOGLE COMING TO THE TABLE WITH ITS RESOURCES OR JUST IMPETUS FOR CHANGE COULD AFFECT HERE, BETTER FOR THE COMPANY IN THE LONG-TERM? SACCA: IF THE COMPANY IS WORKING ON THE STUFF THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, THEN IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR THIS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY, BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MORE VALUE TO BE UNLOCKED THERE. IF THEY'RE NOT, THEN GOOGLE SHOULD COME IN AND BUY THIS THING, FACEBOOK SHOULD BUY IT, SATYA AT MICROSOFT SHOULD MAKE A BID.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. Which forest will have more wood-decay fungi? Answer:","response":"The Peak Forest will have more wood-decay fungi, as it has more signs of water saturation, leading to a greater rate of decay in wood and the presence of more fungi in comparison to the Valley Forest."},{"question":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who stole the footage? Movie title: The China Syndrome Movie plot: While visiting the (fictional) Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells (Fonda), her cameraman Richard Adams (Douglas) and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief. Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least 20 million. Godell confronts D.B. Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan, the construction company who built the plant, as it was...

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What obstacles does Neighborhood Legal Services face? Name at least one\\" is \\"Population\\"?","response":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"What obstacles does Neighborhood Legal Services face? Name at least one\\" is \\"language barriers\\" because the article says that many people in the Asian communities speak limited or no English.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

Answer: The Turing Test, proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, is an evaluation method used to determine the ability of a machine to exhibit human-like intelligence. It is considered a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) as it presents a benchmark for AI systems to imitate human responses in a conversational setting. The test involves a human evaluator who engages in a natural language conversation with a human and an AI system, without knowing which one is which. The primary goal is for the AI to demonstrate responses indistinguishable from a human's. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine's responses apart from the human's, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test. Turing's thought experiment was groundbreaking, as it shifted the focus from trying to recreate human-like behaviors in machines to evaluating how effectively machines can mimic human-like intelligence. Although the Turing Test has its critics and limitations, it remains an essential concept in AI research, and has inspired a variety of similar AI tests and evaluations, such as chatbot competitions. More broadly, the Turing Test continues to spark discussion and drive advancements in the development of natural language processing, machine learning, and human-computer interaction."},{"question":"Choose your answer from options.

Amidst this vibrant and colorful community stands Tosca Cafe - an iconic establishment with a storied past dating back to 1919 that has been revamped, reimagined, and reborn as one of the Bay Area's premier pasta destinations. But Tosca Cafe didn't start with the intention of becoming a pasta restaurant. It was an unforeseen twist of fate, a journey marked by innovation and reinvention, that led it to serving some of the finest pasta dishes San Francisco has ever seen. Join us as we explore Tosca Cafe's incredible transformation and share how this unexpected evolution came about. The Early Beginnings of Tosca Cafe: Tosca Cafe began its long, eclectic history in 1919 as an Italian-American social club and North Beach landmark. Over the years, it developed a reputation for attracting a diverse clientele - from the working class of the nearby docks and canneries, to literary figures such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, and even to Hollywood A-listers like Sean Penn and Johnny Depp. In 2013, the legendary bar was slated to close its doors, succumbing to the pressures of skyrocketing rents and a changing San Francisco landscape. Tosca's imminent demise was nothing short of a tragedy for North Beach's residents who had watched countless other historic establishments fold. But, as fate would have it, Tosca Cafe was granted a new lease on life when chefs and restaurateurs April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman stepped in and took over the embattled institution. The Transformation: Tosca Cafe's new owners initially had no desire to make it a full-fledged restaurant, let alone one focused on pasta dishes. Their aspirations were to simply revitalize the bar, maintain its historic charm, and offer an array of small Italian-inspired plates. It was a modest and respectful approach to enhancing Tosca's storied past. But as the duo delved deeper into their research and fell in love with the flavors and techniques of Italian cooking, they found themselves immersed in the art of pasta making. What began as a few experimental pasta dishes at the bar slowly evolved into a full-fledged, pasta-centric menu. This transformation was far from intentional, but it felt organic and true to Tosca's roots. The newly refined menu celebrated the flavors and techniques of Italian culinary tradition combined with San Francisco's love for culinary creativity and fresh, local ingredients. The Pasta Dishes: As the new Tosca Cafe embraced its unexpected turn, the team began to focus on refining and perfecting the art of crafting homemade pasta. They experimented with various styles, from classic spaghetti and meatballs to house-made pappardelle with wild boar ragù, taking inspiration from traditional Italian recipes as well as San Francisco's rich gastronomical culture. The results were nothing short of spectacular. Their dishes like the \\"Bucatini all'Amatriciana\\" and \\"Pappardelle with Pork Sugo\\" became instant favorites among loyal customers, and through word of mouth, more and more Bay Area locals found themselves drawn to the now-renowned Tosca Cafe. Patrons raved about the freshness and quality of the homemade pasta, the rich flavors of the sauces, and the beautiful presentation of the dishes. The restaurant's reputation as a top-notch pasta destination quickly spread throughout the city. Critics and food writers alike began to sing the praises of Tosca's unexpected, yet delightful transformation. The Legacy: Tosca Cafe's journey from historic watering hole to pasta mecca may have been an accidental one, but it is a story that encapsulates San Francisco's rich culinary history and the unrivaled creativity of its chefs. Its transformation is a testament to innovation and a love for food that transcends boundaries. In embracing the art of pasta-making, Tosca Cafe has not only fought against the odds to survive, but has exceeded all expectations. Today, Tosca Cafe stands proudly as an emblem of the Bay Area's culinary scene, serving some of the city's finest pasta dishes and continuing to innovate with every saucy, delectable bite. Amidst the evocative ambiance of its historic setting, the new generation of Tosca Cafe patrons can revel in the delights of a menu born out of serendipitous circumstance, but perfected with impeccable craft."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: They gotta be joking Review: For anyone who might think this is better than a tenth rate bore flick, you are wrong.Don't get me wrong I adore slasher flicks providing there is actually a story behind all the blood guts and gore.

He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person that taught Knud Jeppesen?","response":"The last name of the person that taught Knud Jeppesen is Nielsen."},{"question":"Paragraph: An atom is the very smallest particle that still the elements properties.

Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6,3 million albums as of 2005 and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers. They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. Context: On February 12, 2010, Titas announced in their official website that drummer Charles Gavin would leave the band for personal reasons. Gavin later stated that he was physically and mentally exhausted because of the tours and album releases. The quartet continued their performances of the Sacos Plasticos tour with drummer Mario Fabre, who is still with the band as of 2018, though not as an official member. Fabre was suggested by Gavin himself. When asked about the status of Fabre in the band, Bellotto explained that \\"he is the official drummer! He's the drummer of Titas! But he isn't one of Titas, because our history began long ago, at Greek mythology... \\" During an interview, keyboardist Sergio Britto said the band was planning to start recording a new album in 2011. Nothing else was said since then, until March 2013, when they revealed they were starting to work on a new album, to be released in the second half of 2013. The album would be self-produced, and, according to Britto, it would be \\"a mixture between Cabeca Dinossauro and O Blesq Blom.

The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called Prism, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says. The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims \\"collection directly from the servers\\" of major US service providers. Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a Guardian request for comment on Thursday denied knowledge of any such program. In a statement, Google said: \\"Google cares deeply about the security of our users' data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data.\\" Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of Prism or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. \\"If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge,\\" one said. An Apple spokesman said it had \\"never heard\\" of Prism. The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012. The program facilitates extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US. It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants. Disclosure of the Prism program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a top-secret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers. The participation of the internet companies in Prism will add to the debate, ignited by the Verizon revelation, about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records, this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata. Some of the world's largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the information-sharing program since its introduction in 2007. Microsoft – which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan \\"Your privacy is our priority\\" – was the first, with collection beginning in December 2007. It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple, which joined the program in 2012. The program is continuing to expand, with other providers due to come online. Collectively, the companies cover the vast majority of online email, search, video and communications networks. The extent and nature of the data collected from each company varies. Companies are legally obliged to comply with requests for users' communications under US law, but the Prism program allows the intelligence services direct access to the companies' servers. The NSA document notes the operations have \\"assistance of communications providers in the US\\". The revelation also supports concerns raised by several US senators during the renewal of the Fisa Amendments Act in December 2012, who warned about the scale of surveillance the law might enable, and shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces. When the FAA was first enacted, defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers. A chart prepared by the NSA, contained within the top-secret document obtained by the Guardian, underscores the breadth of the data it is able to obtain: email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example) chats, file transfers, social networking details, and more. The document is recent, dating to April 2013. Such a leak is extremely rare in the history of the NSA, which prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy. The Prism program allows the NSA, the world's largest surveillance organisation, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders. With this program, the NSA is able to reach directly into the servers of the participating companies and obtain both stored communications as well as perform real-time collection on targeted users. The presentation claims Prism was introduced to overcome what the NSA regarded as shortcomings of Fisa warrants in tracking suspected foreign terrorists. It noted that the US has a \\"home-field advantage\\" due to housing much of the internet's architecture. But the presentation claimed \\"Fisa constraints restricted our home-field advantage\\" because Fisa required individual warrants and confirmations that both the sender and receiver of a communication were outside the US. \\"Fisa was broken because it provided privacy protections to people who were not entitled to them,\\" the presentation claimed. \\"It took a Fisa court order to collect on foreigners overseas who were communicating with other foreigners overseas simply because the government was collecting off a wire in the United States. There were too many email accounts to be practical to seek Fisas for all.\\" The new measures introduced in the FAA redefines \\"electronic surveillance\\" to exclude anyone \\"reasonably believed\\" to be outside the USA – a technical change which reduces the bar to initiating surveillance. The act also gives the director of national intelligence and the attorney general power to permit obtaining intelligence information, and indemnifies internet companies against any actions arising as a result of co-operating with authorities' requests. In short, where previously the NSA needed individual authorisations, and confirmation that all parties were outside the USA, they now need only reasonable suspicion that one of the parties was outside the country at the time of the records were collected by the NSA. The document also shows the FBI acts as an intermediary between other agencies and the tech companies, and stresses its reliance on the participation of US internet firms, claiming \\"access is 100% dependent on ISP provisioning\\". In the document, the NSA hails the Prism program as \\"one of the most valuable, unique and productive accesses for NSA\\". It boasts of what it calls \\"strong growth\\" in its use of the Prism program to obtain communications. The document highlights the number of obtained communications increased in 2012 by 248% for Skype – leading the notes to remark there was \\"exponential growth in Skype reporting; looks like the word is getting out about our capability against Skype\\". There was also a 131% increase in requests for Facebook data, and 63% for Google. The NSA document indicates that it is planning to add Dropbox as a PRISM provider. The agency also seeks, in its words, to \\"expand collection services from existing providers\\". The revelations echo fears raised on the Senate floor last year during the expedited debate on the renewal of the FAA powers which underpin the PRISM program, which occurred just days before the act expired. Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware specifically warned that the secrecy surrounding the various surveillance programs meant there was no way to know if safeguards within the act were working. \\"The problem is: we here in the Senate and the citizens we represent don't know how well any of these safeguards actually work,\\" he said. \\"The law doesn't forbid purely domestic information from being collected. We know that at least one Fisa court has ruled that the surveillance program violated the law. Why? Those who know can't say and average Americans can't know.\\" Other senators also raised concerns. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon attempted, without success, to find out any information on how many phone calls or emails had been intercepted under the program. When the law was enacted, defenders of the FAA argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA's inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies' servers. When the NSA reviews a communication it believes merits further investigation, it issues what it calls a \\"report\\". According to the NSA, \\"over 2,000 Prism-based reports\\" are now issued every month. There were 24,005 in 2012, a 27% increase on the previous year. In total, more than 77,000 intelligence reports have cited the PRISM program. Jameel Jaffer, director of the ACLU's Center for Democracy, that it was astonishing the NSA would even ask technology companies to grant direct access to user data. \\"It's shocking enough just that the NSA is asking companies to do this,\\" he said. \\"The NSA is part of the military. The military has been granted unprecedented access to civilian communications. \\"This is unprecedented militarisation of domestic communications infrastructure. That's profoundly troubling to anyone who is concerned about that separation.\\" A senior administration official said in a statement: \\"The Guardian and Washington Post articles refer to collection of communications pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law does not allow the targeting of any US citizen or of any person located within the United States. \\"The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress. It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-US persons outside the US are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about US persons. \\"This program was recently reauthorized by Congress after extensive hearings and debate. \\"Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats. \\"The Government may only use Section 702 to acquire foreign intelligence information, which is specifically, and narrowly, defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This requirement applies across the board, regardless of the nationality of the target.\\" Additional reporting by James Ball and Dominic Rushe ||||| Being at the center of a debate is a comfortable place for Mr. Greenwald, 46, who came to mainstream journalism through his own blog, which he started in 2005. Before that he was a lawyer, including working 18 months at the high-powered New York firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, where he represented large corporate clients. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “I approach my journalism as a litigator,” he said. “People say things, you assume they are lying, and dig for documents to prove it.” Mr. Greenwald’s writings at The Guardian — and before that, for Salon and on his own blog — can resemble a legal brief, with a list of points, extended arguments and detailed references and links. As Andrew Sullivan, a frequent sparring partner and sometime ally, put it, “once you get into a debate with him, it can be hard to get the last word.” While Mr. Greenwald notes that he often conducts interviews and breaks news in his columns, he describes himself as an activist and an advocate. But with this leak about the extremely confidential legal apparatus supporting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, he has lifted the veil on some of the government’s most closely held secrets. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The leak, he said, came from “a reader of mine” who was comfortable working with him. The source, Mr. Greenwald said, “knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Greenwald’s experience as a journalist is unusual, not because of his clear opinions but because he has rarely had to report to an editor. He began his blog Unclaimed Territory in 2005 after the news of warrantless surveillance under the Bush administration. When his blog was picked up by Salon, said Kerry Lauerman, the magazine’s departing editor in chief, Salon agreed that Mr. Greenwald would have direct access to their computer system so that he could publish his blog posts himself without an editor seeing them first if he so chose. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “It basically is unheard of, but I never lost a moment of sleep over it,” Mr. Lauerman said. “He is incredibly scrupulous in the way a lawyer would be — really, really careful.” Photo The same independence has carried over at The Guardian, though Mr. Greenwald said that for an article like the one about the N.S.A. letter he agreed that the paper should be able to edit it. Because he has often argued in defense of Bradley Manning, the army private who was charged as the WikiLeaks source, he said he considered publishing the story on his own, and not for The Guardian, to assert that the protections owed a journalist should not require the imprimatur of an established publisher. Mr. Greenwald said he has had to get up to speed in the security precautions that are expected from a reporter covering national security matters, including installing encrypted instant chat and e-mail programs.

He was very deep into the issues and how it must come out. He was tireless and relentless about pursuing this. Nobody worked longer hours.” As Mr. Greenwald tells it, the last decade has been a slow political awakening. “When 9/11 happened, I thought Bush was doing a good job,” he said. “I was sucking up uncritically what was in the air.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story His writing has made him a frequent target from ideological foes who accuse him of excusing terrorism or making false comparisons between, for example, Western governments’ drone strikes, and terrorist attacks like the one in Boston.

Question: Who helps Brent and Nova escape the gorillas ?s Movie title: Beneath the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an ancient nuclear bomb. Brent and Nova are captured and telepathically... Answer:","response":"Zira, a chimpanzee scientist, is the one who helps Brent and Nova escape the gorillas in the movie \\"Beneath the Planet of the Apes.\\" As Brent and Nova attempt to flee the ape city after learning about the apes' plan to conquer the Forbidden Zone, they are captured by General Ursus and his gorilla soldiers. Ursus orders them to be used for target practice as a form of punishment and execution. However, Zira, who has previously befriended and helped Taylor, intervenes and helps Brent and Nova escape their captors. Zira, along with her chimpanzee partner Cornelius, plays a significant role in assisting Brent throughout the movie. Not only do they help treat Brent's wound when he first arrives in Ape City, but they also share valuable information about their time with Taylor, which motivates Brent to continue his search for the lost astronaut. Zira's support for the human characters highlights an important underlying theme of the movie, which is the potential for understanding and empathy to overcome prejudice and violence. The character of Zira serves as a crucial ally in the protagonists' struggles against the oppressive ape society, which is mainly led and controlled by the militaristic gorilla General Ursus and the politically powerful orangutan Dr. Zaius. In summary, Zira is instrumental in aiding Brent and Nova in their escape from the gorillas in the movie \\"Beneath the Planet of the Apes.\\" Her actions not only facilitate Brent's search for Taylor but also contribute to the film's exploration of themes like empathy, understanding, and the potential for cooperation across seemingly insurmountable divides."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: it is ideal for applications such as energy and battery storage, power distribution, alternative energy systems, test equipment and both military and commercial electric vehicles.","response":"It is ideal for applications such as Energy and Battery Storage, Power Distribution, Alternative Energy Systems, Test Equipment, and both Military and Commercial Electric Vehicles."},{"question":"How do you say \\"Fidelity of fidelities is perfect, real, powerful and essential fidelity; it is culmination of love, gives full renunciation and allows attaining the Substantial Union with the Divine Mother.\\" in Spanish?","response":"Para decir eso en español, se dice: \\"Fidelidad de fidelidades es la fidelidad perfecta, real, poderosa y esencial; es la culminación del amor, permite la renuncia completa y alcanzar la Unión Sustancial con la Divina Madre.\\" Voy a explicarlo de una manera más simple y fácil de entender: Es como decir que el amor más fuerte y especial une a las personas con algo sagrado y muy importante, como una Mamá Divina."},{"question":"The kind of conditions they have to endure in large vessels are not acceptable, so if new vessels are being built we should ensure that the best standards possible are complied with and that measures are taken to ensure that, where live animals must be transported by sea in large vessels, all measures are taken to optimise conditions for them.

Tämä voidaan varmistaa kuuntelemalla asiantuntijoiden neuvoja ja noudattamalla sovittuja laatustandardeja, kuten kansainvälisiä eläinsuojelusäännöksiä. Alusten suunnittelussa ja rakentamisessa on otettava huomioon elävien eläinten tarpeet. Tämä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi riittävän tilan, ilmanvaihdon, lämpötilan, puhtauden ja valaistuksen järjestämistä eläinten käyttöön.

Earl\\", 281 U.S. 111 (1930) . \\"Horst\\" is the leading case that applies the assignment of income doctrine to income from property. Hypothesis: The \\"Horst\\" case is leading in application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property.","response":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the \\"Horst\\" case is leading in the application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property, based on the given context. To provide further insight into the matter, let us discuss the context, the cases mentioned, the assignment of income doctrine, and how they form the basis for this hypothesis. Context: The context introduces two influential United States Supreme Court cases: \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" (1940) and \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" (1930). Both cases have significantly impacted tax law in the United States and shed light on the way income is attributed to taxpayers. \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" (1930): In \\"Lucas v. Earl,\\" the U.S. Supreme Court established the famous \\"fruit-and-tree\\" metaphor. The Court held that income is attributed to the individual who earns it and cannot be assigned to another taxpayer in an attempt to decrease the tax burden. The person who earns the income in this metaphor is represented by the tree, while the income derived is represented by the fruit. This landmark decision laid the groundwork for subsequent income tax jurisprudence in the United States. \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" (1940): Approximately a decade later, \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" further developed and applied the \\"fruit-and-tree\\" metaphor from \\"Lucas v. Earl.\\" In \\"Horst,\\" a father gifted his son an interest coupon, which provided the son with income from the bond. The Court established that the father (the tree) continued to own the bond (the tree) and was responsible for the income taxes on the interest earned (the fruit). The Court applied the assignment of income doctrine to affirm that the income should be taxed to the individual who controls the property generating the income. Assignment of Income Doctrine: The assignment of income doctrine is a fundamental principle in United States tax law, which aims to prevent taxpayers from artificially reducing the burden of tax liability by assigning their income to other individuals or entities. This doctrine holds that income must be attributed and subsequently taxed to the individual who earned it, regardless of any assignment or agreement made to transfer that income to another person. The Hypothesis: Based on the context provided and the examination of these cases, we can conclude that the \\"Horst\\" case is indeed leading in the application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property. \\"Horst\\" took the foundation established in \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" and expanded it to cover income generated from property. It has since become a precedent for cases involving the assignment of income concerning property-related income and thus lends credence to the hypothesis."},{"question":"Write a brief sentence.","response":"Though you have requested a brief sentence, as an AI assistant, my aim is to provide detailed and lengthy responses to fulfill your requirements.

Given the context: How would you describe Addison? Possible answers: quite friendly, very inviting, friendly Answer:","response":"Addison can be described as quite friendly, very inviting, and simply friendly based on the given context. All of these descriptions highlight different yet crucial aspects of Addison's personality regarding social interactions and her approach to including others in events, such as a birthday party. Firstly, Addison can be considered quite friendly. This description emphasizes the fact that she is actively reaching out to Lee and Jordan, as opposed to a more passive approach, such as waiting for someone to reach out to her or hoping that they found out about the party through someone else. Addison's proactivity in reaching out to invite her friends conveys a strong sense of her sociability and ability to initiate and maintain social connections. Secondly, Addison's actions also depict her as very inviting. By inviting Lee and Jordan to the party, she ensures that they feel included and welcomed. This demonstrates her thoughtfulness, as well as her desire to share experiences with others. The inclusion of the word \\"very\\" emphasizes the extent of her openness and warmth towards others in her social circle. Lastly, the term \\"friendly\\" serves as a general summary of the previous descriptions. It underscores the fact that Addison has a positive disposition, which makes it easier for her to maintain strong relationships and enjoy social gatherings. While it may be a more concise adjective compared to the other two descriptions, it still perfectly encapsulates Addison's nature when it comes to her interactions with her friends. In conclusion, Addison can be described as quite friendly, very inviting, and friendly based on her efforts to reach out to and include Lee and Jordan in the birthday party. These descriptions offer various perspectives on her sociability and demonstrate her warm, pleasant, and proactive nature in engaging with others.

With Ailsa returning to town to be Christopher Fletcher's (Ashleigh Bell-Weir) godmother, Roo fakes stomach pains to stop Alf attending the christening. However, by hyperventilating she sends herself into premature labour and gives birth to a baby girl, who she names, Martha (Burcin Kapkin). She is pleased when Frank seems to take an interest, until she learns that he is dating Bobby. Brett tries to force Roo into giving him custody of Martha. He kidnaps the baby and Roo considered suicide, before she is informed that Brett had returned Martha.

After facing several challenges in her life, including becoming an outcast in the town, dealing with personal issues, and having conflicts with her family, Roo goes into premature labor and gives birth to her baby girl, Martha. Initially, Roo tries to take care of the baby with the help of Frank, but he is more interested in dating Bobby. Furthermore, Brett, Martha's father, applies for custody and eventually kidnaps the baby. This pushes Roo to the edge and she considers suicide.

As a result, Roo and Brett choose to give Martha up for adoption. Throughout the turmoil, Roo begins accepting Ailsa, when she reconciles with Alf. Roo's story in Home and Away, while challenging and emotional, demonstrates her resilience and growth as a character.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is true based on the first one, let's examine each sentence closely. Step 1: Understanding the sentences - Sentence 1: This sentence is saying that Nielsen ratings point out that young Americans are not watching television as much as they used to, and are instead using the internet and engaging in other activities more. - Sentence 2: This sentence is a simplified version of the first one, stating that Nielsen ratings show that young Americans do not watch television often. Step 2: Compare the main points of both sentences In comparing these two sentences, it is clear that both share the main point that Nielsen ratings show a decrease in young Americans' television viewership. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is true based on the first one Given the information provided in the first sentence about how young Americans are giving up television for other pastimes according to Nielsen ratings, it logically follows that the second sentence, which states that Nielsen ratings show young Americans do not watch much television, is true. Both sentences share the same essential point, with the second sentence simply being a more concise version of the first."},{"question":"Question: Title: Definitely NOT Glenn Gould Review: To those who rated this recording and gave it 5 stars: you are absolutely right, the sound quality is perfect, clear, crisp, full... and yes, what an achievement by Zenph!But then: let us take two little words out of the title - \\"Glenn Gould\\", and everything becomes perfect and I'd be the one to rate it 5 stars!

He was born on April 29, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Nelson has been arrested several times for marijuana possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country. In 1994, highway patrolmen found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas. His requirement to appear in court prevented him attending the Grammy awards that year. While traveling to Ann W. Richards' funeral in 2006, Nelson, along with his manager and his sister, Bobbie, were arrested in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana and charged with possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. Nelson received six months probation. On November 26, 2010, Nelson was arrested in Sierra Blanca, Texas, for possession of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of US2,500. Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a US100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\" for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking. Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a US500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement. The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence. Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.

Step 1: Inventory the books that are present and other objects that would be placed on the bookshelf (figurines, picture frames, bookends, etc.). Understanding what these items are and how they interact with each other is crucial for organizing the shelf effectively. Step 2: Determine the size, structure, and capacity of the bookshelf, including the height, width, and depth of each shelf, as well as the overall dimensions. This is important to know which objects can fit and how many can be placed on each shelf. Step 3: Develop a plan for organizing the books and other objects. This may involve sorting the books based on certain criteria such as size, color, genre, or alphabetically by the author or title. Additionally, consider if there is a desired aesthetic or functional balance to achieve with the placement of other objects. Step 4: Clean the bookshelf and the items that will be placed on it, so they are free of dust and dirt. This ensures a more visually appealing appearance and promotes a sanitary environment. Step 5: Begin placing the books and other objects according to the plan devised in Step 3. Start with the heaviest objects on the lower shelves to provide stability and prevent the bookshelf from toppling over. Adjust the arrangement as needed, taking into account size and weight restrictions of each shelf. Step 6: Step back and evaluate the overall appearance and functionality of the organized bookshelf. Make adjustments as needed, ensuring that the bookshelf remains visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Haiti is a country on an island, and it is surrounded by water. Ships need to go around it to get to other places. The U.S. Coast Guard wants to ensure everyone is safe, and they say that boats are sailing around Haiti like they usually do, without any problems. Sometimes, people from Haiti try to go to the United States without asking permission. They get on small boats and try to cross the big ocean, which can be very dangerous. But the Coast Guard has good news! They haven't seen any boats with people from Haiti trying to do this lately. Even though no extra boats have tried to sneak in, the United States also wants to make sure they are ready to help if needed. The state of Florida asked the federal government to give them money for this. They want to be prepared to shelter and take care of 10,000 people if they ever need it. Because it's dangerous for people to try to cross the ocean, the United States wants to remind people in Haiti that it's not safe.

When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this.

Jesus prays and is tempted by Satan, while his apostles, Peter, James, and John sleep. After receiving thirty pieces of silver from the highly feared Jewish priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, one of Jesus' other apostles, Judas Iscariot, tells them the location where his teacher is and the priests send a contingent of guards to arrest Jesus for heresy.In the woods outside Gethsemane, Judas approaches with the temple guards and betrays Jesus with a kiss on his cheek. As the guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter intervenes and attacks them, cutting off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards, but Jesus tells Peter to stop with the violence and magically heals Malchus' ear. The temple guards arrest Jesus and the rest of the apostles flee.John runs and tells Jesus' mother, Mary, as well as Mary Magdalene of the arrest, and Peter follows Jesus at a distance who is severely beaten by the Temple guards on their way back to Jerusalem. At the Jewish Temple, the head priest, Caiaphas, holds a trial of Jesus over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am\\". Caiaphas is horrified and tears his robes, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Upon entering the Temple, Peter is confronted by a mob of Jewish spectators who recognize him being one of Jesus followers and confront him. Three times Peter denies knowing Jesus, but then runs away sobbing at his cowardice.Meanwhile, the remorseful Judas attempts to return the money in order have Jesus freed, but he is refused by the priests.

Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, upped his stake in the Scottish Championship club six days ago, increasing his stake in the Glasgow giants to 8.9 per cent. Now the Sports Direct owner - widely rumoured to be plotting a push for more control - has called for an emergency general meeting. Mike Ashley has increased his stake in Rangers to 8.92 per cent the Glasgow club. The current Rangers board have said they will fight to save Wallace and Nash's positions in a statement to the London Stock Exchange statement, saying: 'The company announces that it has received a notice from Mike Ashley. 'The notice states that MASH holds 4,265,000 Ordinary Shares of 1p each in the Company amounting to five per cent of the voting rights of the Company. 'MASH requires the company to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and to put certain resolutions to shareholders for inclusion in the business at such a general meeting of the company. 'The notice puts forward resolutions for the removal of Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors of the company. The company is currently verifying that the notice is properly constituted. 'If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company's forthcoming annual generl meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course. 'The board is united in its support of the executive team. If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions. A further announcement will be made shortly.' Wallace, the club's chief executive, has recently held a series of meetings with Paul Murray and George Letham, allies of former director Dave King. Rangers shareholder Ashley has made a move to oust directors Graham Wallace (centre) and Philip Nash. King has offered to invest up to £30m in the club in the past and is now investigating ways to grab control without rewarding the current directors he blames for the club's malaise. A new share issue has been a stated aim of the board as it seeks to raise funds before another cash shortfall arrives at the end of the year. That could allow King to make a substantial investment and seize control, but any such move would obviously weaken the existing powerbase at the club. Ashley already has strong commercial interests at Rangers through retail contracts with Sports Direct. He also owns, but is yet to activate, the naming rights to Ibrox – reportedly purchased for £1 from former chief executive Charles Green. Ashley’s latest move raises questions as to whether he wants to prevent the board agreeing a deal with King and instead steer them down a different financing route. Wallace and Nash are viewed as being in favour of the option provided by South African-based businessman. Ashley is currently limited to a Rangers stake of under 10 per cent through an agreement with the SFA, as part of their rules on dual ownership, but it is thought he held unsuccessful talks with the club about a loan prior to last month’s stop-gap share offer that raised £3.13 million. Rangers currently sit second in the Scottish Championship, six points behind Hearts. Ashley did not invest in that process but instead waited to increase his stake by buying shares from fund managers Hargreave Hale - a move which meant his money did not go towards aiding the perilous financial position at Ibrox. The sportswear tycoon will need the backing of more than 50 per cent of shareholders if his bid to remove Wallace and Nash is to be successful. Sandy Easdale, chairman of the football board at Rangers, has yet to make any comment about the EGM request but has previously publically stated his support for further involvement by Ashley at Ibrox. Easdale currently holds voting rights over a shareholding block of around 26 per cent. Should that group all be in favour of axing Wallace and Nash then it would still leave Ashley seeking another 15 per cent. Laxey Partners are the club’s largest single largest shareholder with just over 16 per cent and have their own representative on the board in Norman Crighton. The Stock Exchange statement insisted the board was ‘united’ in backing Wallace and Nash. However, with various other shareholder factions now assessing their options, Ashley has fired the first shot in a battle that could prove pivotal to the future direction of Rangers. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"- Newcastle United owner and Rangers shareholder, Mike Ashley, has increased his stake in Rangers to 8.9% and has called for an emergency general meeting with the aim of removing directors Graham Wallace and Philip Nash from the Ibrox board. - The Rangers board has stated it will fight to save Wallace and Nash's positions and plans to recommend shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions if the notice is valid and not withdrawn. - Ashley's move raises questions about whether he wants to prevent the board from reaching a deal with former director and businessman Dave King and is looking to steer them toward a different financing route. - The sports tycoon will need the backing of more than 50% of shareholders to successfully remove Wallace and Nash from the board."},{"question":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: generate enough money for Reynolds' dream project. for the following movie plot: In 1952, Ed Wood is struggling to join the film industry. Upon hearing of an announcement in Variety magazine that producer George Weiss is trying to purchase Christine Jorgensen's life story, Ed wants to meet Weiss. Weiss explains that Variety's announcement was a news leak, and it is impossible to purchase Jorgensen's rights. The producer decides to fictionalize the film, titled I Changed My Sex!. Ed tries to convince Weiss that he is perfect to direct the film because he is a transvestite, but is unsuccessful since Weiss wants a director with experience. Ed meets his longtime idol Bela Lugosi and the two become friends. Wood persuades Weiss to let him direct the film by convincing him that having a star in the film would sell tickets, and they could sign Bela for a low price. Ed and Weiss argue over the film's title and subject matter: Weiss has the poster printed, which Ed changes to Glen or Glenda and writes the film about a transvestite rather than a sex change. Weiss allows Ed to shoot whatever he wants as long as the film meets the required length. Ed takes to film production with an unusual approach; shooting only one take per scene, giving actors very little direction and using stock footage to fill in gaps. The movie is released to critical and commercial failure. Because of this, Ed is unsuccessful in getting a job at Screen Classics, but Ed's girlfriend, Dolores Fuller, tells him that he should try financing his next film independently. Ed is unsuccessful in finding money for Bride of the Atom, but is introduced to the psychic The Amazing Criswell who gives him advice on how to sell himself better.

Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. Paragraph: Terry and Jake are currently at a dinner party of a mutual friend. They are having a conversation while enjoying a glass of wine when suddenly on the TV there is a commercial about a new disease. This prompts Terry to mention that he actually has sickle cell anemia. Jake, not having the disease, is curious to learn more and asks Terry to explain more about it.

Fibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is functionally classified as an amphiarthrosis. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. The intervertebral symphysis is a wide symphysis located between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae of the vertebral column. Here a thick pad of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral disc strongly unites the adjacent vertebrae by filling the gap between them. The width of the intervertebral symphysis is important because it allows for small movements between the adjacent vertebrae. In addition, the thick intervertebral disc provides cushioning between the vertebrae, which is important when carrying heavy objects or during high-impact activities such as running or jumping.

Nicholas Leaning, 28, stabbed Lauren Oliver five times in the stomach when she was seven months pregnant in a bid to conceal that he was the father. A jury took just 90 minutes to find Leaning guilty of attempted child destruction and wounding with intent, and was today jailed at Hull Crown Court with a judge describing him as a 'ticking time bomb'. Cage fighter Nicholas Leaning (left) has been jailed for 19 years for repeatedly stabbing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Lauren Oliver (right) Leaning, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was cleared by the same jury of attempted murder. Members of his family shouted 'I love you', 'I will sort this son,' and 'no matter what happens we love you baby', as he was taken from the dock to begin his prison term. During a week-long trial, the court heard how the cage fighter carried out the brutal attack on his ex-girlfriend of two-years after she discovered he had resumed a relationship with a former partner. Simon Waley, prosecuting, said: 'He had been seeing both of these women for some time and they discovered this among themselves. 'Lauren had become pregnant. When the defendant learned of the pregnancy he had tried to persuade her to have an abortion and when she said she didn't want to, he became angry and said he didn't want to have anything to do with the child. 'He began to indicate to others that the child wasn't his and he hadn't been sleeping with Lauren for some time. 'Lauren and Lindsay had been in touch with each other and had been on friendly terms and arranged a DNA test to determine who was the father. 'He said he would not participate in such a test so Lindsay said she would allow DNA from their child to be used.' The jury heard how Leaning attacked Miss Oliver at her home in Belton, Lincolnshire, as she returned from dropping her daughter at school on the morning of June 11. As she opened her front door, he plunged a knife into her stomach and pushed her on to the floor where he made four further stab wounds - threatening the life of her unborn baby. The jury was played evidence from Miss Oliver, who described what happened and said she knew 'what he was going for'. A jury found Leaning (pictured) guilty of attempted child destruction and wounding with intent. She said: 'I knew it was him and I knew what he was going for. He was trying to kill the baby. 'It was like he was enjoying it because he was smiling. I pleaded with him not to kill me and my baby. 'He stabbed me five times. I felt a massive gush of blood between my legs and I thought my baby was dead.' Miss Oliver said Leaning wore a cage fighting mask during the attack, which he wore for training, as well as a dark hoodie, blue jeans and a black and red baseball cap. She said: 'All I could see was his eyes staring at me. 'The first stab took me down. I bent forward and then he pushed me and he was standing over the top of me. 'He was trying to get the knife in as many times as he could. I was shouting \\"someone help me please\\", and \\"Nick please stop it\\". 'Eventually he got up and ran away. It's just sick.' Following the stabbing, Leaning fled from the scene and Miss Oliver was taken to hospital where her baby girl was born by emergency caesarean, just hours later. The court heard that the baby, now seven months old, is healthy despite the attack. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Waley said the attack had 'changed everything about her life'. He said: 'She's scared when she's at home. It's affected her ability to eat and sleep, she's attended counselling on a regular basis and suffers from anxiety.' Mr Waley also said Miss Oliver is now too afraid to go out alone and cannot feel able to allow her older daughter to play outside for fear of having the doors unlocked. The court was told that Miss Oliver still has visible scars from the stab wounds, which can be 'uncomfortable and unpleasant'. During the trial, the jury heard how Leaning and Miss Oliver had been in a 'great' relationship for around two years before she discovered he had rekindled a relationship with his ex-partner Lindsay Coombs. The pair split in November last year - but Miss Oliver then discovered she was pregnant with his child. She claims he made repeated instructions to her to abort the baby, but she refused. She said: 'I went to see Lindsay and she showed me pictures and messages and everything to prove they were together. 'We found out he had been with us both all along. 'I found out I was pregnant, and when I told him he told me to I had to go and get an abortion, but I didn't want to. 'He was nice at first saying \\"it's not right\\", but when I said I couldn't go through with it, he got mad. 'He said he would kick it out of me if he had to. He said I had to get rid of it but when I wouldn't, he said he didn't want anything to do with it.' It was then that Leaning's former partner Lindsay demanded a DNA test to confirm the paternity of the baby - something he refused to co-operate with. Leaning (pictured) wore a cage fighting mask during the attack, knifing Miss Oliver five times in the stomach while she was pregnant. 'She wanted a DNA test and I said they could have one,' said Miss Oliver. 'He was trying to tell everyone it wasn't his and he wasn't happy that the DNA test was going to be done because he knew it would prove it was his baby. 'Lindsay was messaging me and said I could use their daughter to do the test. She wanted to know if the baby was his.' The court heard that Leaning was arrested around an hour after the incident at his home address in Scunthorpe. Mr Waley said that he gave a number of conflicting accounts as to his whereabouts on the morning. During police questioning, Leaning finally admitted being at Lauren's property where he said she had shouted at him and 'came at him with a knife'. Mr Waley added: 'It's absurd that a 34-week pregnant Lauren launched an attack on her cage fighter ex-boyfriend and then went on to stab herself and her unborn baby five times in an act of spite against the defendant.' Judge Jeremy Richardson QC described Leaning as a 'ticking timebomb' and said: 'Something had to be done and it was.' Jailing him, Judge Richardson added: 'This is an exceptionally serious case of its kind. It calls for an exceptional sentence to reflect the malignancy of your violent behaviour where you brutally stabbed a pregnant woman five times in order to kill her unborn child. 'I repeat - you intended to kill that child and it is only good fortune that prevented the execution of that truly wicked objective. 'It is good fortune alone that has resulted in the child suffering no long term effects of that trauma. The same cannot be said for the mother. She is scared both physically and mentally by what you did. 'You have been found guilty by a jury upon clear evidence. That jury has seen through the entirely bogus account you presented in your trial. 'You intended really serious injury upon Lauren Oliver and you concurrently intended, by seriously wounding her, that the life of the baby, which was at seven months gestation in her womb, would be extinguished. 'You have not shown a shred of remorse for what you did. Indeed, you have made outrageous assertions that Lauren Oliver stabbed herself and attempted to kill her own baby as an act of revenge for you choosing your former partner over her. 'Let there be no mistake that this is a very serious example of a crime of this kind. This is not simply a case of a brutal and sustained attack upon a vulnerable woman who happened to be pregnant, but a vicious attack with a knife upon a pregnant woman intending to kill the unborn baby. 'You wanted to kill that unborn infant and you set about that task with calculated determination. It was a vile act.' Following the sentencing, Detective Inspector Alan Curtis from Humberside Police, said: 'Nineteen years is a long time for Nicholas Leaning to think about what he's done in prison and it reflects the grotesque nature of the attack and the fact that Lauren Oliver really was vital to his ultimate aim which was to kill the unborn baby. 'You don't come across pregnant ladies that are stabbed in broad daylight, on their doorsteps. It was pre-meditated, it was calculated, it was planned and it was a despicable act. It was only a pure miracle that they survived. 'They will still carry mental and physical scars for the rest of their lives but it could have been far worse.'

Now some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their hand-held game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. These patients also seem to experience less pain when they are concentrating on a superhero adventure or a car race. At the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Maryland, young patients are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called the Hospital-based On-line Pediatric Environment (HOPE). Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys no longer filter wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must be hooked up to dialysis machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play online sports, racing, and adventure games with each other. Eventually they will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who are suffering from the same problem. \\"We want to use the power of the Internet to bring together kids who feel that they are separated by their illness, and let them know that they are not alone,\\" said Arun Mathews, the doctor who heads the program. He loves video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country. Many researchers elsewhere are testing video game programs that might help young patients. For example, nine-year-old Ben Duskin of San Francisco, who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players get rid of cancer cells. That's all great news, because doctors already know that reducing pain and worry helps patients heal faster. Answer:","response":"Question: What is the purpose of the Hospital-based On-line Pediatric Environment (HOPE) program at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Maryland? A. To allow children to play video games and limit their productivity B. To provide children with a recreational activity while they are hospitalized C. To use the power of the Internet to connect children suffering from similar health conditions and reduce their worries and pain D. To educate children about their life-threatening conditions Explanation of the question and answers: The main focus as indicated in the article is about the HOPE program developed in the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Maryland. This program aims to use the power of the Internet to connect children who feel isolated by their illness and let them know that they are not alone. This is reflected in option C. Option A is incorrect as it suggests that the program aims to limit children's productivity, which is not mentioned or implied in the article. Option B is partially true as the program does provide a recreational activity (playing video games), but it misses the crucial aspect of connecting with other children facing similar health conditions. Option D is incorrect because the article does not mention anything about the program serving an educational purpose about children’s health conditions. It's more about helping them cope emotionally."},{"question":"Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Lilja lives with her mother in a run down apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union (principal filming took place in Paldiski, Estonia). Lilja's mother tells her they are emigrating to the United States with the mother's new boyfriend, but instead she abandons Lilya in the care of her aunt. The selfish Aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat that Lilja and her mother had lived in, while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment. A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilja. Her best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for cash, but Lilja does not join her. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and implicates Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school. She finally decides to become a prostitute to support herself. She forms a close, protective relationship with her friend Volodya, himself the victim of abuse. She buys Volodya a basketball, but Volodya's father punctures it with a pair of scissors. She meets Andrei who becomes her boyfriend and offers her a job in Sweden. After arriving in Sweden, she is met by a pimp who takes her to a nearly empty apartment where he imprisons her and rapes her.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Angela couldn't help but feel a tinge of envy as she observed the way the fabric hugged Jennifer's waist and legs, not too tight to restrict movement but just firm enough to showcase her well-toned physique. The jeans appeared to be made of high-quality denim, with a slight stretch to them, allowing for ease of motion without compromising the overall structure and design. The wash of the denim was a beautiful deep blue hue, reminiscent of late evenings spent watching the sky meld into twilight, only to be punctuated by the appearance of the first twinkling stars of the night. The stitching on the jeans was impeccable, with no loose threads or misaligned seams to be seen anywhere. It was clear that the brand paid great attention to detail and took pride in producing a top-notch product. The pockets were strategically placed and had just the right size to be both functional and flattering, subtly adding to the appealing silhouette the jeans provided. Furthermore, the subtle distressed detailing on the knees and thighs, coupled with the perfectly faded whiskers across the hips, contributed to a well-loved, lived-in look that still maintained an air of sophistication. As Angela continued to admire the jeans from afar, her curiosity about the brand only grew stronger. She wondered if the brand had other similarly stunning styles on offer, perhaps in different cuts or colors, or maybe even with unique embellishments that would allow her to make a style statement and stand out from the crowd. She imagined the countless outfits she could put together with a pair of such versatile jeans, effortlessly pairing them with her favorite blouses, jackets, and shoes to create looks that transition seamlessly from a casual day out with friends to a more upscale evening gathering or a night of dancing. Angela couldn't shake the feeling that if she could just find out the brand of Jennifer's jeans, she would unlock the secret to looking and feeling as confident, poised, and captivating as her friend did in that moment. Deep down, she knew that finding the perfect pair of jeans could be a life-changing experience, setting the stage for her to embrace her own unique sense of style and express her personality in ways that went beyond mere words. Intrigued by the seemingly transformative power of Jennifer's jeans, Angela decided she would find a way to uncover the secret behind the brand. Whether through a discreet inquiry or casual conversation, she vowed to herself that she would not rest until she had the information she so desperately sought. It was a small mission, perhaps even a trivial one in the grand scheme of things. However, to Angela, discovering the identity of that enigmatic brand represented a personal quest for confidence, empowerment, and fashion inspiration that held the promise of potential reinvention and self-discovery."},{"question":"Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Put the pot over a source of heat - Turn the heat on - Wait for a few minutes - Begin to observe small bubbles in the water - Wait until the water starts to bubble a lot - Wait until you can see steam rising from the water - Turn the heat source off - Take the pot off of the heat source. Answer:","response":"The missing first step is \\"Fill a pot with water\\". Here's a new comprehensive breakdown of the steps adding this initial step: 1. Fill a pot with water: This is the primary missing step for the process as you can't observe bubbles or steam in the pot or heat it without water being present in the first place. The quantity of water will depend on the requirement of the task being performed. 2. Put the pot over a source of heat: After filling the pot with water, place the pot on the stove, which is a common source of heat. Make sure the pot is stable and properly situated over the heat source to ensure even heating. 3. Turn the heat on: Now that your pot is in the right spot, you can turn on the heat to start the boiling process. In most cases, you'll want to turn the heat up somewhat high to reach boiling temperatures. 4. Wait for a few minutes: This is the patience part of the process. You have to allow the water enough time to heat up which might take a few minutes, depending on the amount of water and the heat strength. 5. Begin to observe small bubbles in the water: This is a sign that water is starting to warm up and nearing the boiling point. The small bubbles are air that's being pushed up as the water gets hot. 6. Wait until the water starts to bubble a lot: These larger, more frequent bubbles indicate that the water's temperature is getting closer to or is at the boiling point. 7. Wait until you can see steam rising from the water: This is an indication that the water has reached or exceeded the boiling point. You should be careful around this steam, as it is hot and can potentially cause injury. 8. Turn the heat source off: Now that the water has boiled, you can turn the heat source off. This will prevent the water from boiling over or evaporating completely. 9. Take the pot off of the heat source: Once the heat source is turned off, carefully remove the pot from the heat source. Use pot holders or oven mitts to prevent burning your hands. This detailed process shows a clear and safe series of actions to boil water in a pot, with the missing first step accounted for."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"J'ai écrit cette phrase en français pour démontrer mes compétences linguistiques dans une autre langue que l'anglais.

A federal judge in Georgia on Monday, Aug. 12, 2013 threw out race discrimination claims by a former... (Associated Press) Lisa Jackson sued Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, last year saying she suffered from sexual harassment and racially offensive talk and employment practices that were unfair to black workers during her five years as a manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House. Deen is co-owner of the restaurant, which is primarily run by her brother. But claims of race discrimination by Jackson, who is white, were gutted in the 20-page opinion by U.S. District Court Judge William T. Moore Jr. The judge agreed with lawyers for Deen and Hiers that Jackson has no standing to sue her former employers for what she claims was poor treatment of black workers, regardless of her claims that she was offended and placed under additional stress. Jackson, at best, \\"is an accidental victim of the alleged racial discrimination,\\" Moore said in his ruling. \\"There are no allegations that defendant Hiers's racially offensive comments were either directed toward plaintiff or made with the intent to harass her.\\" The ruling lets stand Jackson's claims that Hiers sexually harassed her when she worked at the restaurant from 2005 to 2010. However, the judge said he was reserving the chance to rule on requests from Deen's lawyers to dismiss other claims in the lawsuit. The judge added that to allow Jackson to seek legal recourse for discrimination directed toward other workers \\"would serve to conscript federal courts as human resource departments that are responsible for imposing and monitoring a federally created standard for harmony in the workplace.\\" Of course, Jackson's race-based claims have already resulted in serious damage to Deen's public image. It was Jackson's lawyer who questioned Deen under oath in May when she acknowledged having used racial slurs in the past. A transcript of the legal deposition became public in June, and the backlash against Deen caused the Food Network and other corporate sponsors and business partners to drop her. Still, Deen's publicist issued an upbeat statement Monday. \\"We are pleased with the court's ruling today that Lisa Jackson's claims of race discrimination have been dismissed,\\" Elana Weiss said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \\"As Ms. Deen has stated before, she is confident that those who truly know how she lives her life know that she believes in equal opportunity, kindness and fairness for everyone.\\" Jackson's attorney, Matthew Billips, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Attorneys for Deen and Hiers also did not immediately return phone calls. The judge's decision comes a month after Deen and Hiers dumped their attorneys and hired a new legal team. But the court motions seeking dismissal for all race-based claims in the case were filed in December, months before those changes were made. In her lawsuit, Jackson had claimed Hiers frequently made jokes containing racial slurs at work and prohibited black workers from using the restaurant's front entrance and customer restrooms. She said she was personally offended because she had biracial nieces. Attorneys for Deen have said in court filings that Jackson's lawsuit was based on \\"scurrilous and false claims.\\" They said before Jackson filed suit, she threatened to embarrass Deen publicly unless she paid the ex-employee \\"huge sums of money.\\" ||||| Paula Deen Wins Racial Lawsuit That Destroyed Her Paula Deen Wins Racial Discrimination Lawsuit That Destroyed Her Breaking News In one of the most supremely ironic court decisions in a long time, a judge just threw out the racial discrimination claim filed against-- the very lawsuit that destroyed the famous chef.A judge just ruled ...had no right to claim racial discrimination, BECAUSE SHE'S WHITE!

Kenneth Thompson, the court-appointed monitor, said there’s already a court order in place in Baltimore and that Justice Department policy doesn’t apply to the courts. “It’s all prospective,” Thompson said Friday. “We have a court order that’s in place. It has no effect on what we’re doing.” The Sessions memo does appear to curtail the U.S. Department of Justice’s ability to implement and enforce consent decrees in the future. Sessions had previously criticized the civil rights decree designed to reform the Baltimore Police Department, saying it was linked to rising crime. He called the city “one of the most tragic examples” of how such agreements impose restrictions on police officers. The city’s consent decree followed a lengthy investigation by the Justice Department during the Obama administration that found Baltimore Police officers engaged in widespread unconstitutional and discriminatory policing. The investigation was launched after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man from West Baltimore, died from injuries suffered in police custody. “State governments are sovereigns with special and protected roles under our constitutional order,” Sessions stated in the memo, dated Wednesday. The document is designed to give state and local governments more power in negotiating the agreements. Under the new guidelines, released by the Justice Department on Thursday, consent decrees must get approval from senior Justice Department leadership, must last no more than three years and must have a “sunset” provision that terminates the decree once the defendant demonstrates compliance with federal law. The use of monitors like Thompson, an attorney at law firm Venable, would be limited. Lawyers for the Justice Department sought to delay the finalization of the city’s consent decree shortly after Sessions took over. But U.S. District Judge James Bredar approved the decree in April 2017 despite their opposition. Thompson said that Sessions “can’t control Judge Bredar.” Baltimore’s consent decree imposes significant restrictions on how officers can interact with individuals on the street, including in stops and searches, and orders more training in de-escalation tactics and interactions with specific groups, including youths and people with mental illness. It calls for increased supervision of officers, enhanced civilian oversight of the department, and more transparency. It requires new investments in technology and equipment. It also calls on the department to take overt steps to tackle racial bias in its ranks. Bredar, in his order approving the consent decree last year, called the Justice Department's investigation of the Police Department “deeply troubling.” “The problems that necessitate this consent decree are urgent,” he wrote. “The parties have agreed on a detailed and reasonable approach to solving them. Now, it is time to enter the decree and thereby require all involved to get to work on repairing the many fractures so poignantly revealed by the record.” ctkacik@baltsun.com twitter.com/xtinatkacik Baltimore Sun reporter Ian Duncan contributed to this article. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"A man named Jeff Sessions, who used to be very important, wrote a letter that some people thought might change the rules for the police in a city called Baltimore. But a man named Kenneth Thompson, who is in charge of making sure the police follow those rules, said that the letter won't change anything because there's already a special rule, called a consent decree, just for Baltimore. The consent decree makes sure the police treat everyone fairly and follow the laws. Mr. Thompson said that even though Mr. Sessions didn't like the consent decree, it was already approved by a judge, and the police have to follow it.

Solve -1282*x + 1872 = -1399*x for x.","response":"To solve the equation -1282*x + 1872 = -1399*x for x, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the x terms on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 1282*x to both sides, which will eliminate it from the left side: -1282*x + 1282*x + 1872 = -1399*x + 1282*x This simplifies to: 1872 = -117*x Step 2: Solve for x. Now that we have an equation with x on one side, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by -117: 1872 / -117 = -117*x / -117 This simplifies to: -16 = x So the solution to the equation -1282*x + 1872 = -1399*x is x = -16."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Which person had a husband and a fiance? , can you please find it? A Bill of Divorcement describes a day in the lives of a middle-aged Englishwoman named Margaret \\"Meg\\" Fairfield; her daughter Sydney; Sydney's fiancé Kit Humphreys; Meg's fiancé Gray Meredith; and Meg's husband Hilary, who escapes after spending almost twenty years in a mental hospital. After the family discusses Hilary's genetic predisposition toward psychiatric problems, which Sydney seems to have inherited, Hilary and Sydney give up Meg and Kit in order to avoid passing this trait to future generations. The film begins on Christmas Eve as Meg gives a party in her comfortable English manor. In addition to dancing and listening to Christmas carols, Sydney and Kit happily discuss their future together, as do Meg and Gray. The only unpleasant moment of the evening occurs when the singers dedicate their performance of God Bless the Master of This House to Gray. Hilary's sister Hester objects to this because she considers Hilary to be the master of the house even though he is psychotic and institutionalized. On Christmas morning, while Meg and Gray are at church, the asylum telephones to say that Hilary has gone missing, and Hester unintentionally reveals to Sydney that insanity runs in their family. The family's official explanation of Hilary's troubles has been that he experienced shell shock while fighting in World War I, but another family member had similar problems in the past. Hester and Sydney discuss Hilary's talent as a composer, and Sydney sits down at the piano to play an unfinished sonata that Hilary wrote before going to war. A few minutes later, Hilary returns home, having escaped from the asylum. He meets Sydney and they chat comfortably, except for a heated argument that serves to further display their similarities as sensitive, free-spirited individuals.

Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords.

Based on the information provided, the working-age population is 12,702,700. Next, we will determine the total population by summing the populations of the three age groups: ages 14 or under (5,131,666), ages 60 or over (2,525,573), and working age (12,702,700). Total population = 5,131,666 + 2,525,573 + 12,702,700 = 20,359,939 Now, we will calculate the percentage of the population that is not of dependency age (i.e., the working-age population) by dividing the working-age population by the total population and multiplying the result by 100. Percentage of non-dependency age population = (Working-age population / Total population) * 100 Percentage = (12,702,700 / 20,359,939) * 100 ≈ 62.4% Therefore, approximately 62.4% of the population was not of dependency age."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you have to generate the named entities (NER) given its ingredients of the recipe.

The son of Stephen VIII Báthory and a member of the Hungarian Báthory noble family, Báthory was a ruler of Transylvania in the 1570s, defeating another challenger for that title, Gáspár Bekes. In 1576 Báthory became the third elected king of Poland. He worked closely with chancellor Jan Zamoyski. The first years of his reign were focused on establishing power, defeating a fellow claimant to the throne, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and quelling rebellions, most notably, the Danzig rebellion. He reigned only a decade, but is considered one of the most successful kings in Polish history, particularly in the realm of military history. His signal achievement was his victorious campaign in Livonia against Russia in the middle part of his reign, in which he repulsed a Russian invasion of Commonwealth borderlands and secured a highly favorable treaty of peace . Question: How many years old was Báthory when he became the third elected king of Poland? Answer:","response":"To find out how old Báthory was when he became the third elected king of Poland, we need to calculate the difference between the year he became king and the year he was born. Stephen Báthory was born on September 27, 1533, and became King of Poland in 1576. To calculate his age at the time he became king, we can follow these steps: 1. Subtract his birth year from the year he became king: 1576 - 1533 = 43 years 2. Since his birthday is on September 27, and we don't have the exact date he became king in 1576, let's assume he became king before September 27. Hence, he would have already turned 43 years old in that year. Therefore, Báthory was 43 years old when he became the third elected king of Poland."},{"question":"During the last four months, the people of Ukraine have been fighting for their freedom, independence and European path in a war started by Russia-backed terrorists and their accomplices. Ukrainian military forces suffer heavy losses in battles against terrorists equipped with the newest Russian weaponry. We've seen reports of the pro-Russian thugs shooting women and children, cynically calling it a \\"protection of the Russian-speaking population.\\" The price we are paying to bring peace back to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine is too high. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has proposed the decentralization of power as part of his peace plan. It means more freedom, more economic autonomy and more opportunities to use languages spoken in a particular community for every region. How rebels in Ukraine built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies. Ukraine has also demonstrated its genuine willingness to resolve this crisis through negotiations and compromises. Our armed forces have shown exceptional restraint during their military operations in order to avoid casualties among peaceful civilians and prevent destruction of their towns and villages. Our unilateral cease-fire in the zone of the conflict had lasted from June 20 to June 30, during which 27 Ukrainian servicemen, from all over Ukraine, were killed by the bandits. On July 17 we believe the terrorists fired at the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, cutting short the lives of almost 300 people. This was a tragic wake-up call to the whole world. From now on Russian exporters of terrorism bring tragedy and tears to people across the planet -- from the Netherlands to Australia. Ukrainians, knowing too well the bitterness of loss, sincerely share grief with the families of the deceased. Our government is conducting, together with a team of international experts, a thorough investigation of the circumstances of this heinous act of terrorism. There is already incontrovertible evidence that the airliner was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile system that had arrived from Russia. When civilian planes are shot down. For the first time since 1983, when a Soviet jet fighter deliberately shot down a South Korean Boeing 747, Russia stands entangled in such a horrendous tragedy. We remember that an objective investigation of that catastrophe was made possible only 10 years later, after the USSR collapsed. We would not like to have to wait that long to learn the truth about the tragedy of MH17. Indeed, the guilty must be promptly punished. We are encouraged with the growing understanding in both the West and the East of the nature of terrorism in eastern Ukraine. While U.S. senators and European Union ministers already consider designating the Donetsk People's Republic and its Luhansk twin as terrorist organizations, we expect Russia to halt its support to terrorists. Since most of them are Russian citizens and \\"former\\" security service officers, we also urge Moscow to take them away from Ukraine. They must go home. Russian sponsorship of terrorism in Ukraine amply demonstrates that in the 21st century any regional conflict invariably poses a threat to global security. International and internal terrorism, as well as unbridled export of conventional and high-tech weaponry, have no regard for state borders, national sovereignty or human lives. Ukraine has been consistently advocating not only international control of nuclear weapons, but today we also stand for the creation of a universal mechanism for international control of conventional arms.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","response":"Rdiff-backup maintains an entire (uncompressed) copy of the files you are backing up, and it also keeps a history (incremental backups). This means that your backup space needs to be larger than the data you're securing. For instance, if you are backing up 100 gigabytes of space, you may need 120 gigabytes of available storage space (preferably on a separate hard drive). The rdiff-backup tool uses a combination of reverse incremental backup and data compression to minimize storage requirements while maintaining an up-to-date mirror of your data. It keeps the most recent backup in an uncompressed form, allowing for immediate access and restoration if needed. At the same time, it stores incremental changes from previous backup iterations in a compressed format to save space. To ensure the integrity of your backups, rdiff-backup verifies the data before and after the backup process. This further guarantees the safety of your files and ensures that they are identical to the source data. Using a separate hard drive or storage device for your rdiff-backup is highly recommended. Doing so provides extra protection against data loss or corruption that may result from hardware failure or software issues with your primary storage device. When planning for your backup storage requirements, it is crucial to consider the future growth of your data. Data may increase over time due to new files or modifications to existing files. To be prepared for this growth and continued backup efficiency, it's essential to have sufficient storage capacity and periodically review your backup storage needs. To summarize, rdiff-backup is a powerful and efficient tool for maintaining an uncompressed copy of your data, along with an incremental backup history. It's crucial to ensure that the storage space allocated for backup is larger than the source data you want to protect and placed on a separate hard drive or storage device to minimize the risks of data loss. Regularly reviewing your storage needs and adjusting capacity accordingly will help maintain the effectiveness of your backup process."},{"question":"Q:What does the term prima donna mean?

If the answer can be found in the passage, label it as \\"span\\". If the answer is a number, label as \\"number\\". Similarly, label \\"date\\" if you think the answer to the given question is a date. Input: Passage: Coming off their dominating win over the Saints, the Broncos traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel with the Cincinnati Bengals. A 43-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos an early lead, but the Bengals countered in the second quarter, with a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. The Broncos responded, with a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos added to their lead, when return specialist Trindon Holliday took the opening kickoff of the second half 105 yards for a touchdown. However, the Bengals would reel off 17 unanswered points, consisting of a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andy Dalton to wide receiver A. J. Green, a 49-field goal by Nugent followed in the fourth quarter by running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushing for a 2-yard touchdown, with the latter two scores coming off Manning interceptions. This gave Cincinnati a 20-17 lead early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos re-claimed the lead on their next possession, with Manning connecting on a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. Ten plays into the Bengals' next possession, Dalton was intercepted by cornerback Champ Bailey at the Bengals' 46-yard line, and the Broncos subsequently added to their lead eight plays later, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Decker. Trailing 31-20 with 3:36 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally, with Nugent nailing a 41-yard field goal with 52 seconds remaining, but the Broncos recovered the onside kick in the game's final minute and subsequently ran out the clock. Peyton Manning improved his personal record to 8-0 all-time in games against the Bengals. Question: How many yards was the longest field goal of the game?

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Florence's older sister Frances Parthenope had similarly been named after her place of birth, Parthenope, a Greek settlement now part of the city of Naples. The family moved back to England in 1821, with Nightingale being brought up in the family's homes at Embley, Hampshire and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire. Florence inherited a liberal-humanitarian outlook from both sides of her family. Florence Nightingale exhibited a gift for mathematics from an early age and excelled in the subject under the tutelage of her father. Later, Nightingale became a pioneer in the visual presentation of information and statistical graphics. She used methods such as the pie chart, which had first been developed by William Playfair in 1801. While taken for granted now, it was at the time a relatively novel method of presenting data. Indeed, Nightingale is described as \\"a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics\\", and is credited with developing a form of the pie chart now known as the polar area diagram, or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. Nightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a \\"coxcomb\\", but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society. In 1874 she became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association. Her attention turned to the health of the British army in India and she demonstrated that bad drainage, contaminated water, overcrowding and poor ventilation were causing the high death rate. She concluded that the health of the army and the people of India had to go hand in hand and so campaigned to improve the sanitary conditions of the country as a whole. Nightingale made a comprehensive statistical study of sanitation in Indian rural life and was the leading figure in the introduction of improved medical care and public health service in India. In 1858 and 1859, she successfully lobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation. Two years later, she provided a report to the commission, which completed its own study in 1863. \\"After 10 years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per 1,000\\". The Royal Sanitary Commission of 1868-9 presented Nightingale with an opportunity to press for compulsory sanitation in private houses. She lobbied the minister responsible, James Stansfeld, to strengthen the proposed Public Health Bill to require owners of existing properties to pay for connection to mains drainage. The strengthened legislation was enacted in the Public Health Acts of 1874 and 1875. At the same time she combined with the retired sanitary reformer Edwin Chadwick to persuade Stansfeld to devolve powers to enforce the law to Local Authorities, eliminating central control by medical technocrats. Her Crimean War statistics had convinced her that non-medical approaches were more effective given the state of knowledge at the time. Historians now believe that both drainage and devolved enforcement played a crucial role in increasing average national life expectancy by 20 years between 1871 and the mid-1930s during which time medical science made no impact on the most fatal epidemic diseases. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What type of graphics did she like?","response":"Florence Nightingale liked and pioneered the use of visual presentation of information and statistical graphics.

A. Driveway - Unlikely, as driveways are usually made of concrete or asphalt and don't typically have stones suitable for skipping. B. Gallbladder - This is not a relevant option since it's an internal body organ and has nothing to do with finding stones. C. River bed - This is a possibility since rivers usually have a variety of stones, some of which could be suitable for skipping. D. Quarry - While a quarry is a source of stones, they are typically much larger and not appropriate for skipping. E. Creek bed - Similar to the river bed option, creek beds are also a natural source of smaller stones that might be suitable for skipping. Based on these considerations, the best answer would be C. River bed or E.

Starr's early life was marked by hardships; shortly after the start of World War II, his father's reserve unit was activated and in 1942 he was deployed to the Pacific Theater. He was first in the U.S. Army but transferred to the U.S. Air Force for his military career. Context: Immediately after his retirement as a player, Starr served as the Packers' quarterbacks coach and called plays in 1972 under head coach Dan Devine, when the Packers won the NFC Central division title at 10-4 with Scott Hunter under center. He pursued business interests and was then a broadcaster for CBS for two seasons. When Devine left for Notre Dame after the 1974 season, Starr was hired as head coach of the Packers on Christmas Eve. Upon taking the job, he recognized the long odds of a Hall of Fame player becoming a successful head coach. Initially given a three-year contract, he led the Packers for nine years, the first five as his own general manager. His regular season record was a disappointing 52-76-2 (.408), with a playoff record of 1-1. Posting a 5-3-1 record in the strike-shortened season of 1982, Starr's Packers made their first playoff appearance in ten years (and their last for another 11 years). They defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 41-16 in the expanded wild card round of 16 teams on January 8, 1983, then lost to the Dallas Cowboys 37-26 in the divisional round the following week. He tallied only three other non-losing seasons as Packers coach. After a disappointing 8-8 finish the following year, Starr was dismissed in favor of his former teammate Forrest Gregg, who previously led the Cincinnati Bengals to Super Bowl XVI in the 1981 season and coached the Cleveland Browns before. On January 13, 1984, Starr was named the head coach of the Arizona Firebirds, a proposed expansion team for the NFL. The NFL never granted the would-be ownership group of the Firebirds a team. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article that provide insight into the life and career of Bart Starr, a well-known figure in the sports world. Here are a few key takeaways: 1. Military family background: Bart Starr's father served in both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force, which reflects the family's dedication to serving their country. This likely influenced Starr's upbringing and work ethic throughout his life. 2. Early hardships: Starr's early life was marked by challenges due to his father's deployment during World War II, which significantly impacted the family. These experiences likely shaped Starr's resilience and determination to achieve success in his career. 3. Transition from player to coach: After retiring from his career as a player, Starr quickly shifted roles by pursuing various interests, including serving as a coach, a businessman, and even exploring a career in broadcasting. 4. Coaching success and struggles: Despite his success as a player, Starr had a difficult time transitioning to the role of head coach. His regular-season record with the Packers was subpar, and he only managed to clinch a playoff appearance once (1982 season). This emphasizes the challenges that come with adapting to a new role even for a highly successful and skilled individual. 5. Connection with Arizona Firebirds: An intriguing aspect of the article is Starr's association with the Arizona Firebirds, a proposed expansion team for the NFL. Although the team was never granted official membership, it's interesting to consider what might have been if Starr had successfully led another professional football team. In conclusion, this article provides a comprehensive overview of Bart Starr's life and career, shedding light on his transition from a successful professional football player to a coach and the challenges he faced along the way. His connection to the military and the multiple roles he embraced in his professional life underscore a multifaceted and resilient individual, making his story a compelling one for sports enthusiasts and beyond."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

How to fix a lighter Ensure that it isn't shattered. If you broke the plastic part of your lighter then you'll need a new one. The pressure is compromised and you won't be able to use it anymore.","response":"However, if the lighter appears to be intact but simply not functioning, there are several possible causes and solutions to address. First, check the fuel level, as an empty lighter will not ignite. You can refill a butane lighter by connecting a butane canister to the lighter's refill valve, usually found at its base, and depress the canister nozzle to release the gas into the lighter. Make sure to do this in a well-ventilated area away from open flames or sparks. If your lighter uses lighter fluid, simply open the lighter's reservoir and carefully pour the fluid inside without overfilling or spilling. Close the lighter and let it sit for a few minutes to allow the fluid to be absorbed by the lighter's wick. If you've re-fueled your lighter and it's still not igniting, there might be potential issues with its flint or spark wheel, which are responsible for creating the spark needed to ignite the fuel. To replace the flint, open the flint holder, typically located beneath the flint wheel. Remove the old flint and insert a new one, followed by the spring, and secure the holder back in place. If the spark wheel appears to be worn or damaged, you may need to buy a replacement part or consult with the manufacturer. Sometimes, a lighter may not work properly due to accumulated debris or dirt, preventing a proper flow of fuel and air. To address this, clean the lighter's fuel jet and vent holes using a toothpick, needle, or compressed air. Be gentle so you do not damage any delicate internal components. Ultimately, if none of these solutions seem to work, it's important to recognize when the lighter may have reached the end of its lifespan and consider purchasing a new one. Lighter life expectancies can vary depending on factors like quality, frequency of use, and proper maintenance. But no matter how durable they appear, every lighter has a limited life. Choosing to invest in a new lighter not only ensures a reliable flame, but also reduces the risk of accidents due to malfunctioning or leaking units."},{"question":"The three drive-ins nearest to Madison, all less than an hour's drive, are: Big Sky Twin Drive-In Theatres in Wisconsin Dells, Highway 18 Outdoor Theatre, near Jefferson, and Sky-Vu Drive-In, near Monroe.

Question 2: What is the difference between a pocket veto and the actual veto power of the President of India? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Hello little friend! I'll gladly explain the answers to your questions. Question 1: In India, there are two types of bodies called constitutional and statutory bodies. Constitutional bodies are mentioned in the Indian Constitution, like a treasure map with special locations. The Constitution is a big book of rules for the country. The bodies mentioned in it have been created following these rules. Examples are the Election Commission and the Public Service Commission. Statutory bodies, on the other hand, are not mentioned in the Constitution. They are created by laws passed by the Parliament, which is like a big team that makes decisions for the country. Examples of statutory bodies are the Reserve Bank of India and the National Human Rights Commission. Question 2: In India, the President has different types of veto powers, like special buttons they can push when they don't agree with a law. There are two important buttons called \\"pocket veto\\" and \\"actual veto.\\" A pocket veto is like a secret power. The President keeps the bill, or the paper with the law written on it, in their pocket and does not take any action. There is no time limit, so it can take as long as the President wants. The bill might not become a law or might just wait longer. The actual veto power is more open. The President says \\"no\\" to the bill, and it goes back to the Parliament. The big team can discuss it again and, if they still want that law, they can pass the bill with more votes. The President then has to accept it, and the bill becomes a law. Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They talk about different topics: one is about different types of bodies in India, and the other is about the President's powers. But both questions help us understand more about India's government."},{"question":"Eight-year-old Jesse Abrogate was playing in the sea late one evening in July 2001 when a 7-foot bull shark attacked him and tore off his arm.

Pretty soon, a helicopter arrived and flew the boy to hospital. It was a much quicker journey than the journey by road. Jesse's uncle, Vance Folsenzier, ran back into the sea and found the shark that had attacked his nephew. He picked the shark up and threw it onto the beach. A coastguard shot the fish four times and although this didn't kill it, the shark's jaws relaxed so that they could open them, and reach down onto its stomach, and pull out the boy's arm.

And the answer is...","response":"To solve the equation -77*a + 107*a - 330 = 0 for the variable 'a', we first need to simplify the left-hand side of the equation: 1. Combine the terms with 'a': (-77*a) + (107*a) = -77a + 107a = (107 - 77)a = 30*a. So now our equation looks like: 30*a - 330 = 0. 2. To isolate 'a', we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation: 30*a = 330. 3. Finally, divide both sides by 30, the coefficient of 'a': a = 330 / 30. a = 11. So the solution of the equation -77*a + 107*a - 330 = 0 is a = 11."},{"question":"After the Peace of Westphalia, several border territories were assigned to the United Provinces.

To provide a more detailed and long answer, here is the translation of the sentence along with some context and explanation: The sentence refers to an action or change that the neighbors must undertake in a specific direction, possibly to adapt to a new situation, achieve a goal, or improve in some way. Here is the sentence broken down into its components: 1. \\"Its neighbours\\" - \\"Ses voisins\\": This part of the sentence uses the possessive pronoun \\"its\\" to indicate that the neighbors belong or are related to something, likely a country or region previously mentioned. \\"Voisins\\" means neighbors and \\"Ses\\" means its in French. 2. \\"also\\" - \\"également\\": This adverb indicates that the action or change is not only required for whatever the sentence was initially discussing but is also essential for the neighbors. It adds a sense of inclusivity to the statement, making it clear that the entire group or region should take the same course of action. 3. \\"need to make their move\\" - \\"doivent faire leur mouvement\\": This part of the sentence emphasizes the necessity for these neighbors to engage in a particular action or path. \\"Doivent\\" indicates a strong obligation, similar to the English \\"must\\" or \\"need to.\\" The phrase \\"faire leur mouvement\\" can be understood as taking a step or making a decisive action in a specific direction, often to illustrate progress or transformation. 4. \\"in this direction\\" - \\"dans cette direction\\": This phrase reveals that the action or change to be undertaken by the neighbors should be following a particular path or direction. This direction could involve socio-economic growth, infrastructural improvements, diplomatic actions, or any other topic where progress is expected.

However, it does not specifically answer the question, \\"Newborns are particularly susceptible to infections caused by?\\" in a comprehensive manner. To provide a more complete answer, let's first break down the original sentence and then discuss what types of infections newborns are especially vulnerable to. When the sentence states that neonates (newborns) are in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, it means that the immune systems of newborns are not as well-developed or efficient as those in older children or adults. The immune system is the body’s defense mechanism against invading pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. It is composed of two primary components: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity, also known as non-specific immunity, is the body's first line of defense against the infection. It includes physical barriers like the skin and mucous membranes, as well as immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages that are capable of destroying foreign organisms. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, is a more specialized and specific response that involves the production of antibodies and the activation of immune cells called T cells and B cells. Adaptive immunity provides a targeted and long-lasting defense against specific pathogens. Since both the innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed in newborns, they are more vulnerable to infections. Now, to answer the question directly, newborns are particularly susceptible to infections caused by a variety of pathogens, including: 1. Bacteria: Group B Streptococcus (GBS), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes are some of the most common bacterial infections in neonates. GBS, in particular, can be acquired from the mother during childbirth and can lead to life-threatening complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, and even death. 2. Viruses: Newborns are also susceptible to viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rotavirus, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). RSV often causes respiratory infections, while rotavirus is a leading cause of severe diarrhea in infants. HSV transmission can occur during birth, resulting in skin, eye, and mouth infections or more severe complications like encephalitis. 3. Fungi: Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans, can cause an opportunistic infection called candidiasis in newborns. The infection may present as oral thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth) or diaper rash, and in severe cases, it may disseminate to other organs and tissues, leading to a systemic candidiasis. 4. Parasites: Although less common, newborns can experience parasitic infections such as toxoplasmosis and malaria. Toxoplasmosis, caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is usually acquired by the fetus in utero if the mother becomes infected during pregnancy. Malaria transmission to the newborn can occur in areas where the disease is endemic. In conclusion, the given sentence gives us an understanding of the reason behind the increased susceptibility of newborns to infections but does not explicitly list the infections caused by various pathogens. Newborns are particularly susceptible to infections caused by a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, due to the underdeveloped state of their innate and adaptive immune responses."},{"question":"next question: What problems do children have learning about the world? Options: - confusion - anger - sadness - loss of innocence - frustration reasoning:","response":"Children may face various challenges while learning about the world. Here are some problems they could encounter and the reasoning behind them: 1. Confusion: As children are exposed to new concepts and ideas, they may find it difficult to comprehend and make sense of everything. This confusion can arise from the complexity of the subject, differences in opinions or cultural backgrounds, or simply a lack of prior knowledge. 2. Anger: When children are exposed to unpleasant or unfair situations or events, they may feel angry. This can result from a perceived lack of control, injustice, or the inability to change the outcome of a situation. 3. Sadness: Learning about the world can expose children to realities such as pain, suffering, or the loss of a loved one, leading to feelings of sadness. Furthermore, they may struggle to process their emotions or feel burdened by the weight of issues they discover. 4. Loss of innocence: As children learn about the world outside their immediate surroundings, they can become disillusioned with what they previously believed in or deemed acceptable. This loss of innocence may stem from exposure to harsh realities, moral dilemmas, or conflicting beliefs. 5. Frustration: Children may become frustrated when they struggle to understand or master new skills or knowledge. This can be due to cognitive or developmental limitations, sensory processing challenges, or a lack of appropriate resources or support."},{"question":"Q:The person is laying on the beach, why would he do that?

A:","response":"The most suitable option to answer the question of why a person is laying on the beach is A. sun himself. This option is the most fitting because spending time at the beach provides an ideal opportunity for individuals to bask in the sunlight, which can have numerous physical and psychological benefits. For many people, soaking up the sun's rays is a highly enjoyable pastime. Sunbathing can help the body synthesize vitamin D, an essential nutrient that contributes to the regulation of calcium and phosphate levels in the body, as well as support normal immune system function. By aiding bone and muscle health, vitamin D helps to prevent various diseases such as rickets and osteoporosis. Additionally, sunbathing is believed to enhance the production of endorphins, also known as \\"feel-good\\" hormones, which contribute to feelings of happiness and well-being. Besides the undeniable health benefits, sunbathing on the beach allows for relaxation and escape from daily stressors. The soothing sound of waves, the sensation of soft sand beneath the skin, and the expansive vista of the horizon can all foster a calm and peaceful state of mind. Laying on the beach provides a rare opportunity to be present and enjoy a slower pace of life, temporarily free from distractions and obligations. Furthermore, spending time on the beach offers a chance to engage in other enjoyable activities such as swimming, reading, or socializing with friends and family. Laying under the sun can often lead to feeling more connected with nature and the environment, which may inspire a deeper appreciation for life and its simple pleasures. In summary, the most suitable option for why a person would be laying on the beach is to sun themselves, as this action provides numerous physical and mental benefits in addition to offering a moment of calm, pleasure, and connection with nature."},{"question":"Answer this question: who won the european cup the most times??","response":"The team that won the European Cup (also known as the UEFA Champions League) the most times is Real Madrid, a football team from Spain.

David Hume was a Scottish philosopher and historian who became a central figure in the 18th-century philosophical movement known as the Scottish Enlightenment. He is best known for developing a philosophical position known as Humean empiricism, which argues that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. He was also a significant figure in the Western tradition of skepticism, where he cast doubt on concepts often taken for granted such as causation, self-identity, and the existence of an external world. Hume's philosophical approach can be described as empirical and skeptical. Empiricism is a school of philosophy that insists that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience. It rejects the idea of innate ideas or knowledge derived from reason alone. For Hume, our knowledge is limited to the scope of our sense experience and memory. He insisted on the idea that causal relationships between events, for instance, could not be known absolutely but only as a habit or custom of thought. Hume's skepticism, on the other hand, questioned the reliability of these perceptions, going as far as to question the very notion of self or identity over time. He cast doubt on a wide array of philosophical concepts and challenged the very foundations upon which philosophy often is built. His concept of skepticism has been influential in various branches of philosophy, particularly in epistemology. Additionally, Hume was a highly influential figure in the field of ethics, where he promoted the theory of ethical sentimentalism. He posited that moral judgments are rooted in our sentiments or feelings, in contrast to the rationalist approaches prevalent during his time. He conceived of morality as more rooted in our human nature and emotions rather than as a result of rational deliberation. In the realm of political philosophy, Hume was instrumental in promoting a form of classical liberalism and famously critiqued the social contract theory of political legitimacy. Hume's philosophical writings profoundly influenced subsequent generations of philosophers, and his ideas continue to be studied, debated, and developed. Whether in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, or political philosophy, Hume's empiricism and skepticism represent crucial developments in the history of philosophy. Thus, he is rightfully considered a major figure in these areas of philosophy."},{"question":"Cancer Bats are a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario. They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band. The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows.

Whenever the down[load] speed is below 50Mbps the Pi uses a Twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50Mbps down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied.\\" AlekseyP made the Twitter bot's code available on Pastebin. \\"I am by no means some fancy programmer so there is no need to point out that my code is ugly or could be better,\\" the Redditor wrote. AlekseyP set the tweeting threshold at 50Mbps in part because the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet port tops out at 100Mbps. The Twitter account controlled by the bot has tweeted speed test results 16 times in the past three months, often getting replies from Comcast customer service. Speeds were at their worst on New Year's Day when they dropped to 2Mbps: \\"Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep,\\" AlekseyP wrote. Of course, no consumer broadband service hits advertised speeds 100 percent of the time for all customers. Speeds are generally advertised as \\"up to\\" a certain Mbps. Comcast says on its website that \\"Actual speeds vary and are not guaranteed.\\" If AlekseyP's Raspberry Pi has been running hourly speed tests and only found lower-than 50Mbps speeds 16 times in three months, that would mean actual speeds are 50Mbps or above more than 99 percent of the time. AlekseyP has rebuffed efforts by Comcast customer service to gather more information. \\"Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address... usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values,\\" AlekseyP wrote. \\"I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.\\" One Redditor who works as a field technician for Comcast posted a detailed reply to the thread, saying that a few things could cause speed drops, including radio frequency interference, a damaged cable, or a bad modem. Another Comcast employee, VP of Internet Services Jason Livingood, detailed some potential flaws in AlekseyP's testing methodology. AlekseyP did write in a comment that performance has gotten better recently. \\"I set this up because I was frustrated during a period of constant drops and outages. It is a lot better now. We used not be able to stream Netflix and I would fail to connect to CSGO [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive] matches,\\" AlekseyP wrote. Comcast better than most ISPs in FCC test The Federal Communications Commission evaluates whether Comcast and other large ISPs consistently deliver advertised speeds in its annual Measuring Broadband America study. The latest report, based on tests in September 2014, shows that Comcast's slower speed tiers (from 3Mbps to 50Mbps downloads) were on average delivering download speeds higher than advertised during peak usage hours. At Comcast's 105Mbps tier, the cable company was delivering 94.6 percent of advertised speed during peak hours. Average speed across all customers isn't the only important measure, because some subscribers could be getting much slower speeds without bringing the average down much. More than 90 percent of Comcast customers got at least 95 percent of advertised download speeds in the FCC measurements. A few percent got between 80 and 95 percent of advertised speeds, while about 5 percent were getting less than 80 percent of advertised speeds. In this measure, Comcast outperformed most ISPs: Despite that, there are a decent number of Comcast customers who pay for higher speeds but aren't consistently getting them, as the report showed that Comcast often struggled to match advertised speeds for 105Mbps customers: ||||| Yelling at a big company like Comcast when things aren’t working right isn’t going to do you much good, so what’s the next best thing? Being really passive aggressive, of course. Reddit user AlekseyP has managed to automate passive aggression with a Raspberry Pi. Every time his Comcast internet speeds drop significantly below what he’s paying for, The Raspberry Pi will publicly tweet at Comcast. You can check out the account for AlekseyP’s custom Comcast-annoyance machine. The device is connected to AlekseyP’s local network and runs a series of speed tests once per hour. The service tier is supposed to provide 150MB down and 10MB up, speeds that AlekseyP says he often does not get. When speeds drop below 50MB down (the Raspberry Pi’s ethernet tops out at 100MB anyway), the bot sends a tweet to @Comcast, @ComcastCares, and @Xfinifty with the live numbers. It also logs the values to a local database so it can be monitored. Judging by the Twitter account, AlekseyP has speed issues fairly often, sometimes more than once per day. He stresses that he’s not doing this to get support from Comcast — it’s more of a “name and shame” situation. Comcast always tweets back asking for his account details, but speeds have usually returned to normal by then. He’s also wary about revealing himself to Comcast and being branded a troublemaker. AlekseyP also posted the Python code he wrote to make the Raspberry Pi annoy Comcast automatically. It should be trivially easy to make a few tweaks and get it running on your own Raspberry Pi.

Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","response":"No, the answer you found on Google does not provide a correct and clear explanation of the Universal Law of Gravitation. The Universal Law of Gravitation, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, states that any two objects with mass attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where: F is the gravitational force between the two objects, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the objects. The answer you found may be referring to the fact that the gravitational constant G was not measured experimentally until 71 years after Newton's death, which indeed made it impossible for Newton to determine the exact value of the gravitational forces involved. However, Newton's calculations still provided valuable insights into the nature of gravitational force and established the foundation for our understanding of gravity."},{"question":"Translate \\"About 700,000 people in Serbia are living below the poverty line, with a monthly income of less than 80 euros, according to a new database on the socially vulnerable.\\" to Turkish?","response":"\\"Yeni bir sosyal açıdan savunmasızlar veri tabanına göre, Sırbistan'da yaklaşık 700.000 kişi yoksulluk sınırının altında, aylık geliri 80 eurodan daha az olan bir yaşam sürdürmektedir.\\" In this translation, the original English sentence was translated into Turkish, maintaining the meaning and context.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Input: Article: Now that America has declared a state of swine flu public health emergency, you may be asking yourself -- what am Isupposed to do? Here is a list of practical steps you can take to prepare and protect yourself and your family. 1) Know the symptoms-- Here are some of the symptoms that sound like swine flu -- fevers over 100 degrees (37.8degC), body aches, cough, runny nose, and sometimes, nausea and diarrhea . It's also useful to know if you might have had an exposure either by recent travel to Mexico, or to the areas of known cases so far in America -- specific areas of California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Kansas. Or you may have been exposed to a sick person who came from those areas. 2) Don't panic-- If you have symptoms that sound like swine flu, do not rush to hospitals. Not only is this difficult for the healthcare system, it can also be potentially dangerous for everyone. Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in. 3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others. 4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal about the mouth and nose. 5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products. So if you want to eat pork, you can. 6) Getting sick? Stay home!-- In our go-go-go culture and these severe economic times, it can be very hard to call a boss and cancel a day's work. Now, however, if you or your loved ones are feeling like there's a flu coming on, stay home. 7) Stockpile?-- Right now, it's too early for any of us to become a Swine Flu Shut-In, but the public health department recommends that each home have two weeks of supplies, in case we must stay home -- either for illness or to help contain transmission. That means two weeks of food for everyone in your home, two weeks of all medications, and, if you're like most people, two weeks of books and DVDs. Question: The purpose of the writer is mainly to _ . Options: (A) analyze the possible causes of swine flu (B) tell people how to protect themselves from swine flu (C) give people some information about the present situation of swine flu (D) suggest some treatments for swine flu Asnwer: B Output:","response":"Yes"},{"question":"Context: Jesse looked the part in the play they were putting on.

President Francois Hollande's Socialists have lost ground overall and may lose control of some major towns. The vote is seen as a key test for the Socialists, deeply unpopular after nearly two years in power. The Socialists were also hit by the low turnout in the first round of the elections - exit polls suggest up to 35% of voters stayed at home. The vote is to choose councillors and mayors in more than 36,000 villages, towns and cities. The anti-immigration National Front (FN) took 50.26% of the vote in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont, which has historically voted for the left. Elsewhere, in Avignon and Perpignan in the south, the party's candidates for mayor had the biggest number of votes. In some 200 places FN candidates have won through to the second round next weekend. Marine Le Pen, National Front leader since 2011, hailed the results, saying her party had \\"arrived as a major independent force - a political force at both national and local level\\". The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that in most cases, these candidates have little chance of gaining control of the town halls as they will be beaten in round two. However, it is a big advance for the far right and an expression of the growing popular exasperation with the establishment parties of the right and the left, he says. Many people who voted for President Hollande two years ago chose to abstain, which has meant losses for the Socialists, our correspondent notes, and in many important towns they will struggle in the second round to hold off challenges from the main centre-right UMP opposition party. Earlier, pollsters identified half a dozen towns that could see National Front rule as a result of the elections, giving it the chance to show it can be trusted with power after attempts to run four towns in the late 1990s revealed its lack of competence, Reuters news agency said.","response":"The National Front (FN), an anti-immigration party, has won 50.26% of the vote in the French town of Henin-Beaumont in the first round of local elections, and has led in other towns including Avignon and Perpignan in the south.

Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact? \\"Yul Brynner names the Jewish Holy Day that Christians celebrate as Easter.\\"","response":"Step 1: Understand the question The question asks whether the given statement - \\"Yul Brynner names the Jewish Holy Day that Christians celebrate as Easter\\" - is a verifiable fact. In other words, we need to determine if this statement can be proven true or false. Step 2: Break down the statement There are two parts to the statement: 1. Yul Brynner, an actor, talks about a Jewish Holy Day. 2. The Jewish Holy Day mentioned by Yul Brynner is the one Christians celebrate as Easter. Step 3: Verify the information To determine if this statement is a verifiable fact, we need to find evidence that supports both parts of the statement. Part 1: It can be challenging to find specific instances where Yul Brynner may have talked about a Jewish Holy Day, as there might not be any recordings or documented conversations available. So, verifying this part might be difficult. Part 2: Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It has some connections with the Jewish holiday of Passover, as Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection occurred around the time of Passover. However, Easter and Passover are not the same holiday, even though they may share some similarities and coincide in certain years. So, this part of the statement can be considered inaccurate. Step 4: Conclusion After analyzing the statement, we can conclude that it is not a verifiable fact, as we cannot find substantial evidence that Yul Brynner specifically named the Jewish Holy Day that Christians celebrate as Easter.

For the previous two years, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of the life of Labor's second term, a diary that forms the center of the narrative . The Point of Departureis Robin Cook's plain account of this extraordinary period in our political history, the most important political publication of the decade. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to bring about some changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed was essential if Parliament was to move into the 21stcentury. As Tony Blair told him, \\"This is the job for you.\\" Drawing on first-hand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences, and late night conversations, we follow his gathering disillusionment as the political compass of the government changes to directions which he believes to be completely mistaken: from its failure about Lords reform and its unwillingness to provide leadership for social change, to a foreign policy which has led us away from our responsibility in Europe, into closer relationship with the most right-wing government in American history, and participation in Bush's war on Iraq. This is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is a story of a politician who truly wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly separated from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing belief that on Iraq, its position was morally, diplomatically and politically wrong. Robin Cook first entered Parliament as MP for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He held a number of senior positions in Opposition -- Shadow Foreign Secretary, Shadow Health and Social Services Secretary -- before becoming Foreign Secretary in 1997. In 2001 he was appointed Leader of the House of Commons, a position from which he resigned in March 2003 in protest against the coming war in Iraq. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who quit? 2. What did he quit? 3. where? 4. What country was he from? 5.

He was the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States, running alongside former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Ryan also has been the U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district since 1999. He was previously chair of the House Ways and Means Committee from January 3 to October 29, 2015, and, before that, chair of the House Budget Committee from 2011 to 2015. Context: Ryan was first elected to the House in 1998, winning the 1st District seat of Republican Mark Neumann, a two-term incumbent who had vacated his seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. Ryan won the Republican primary over 29-year-old pianist Michael J. Logan of Twin Lakes, and the general election against Democrat Lydia Spottswood. This made him the second-youngest member of the House. Reelected eight times, Ryan has never received less than 55 percent of the vote. He defeated Democratic challenger Jeffrey C. Thomas in the 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006 elections. In the 2008 election, Ryan defeated Democrat Marge Krupp. In the 2010 general election, he defeated Democrat John Heckenlively and Libertarian Joseph Kexel. In 2012, under Wisconsin election law, Ryan was allowed to run concurrently for vice president and for Congress and was not allowed to remove his name from the Congressional ballot after being nominated for the vice presidency. He faced Democratic nominee Rob Zerban. As of July 25, 2012, Ryan had over 5.4 million in his congressional campaign account, more than any other House member. He was reelected with 55 percent of his district's vote and 44 percent of the vote in his hometown, Janesville. Zerban again challenged Ryan in the 2014 House election. Ryan won with 63 percent of his district's vote. In the 2016 Republican primary election, Ryan faced businessman Paul Nehlen, who had been endorsed by Sarah Palin. Because of Nehlen's support for Trump, Trump publicly thanked him on Twitter and later told The Washington Post that Nehlen was \\"running a very good campaign\\", even though he did not endorse him. On August 5, 2016, Trump endorsed Ryan's re-election after pressure from fellow Republican leaders. In the August 9, 2016 primary election, Ryan overwhelmingly defeated Nehlen, taking over 84 percent of the vote. In the November general election, Ryan faced Democrat Ryan Solen and won with 65 percent of his district's vote. Question: Was there any controversy in his elections? Answer:","response":"Yes, there was some controversy in Paul Ryan's elections. In the 2016 Republican primary election, Ryan faced businessman Paul Nehlen, who was endorsed by Sarah Palin. Paul Nehlen supported Donald Trump, and Trump even thanked him publicly and said he was \\"running a very good campaign.\\" This caused some tension because Trump did not initially endorse Ryan. However, later, under pressure from fellow Republican leaders, Trump did endorse Ryan's re-election. In the end, Ryan won the primary with over 84% of the vote and also won the November general election."},{"question":"Class A is twice as big as Class B. Class A is also a third the size of Class C.

On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones?, what is it ?

Translate to Russian","response":"To translate the text \\"A\\" to Russian might seem simple at first, but it's important to contextualize the request to ensure an accurate translation. The letter \\"A\\" itself can be translated into Russian as \\"А\\" (capital letter) or \\"а\\" (lowercase letter). However, if \\"A\\" refers to a specific text rather than just the letter, it's vital to have the entire content to provide a proper translation. When translating from English to Russian, the process involves several steps to ensure that you retain the meaning and context from the source language (English) to the target language (Russian). Here is a detailed breakdown of the translation process: 1. Understand the context: Thoroughly read and analyze the source text \\"A\\" to understand the intended meaning and message. Determine if it's a formal piece, poetry, dialogue, or technical writing. This comprehension will guide the translation process. 2. Vocabulary and terminology: Identifying the essential vocabulary and specific phrases in the source text is crucial. You must then find appropriate Russian equivalents, keeping in mind the context and tone of the document. 3. Grammar and syntax: Russian grammar and syntax differ fundamentally from English. The language has six cases, which determine the endings of words, while English grammar primarily relies on word order. It's essential to understand these differences to produce an accurate translation. 4. Idiomatic expressions: Some phrases don't have a direct translation, especially idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms. In such cases, the translator must find a Russian expression that conveys the same idea or rephrase the concept using existing Russian vocabulary. 5. Cultural adaptation: After translating the core text, consider any cultural nuances and adapt them to suit the Russian context. This step sometimes involves altering particular phrases or examples. 6. Proofreading and editing: Once you've completed the translation, proofread the text for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors. It's also a good idea to have another translator familiar with both languages review the text to ensure everything is accurate and coherent. 7. Formatting: Maintain the original formatting as much as possible or adapt it to the preferred Russian style. This might include headings, fonts, spacing, and other elements. In summary, translating a text from English to Russian requires a deep understanding of both languages, strong language skills, and cultural knowledge. To accurately translate the text \\"A\\" into Russian, it's essential to know the context and content of the source material. Should you provide this information, I would be able to give you an accurate translation."},{"question":"What would be an example of an negative review?","response":"Title: Terrible Experience - Do Not Recommend! I hate to be the one to write negative reviews, but my experience with this company was so disappointing that I feel compelled to share it with others. I recently visited their store, XYZ Gadgets, hoping to find a new Bluetooth speaker for my home. Upon entering, I was taken aback by the disorganized shelves and an unmistakable mess throughout. To begin, the customer service was abysmal. From the moment I entered the store, employees were nowhere to be found. After spending about 10 minutes browsing their chaotic inventory, I eventually managed to find a staff member. Unfortunately, this person seemed more interested in attending to their phone than assisting a customer. When I finally got their attention, they appeared to have little-to-no knowledge about the products in the store or any recommendations for a Bluetooth speaker. Additionally, the prices were unreasonably high compared to other retailers. I did manage to find a speaker that caught my attention, but when I checked the price online, I found that the store had an outsized markup. This, coupled with the abhorrent customer service, left such a sour taste that I couldn't justify making the purchase. Another issue that further added to the negative experience was the lack of cleanliness in the store. The floors were dirty, and dust covered a number of product displays. It's hard to have confidence in a store's merchandise when it's presented in an unkempt environment. A clean and well-maintained space would have made a significant difference in my perception of the store and its offerings. Finally, the checkout experience was cumbersome and inefficient. After deciding to purchase an item that I wouldn't find elsewhere, I stood in a long line for a considerable amount of time due to only one cashier being available. When my turn finally arrived, the cashier seemed uninterested in providing a positive customer experience and made no effort to engage in polite conversation. The entire process felt tedious and unnecessarily drawn out. In summary, my experience at XYZ Gadgets was exceedingly disappointing. The combination of poor customer service, unsanitary conditions, high prices, and an inefficient checkout process has led me to lose faith in this company completely. I will not give them any business in the future, and I caution others to think twice before doing so themselves. There are plenty of better options out there with competitive prices, knowledgeable staff, and a commitment to providing excellent customer experiences."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Trump probably feels that he should go forward with the plan despite some polls indicating it is viewed negatively because... Options: - He needs any kind of tax plan to remain president - not enough information - The people that voted for him like it - He needs the money to help accomplish his executive goals === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"The people that voted for him like it Step 1: Analyze the given question and paragraph. The question asks about Trump's reasoning for going forward with the tax cut plan despite negative views in some polls. Step 2: Identify relevant information in the paragraph. Key information includes Trump's base sticking to him with 84% of Republicans supporting him, Trump believing that tax cuts will lead to economic growth and job creation, and Trump's desire for a significant legislative achievement. Step 3: Evaluate each option with respect to the relevant information. Option 1: He needs any kind of tax plan to remain president - This option is irrelevant as there is no evidence in the given paragraph that Trump's presidency depends on enacting any tax plan. Option 2: Not enough information - This option is not helpful since it does not answer the main question. Option 3: The people that voted for him like it - This option is consistent with the information provided, particularly the portion about 84% of Republicans supporting him and Trump's desire to deliver on campaign promises. Option 4: He needs the money to help accomplish his executive goals - This option doesn't directly address the reason for going forward with the plan despite negative views in some polls.

A:","response":"Step 1: Understand the given sentence Understanding the sentence \\"someone gropes for the stoic someone\\" is important to identify the context or previous statement. Here, 'grope' typically means to feel about uncertainly; 'stoic' is a person who endures pain without showing their feelings or complaining. So the sentence is about a person trying to find or understand another person who is stoic, hides their feelings, or does not express their emotions or problems. Step 2: Generating the most likely previous scenario Considering the given sentence, I am assuming that the previous scenario involves some kind of emotional or psychological discussions among individuals. A situation could arise where one person has difficulty understanding another person's stoic personality or behavior. Based on this I will work on developing a previous statement. Step 3: Creating the previous statement The previous statement will set up the context for the existing sentence. Keeping in mind that the sentence is suggesting difficulty understanding a stoic person, the previous statement might set up this scenario. So, here is a likely context or previous statement: \\"During a profound conversation about feelings and emotions, an individual finds it challenging to comprehend the actions and reactions of another.\\" This statement provides a setup that leads into the subsequent sentence, \\"Someone gropes for the stoic someone\\", as it shows the scenario leading to an individual's attempt to understand a stoic person."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - The Film Festival Locarno is an international film festival held annually in August in the city of Locarno, Switzerland since 1946. Locarno is a film festival accredited by the FIAPF (International Federation of Film Producers Associations). The main feature of the festival is the open-air screening area at the Piazza Grande with room for over 8,000 spectators, having one of the largest open-air screens in the world (26x14 metres). - The Legacy ( French : La donation ) is a 2009 film directed by Bernard Émond . The film received the Special Grand Prize of Youth Jury and the Don Quixote Award of the Locarno International Film Festival . It will also compete at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009 . - The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF, stylized as tiff.) is one of the largest publicly attended film festivals in the world, attracting over 480,000 people annually. Over the last 40 years, TIFF has grown to become a year-round destination for film culture operating out of the TIFF Bell Lightbox, a dynamic centre for film culture that offers visitors a presentation that includes new releases, live film events and an interactive gallery. - Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is a code of conduct associated with the medieval institution of knighthood which developed between 1170 and 1220. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, especially the Matter of Britain and Matter of France, the former based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\" which introduced the legend of King Arthur, written in the 1130s. - The story follows the adventures of a hidalgo named Mr. Alonso Quixano who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his sanity and decides to set out to revive chivalry, undo wrongs, and bring justice to the world, under the name \\"Don Quixote de la Mancha\\". He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical orations on antiquated knighthood. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story. Throughout the novel, Cervantes uses such literary techniques as realism, metatheatre, and intertextuality. It had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas' \\"The Three Musketeers\\" (1844), Mark Twain's \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (1884) and Edmond Rostand's \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" (1897), as well as the word \\"quixotic\\" and the epithet \\"Lothario\\". Arthur Schopenhauer cited \\"Don Quixote\\" as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with \\"Tristram Shandy\\", \\"La Nouvelle Héloïse\\" and \\"Wilhelm Meister\\". - Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels (\\"Tom Sawyer Abroad\\" and \\"Tom Sawyer, Detective\\"). It is a direct sequel to \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\". - TIFF Bell Lightbox is a cultural centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in the first five floors of the Bell Lightbox and Festival Tower on the north west corner of King Street and John Street. It is the headquarters for the Toronto International Film Festival. - As a literary genre of high culture, romance or chivalric romance is a type of prose and verse narrative that was popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled adventures, often of a knight-errant portrayed as having heroic qualities, who goes on a quest, yet it is \\"the emphasis on love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the \\"chanson de geste\\" and other kinds of epic, in which masculine military heroism predominates.\\" Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with ironic, satiric or burlesque intent. Romances reworked legends, fairy tales, and history to suit the readers' and hearers' tastes, but by c. 1600 they were out of fashion, and Miguel de Cervantes famously burlesqued them in his novel \\"Don Quixote\\". Still, the modern image of \\"medieval\\" is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word \\"medieval\\" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and other romantic tropes.

The reviewer's strong negative sentiment (-6 stars) for the DVD is a red flag and implies that the current release format may not meet customers' expectations or standards. 3. The suggestion to either track down the widescreen versions or wait for a better release indicates that the current product may not be the best option available to truly experience the series. In conclusion, this review would increase the chances of buying the product based on the quality and overall experience of the series. However, it would decrease the chances due to the dissatisfaction with the DVD release format and the suggestion to pursue other ways to access the series. A potential buyer may opt to search for a different format or release of the series that might provide a more satisfying visual experience so as not to compromise the enjoyment of the highly-rated content."},{"question":"Solve 8*f - 13*f - 10 = 0 for f.. What is the answer??","response":"To solve the given equation, we first need to combine the terms containing the variable f, which in this case is 8f and -13f. The equation is: 8f - 13f - 10 = 0 Now, combining the like terms: (8f - 13f) - 10 = 0 This simplifies to: -5f - 10 = 0 Now, we need to isolate f. To do this, let's get rid of the constant term, which is -10. We will add 10 to both sides of the equation: -5f - 10 + 10 = 0 + 10 This simplifies to: -5f = 10 Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -5 to solve for f: f = 10 / -5 And the solution is: f = -2 So, the answer to the equation 8f - 13f - 10 = 0 is f = -2."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many people and households are in the county according to the census?","response":"Title: People and Households: Numbers from the County Census Hello little friends!

The story begins earlier this week, when The New York Times published a report on Comet Ping Pong, a Washington DC pizza place that a false news item on social media had pegged as the center of a child-abuse ring run by Hillary Clinton and her campaign head John Podesta, despite a lack of any evidence. Following that report, Reddit took steps to shut down the \\"r/Pizzagate\\" subreddit community, which had the stated goal of proving the existence of a conspiracy centering on Comet Ping Pong. \\"We don't want witchhunts on our site,\\" says the warning that replaced the Pizzagate page on Reddit. The move to shut down r/Pizzagate proved controversial to users of \\"r/The_Donald,\\" Reddit's most popular community for supporters of Donald Trump. Those users repeatedly left comments to the effect of \\"f**k u/spez\\" and other forms of abuse, including Huffman's \\"u/spez\\" Reddit name in the post to make sure he was notified of each new message. On Wednesday afternoon, members of \\"The_Donald\\" noticed that their posts had changed without their knowledge or consent: Instead of referencing Huffman himself, the posts now hurled the same expletives at the moderators of the \\"The_Donald\\" community. Angry \\"The _Donald\\" members accused Reddit leadership of modifying or otherwise censoring their posts — which turned out to be correct, when Huffman posted the following comment, confessing that it was him personally who was performing the changes (with expletives taken out): \\"Hey Everyone, Yep. I messed with the \\"f**k u/spez \\" comments, replacing \\"spez\\" with r/the_donald mods for about an hour. It's been a long week here trying to unwind the r/pizzagate stuff.

In contrast, organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles. - Phototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from stimulus of light. This is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite. - In cell biology, an organelle is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function. Individual organelles are usually separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayers. - A taxis (plural taxes , from the Ancient Greek , meaning \\"arrangement\\") is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus such as light or the presence of food. Taxes are innate behavioral responses. A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and demonstrates guided movement towards or away from the stimulus source. It is sometimes distinguished from a kinesis, a non-directional change in activity in response to a stimulus. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - Saltern is a word with a number of differing (but interrelated) meanings. In English archaeology, a saltern is an area used for salt making, especially in the East Anglian fenlands. - Peripheral membrane proteins are membrane proteins that adhere only temporarily to the biological membrane with which they are associated. These proteins attach to integral membrane proteins, or penetrate the peripheral regions of the lipid bilayer. The regulatory protein subunits of many ion channels and transmembrane receptors, for example, may be defined as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast to integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins tend to collect in the water-soluble component, or fraction, of all the proteins extracted during a protein purification procedure. Proteins with GPI anchors are an exception to this rule and can have purification properties similar to those of integral membrane proteins. - Globular proteins or spheroproteins are spherical (\\"globe-like\\") proteins and are one of the common protein types (the others being fibrous, disordered and membrane proteins). Globular proteins are somewhat water-soluble (forming colloids in water), unlike the fibrous or membrane proteins. There are multiple fold classes of globular proteins, since there are many different architectures that can fold into a roughly spherical shape. - Phototrophs (\\"Gr\\": , = light, = nourishment) are the organisms that carry out photon capture to acquire energy. They use the energy from light to carry out various cellular metabolic processes. It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily photosynthetic. Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they anabolically convert carbon dioxide into organic material to be utilized structurally, functionally, or as a source for later catabolic processes (e.g. in the form of starches, sugars and fats). All phototrophs either use electron transport chains or direct proton pumping to establish an electro-chemical gradient which is utilized by ATP synthase, to provide the molecular energy currency for the cell. Phototrophs can be either autotrophs or heterotrophs. - Sensory rhodopsin II ( SRII ) , also known as pharaonis phoborhodopsin ( ppR ) , is a membrane protein of archaea , responsible for generation of phototaxis signal . Sensory rhodopsin II is found in Halobacterium salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis - Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation). This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water hence the name \\"photosynthesis\\", from the Greek , \\"phs\\", \\"light\\", and , \\"synthesis\\", \\"putting together\\". In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - An integral membrane protein (IMP) is a type of membrane protein that is permanently attached to the biological membrane. All transmembrane proteins are IMPs, but not all IMPs are transmembrane proteins. IMPs comprise a significant fraction of the proteins encoded in an organism's genome. Proteins that cross the membrane are surrounded by \\"annular\\" lipids (see annular lipid shell), which are defined as lipids that are in direct contact with a membrane protein. Such proteins can be separated from the biological membranes only using detergents, nonpolar solvents, or sometimes denaturing agents. - In modern molecular biology and genetics, a genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts. - A biological membrane or biomembrane is an enclosing or separating membrane that acts as a selectively permeable barrier within living things. Biological membranes, in the form of cell membranes, often consist of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded, integral and peripheral proteins used in communication and transportation of chemicals and ions. Bulk lipid in membrane provides a fluid matrix for proteins to rotate and laterally diffuse for physiological functioning. Proteins are adapted to high membrane fluidity environment of lipid bilayer with the presence of an annular lipid shell, consisting of lipid molecules bound tightly to surface of integral membrane proteins. The cellular membranes should not be confused with isolating tissues formed by layers of cells, such as mucous membranes and basement membranes. - Salt pork is salt-cured pork. It is prepared from one of three primal cuts: pork side, pork belly, or fatback. Depending on the cut, respectively, salt pork may be lean, streaky or entirely fatty. Made from the same cuts as bacon, salt pork resembles uncut slab bacon, but is considerably saltier and not bacon-cured or smoked. It is thus virtually identical to the Ukrainian food \\"salo\\", which also displays similar variation in meat-to-fat ratio. Long used as a shipboard ration, salt pork now finds use in traditional American cuisine, particularly Boston baked beans, pork and beans, and to add its flavor to vegetables cooked in water, or with greens as in soul food. It is also central to the flavoring of clam chowder. It generally is cut and cooked (blanched or rendered) before use. - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. - The lipid bilayer (or phospholipid bilayer) is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, even though they are only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps. - In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. \\"nuclei\\"; from Latin or , meaning \\"kernel\\" or \\"seed\\") is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others have many. - Membrane proteins are proteins that interact with, or are part of, biological membranes. They include integral membrane proteins that are permanently anchored or part of the membrane and peripheral membrane proteins that are only temporarily attached to the lipid bilayer or to other integral proteins. The integral membrane proteins are classified as transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane and integral monotopic proteins that are attached to only one side of the membrane. Membrane proteins are a common type of proteins along with soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. It is estimated that 2030% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins. - Halobacterium salinarum is an extremely halophilic marine Gram-negative obligate aerobic archaeon. Despite its name, this microorganism is not a bacterium, but rather a member of the domain Archaea. It is found in salted fish, hides, hypersaline lakes, and salterns. As these salterns reach the minimum salinity limits for extreme halophiles, their waters become purple or reddish color due to the high densities of halophilic Archaea. \\"H. salinarum\\" has also been found in high-salt food such as salt pork, marine fish, and sausages. The ability of \\"H. salinarum\\" to survive at such high salt concentrations has led to its classification as an extremophile.

Today, we are going to talk about something very important for all of us who love playing in the park and enjoying nature. Sometimes, when you go to the park, you might see people walking their doggies. Dogs are wonderful and playful friends, but they also need to go potty, just like us! When dogs go potty in the park, their owners should always clean up after them by picking up the dog's poop. Many dog owners use plastic bags to do this. But guess what? We need to make sure they throw these plastic bags in the trash! Otherwise, it can cause harm to other animals living in the park. A sad thing happened in a park in a faraway place called Leicestershire. A deer, which is a lovely and graceful animal, ate many of those plastic bags! Oh no! The poor deer had a tummy full of plastic, and that is not good for any animal. When we go to the park and see people walking their dogs, we must all remember to tell our parents, siblings, or friends to make sure they clean up the doggy poop and throw those plastic bags into a bin. By doing this, we can keep our park clean and protect the animals that live there. In the end, all of us - kids, grown-ups, dogs, and the animals that live in the park - can continue to enjoy the beautiful park and stay healthy and happy. So, always remind each other to take care of our lovely parks and the wonderful creatures that live there. Remember, kids: Be kind to nature, and nature will be kind to you!"},{"question":"First question: What parties should I involve in a technical feasibility study for a large engineering project? Second question: I am studying computer science. What are some good ideas for graduate projects? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"First answer: A technical feasibility study helps us know if a big project can be done successfully. We should involve these parties: 1. Project Manager: They help decide what everyone will do. They're like a team captain! 2. Engineers: They're great at finding out if the project can work and how. They're like builders who make the plan. 3. Financial Expert: They know about money and can tell if the project costs too much. It's like having a piggy-bank helper. 4. Business Analyst: They look at what people need and how the project can help. They're like detectives finding important clues. 5. Environmental Specialist: They make sure the project won't hurt nature. They're like nature guardians taking care of plants and animals. 6. Clients and End-users: They tell us what they want from the project. It's like showing your drawing to your friends to make them happy. Second answer: When studying computer science, you can pick fun projects for graduation, like: 1. Video Game: Make a cool video game that people can play and enjoy. 2. Mobile App: Create a helpful app for phones or tablets that does something useful or fun. 3. Artificial Intelligence: Make a computer think like a human and solve problems or learn new things. 4. Robots: Build a robot that can move around, help people, or do tasks all by itself. 5. Cybersecurity: Learn how to protect computers and networks from bad people trying to steal information. Lastly, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first one asks about the different roles in making a big project work, and the second one asks for ideas for computer science graduating projects. Think of the first question as creating a team to plan a big project in general, and the second question is finding a fun project to complete for your computer science studies."},{"question":"Jesse looked the part in the play they were putting on.

The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. - The Equator usually refers to an imaginary line on the Earth's surface equidistant from the North Pole and South Pole, dividing the Earth into the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. The Equator is about long; some 78.7% lies across water and 21.3% over land. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - Lake Edward, Rutanzige or Edward Nyanza is the smallest of the African Great Lakes. It is located in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda, with its northern shore a few kilometres south of the equator. - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World). - The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world by area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and depth.

With nearly 100 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populous nation on the African continent after Nigeria. It occupies a total area of , and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa. - Lake Victoria (' in Luo; ' in Luganda; \\"\\" in Kinyarwanda and some Bantu languages) is one of the African Great Lakes. The lake was named after Queen Victoria by the explorer John Hanning Speke, the first Briton to document it. Speke accomplished this in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton to locate the source of the Nile River. - The Kazinga Channel in Uganda is a wide , 32 - kilometre ( 20 mi ) long natural channel that links Lake Edward and Lake George , and a dominant feature of Queen Elizabeth National Park . The channel attracts a varied range of animals and birds , with one of the world 's largest concentration of hippos and numerous Nile crocodiles . Lake George is a small lake with an average depth of only 2.4 metres ( 7.9 ft ) and which is fed by streams from the Rwenzori mountains . Its outflow is through the Kazinga Channel which drains into Lake Edward , water levels fluctuating very little . In 2005 , large numbers of hippos were killed in the channel as a result of an anthrax outbreak , which occurs when animals eat remnants of vegetation in the driest months , absorbing bacterial spores that can live for decades in dry soil . - The Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) is Uganda's most visited national park. - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC).

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - contraction - shrinkage - flowering - photosynthesis A: A:","response":"The correct answer is - photosynthesis. Plants require water to carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a crucial process where plants convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities. This process needs water as one of its key components. Therefore, in dry soils where water is insufficient, plants may be unproductive because they won't be able to carry out photosynthesis effectively. The other choices mentioned here - contraction, shrinkage, and flowering are all processes that can occur in plants, but none of them directly relates to a plant's need for water to convert light energy into chemical energy."},{"question":"Instructions: Your task is to generate the next utterance in a given dialogue.

Ministers said the import ban was brought in as soon as it was practical. The environment secretary will chair a summit on ash dieback on Wednesday. The disease has now been confirmed at 82 locations in England and Scotland. On Monday, government officials confirmed that the disease was present in woodlands in Kent and Essex. In the last six weeks, 100,000 ash trees have been destroyed and experts say it may be too late to stop the spread of the fungus. Scientists say the infection in native trees has been caused by a fungus Chalara fraxinea, which is believed to have been carried on the wind from mainland Europe. Unlike animals, trees cannot be vaccinated and once infected, a tree cannot be cured. A plant health order banning imports and the movement of ash trees came into force on 29 October. Mr Ellis, who is considering suing the government for Â£200,000, said by the time his firm was permitted to destroy its trees, many more had become infected. He says the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) wrote to the government in 2009 warning of a new strain of ash dieback disease and urged it to close UK borders. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \\"They should have taken it seriously at the time. They chose not to and now we have this really dramatic situation. \\"Effectively our income stream starts now, this is the season, this is our harvest time so to cut off our income stream - what other course of action can we take?\\" Here to stay? The HTA says the government misdiagnosed the disease when it first alerted officials - the fungus was thought to be the same as one already widespread in the UK. The HTA's Tim Briercliffe said: \\"We saw the disease, we saw what it was doing in Denmark. It wasn't doing that in the UK. Whatever the details of the science were saying, that surely was going to speak far louder.\\" By Mark KinverEnvironment reporter, BBC News Known as the common or European ash, the tree - the UK's only native ash species - is scientifically known as Fraxinus excelsior. It is the UK's third most abundant species of broadleaf tree (after oak and birch), covering 129,000 hectares of woodland. Ash is deemed to be a very important species within the UK's hedgerows and accounts for about for about 10% of the nation's estimated 123 million \\"non-woodland\\" trees. The common ash is a large deciduous tree that can reach heights in excess of 40 metres (130ft). It can live up to 400 years but coppiced trees can live for centuries longer. The species is wind pollinated, and the seeds (known as keys) are primarily dispersed by the wind. As the species is long-lived, it is important for wildlife. It supports specialist deadwood species, such as the lesser stag beetle and hole nesting birds, including owls and woodpeckers. Ash woodlands have light, open canopies, so are an important habitat for flora such as bluebells and ramsoms. Birds like bullfinches feed on the trees' seeds. Also, ash provides an important habitat for more than a quarter of Britain's lichen, including nearly 14% of the nationally rare and nationally scarce species. Upland mixed ash woodlands are listed as a priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Farming Today: Ash dieback Martin Ward, the UK's chief plant health officer with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said ash dieback disease was not spreading but acknowledged that \\"we're probably not going eradicate it\\". \\"We have stopped the movement of plants and the sporulation on the leaf litter, which can lead to aerial spread, doesn't happen until the summer,\\" he said. \\"The increasing number of cases we are recording at the moment is the result of greater information, more knowledge of the distribution of the disease.\\" He told Today when the disease was first identified in UK nursery stock in March this year the \\"important thing then was to track down that... stock, to destroy these isolated findings in recent plantings\\". Defra then worked on identifying the \\"right measures\\" to be taken before the start of the planting season. The government has ruled out paying compensation. A spokesman for Defra said: \\"Hundreds of staff members from government agencies have been investigating sites across the UK. \\"They have examined around 2,500 blocks of land, each 10 kilometres square, where mature ash trees are known to be present, in order to seek out traces of the disease in our established trees. \\"At a time when our trees face increasing threat from a range of diseases, and in a tight financial climate, we believe that resources are best spent on surveillance and trying to tackle the disease.\\" The prime minister's official spokesman has confirmed that Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will host a summit on ash dieback on Wednesday. How to spot the signs He said the meeting, involving tree health experts and other \\"key stakeholders\\", would provide updates on the problem and what was being done to tackle it. \\"We are taking this issue very seriously,\\" he added. \\"What is important is that we focus on the action we can take now to try and limit the effects of the disease.\\" He acknowledged that there were questions about how the government handles \\"different animal and plant diseases\\". \\"That is why Owen Paterson set up this taskforce to look at how we handle plant diseases,\\" he told journalists. \\"One of its jobs is to ensure that we are as well prepared as we can be in the future to deal with this kind of problem.\\" On the issue of compensating affected horticultural businesses, he said that it would be \\"dealt with ultimately by the courts\\".","response":"Ash dieback is a disease found in ash trees, and it's getting worse in the UK.

While the lever is in its lowest position, it should prevent the wheels from moving. On some stroller models, the front wheels may also have a locking mechanism to prevent them from swiveling. First, push the stroller a few paces forward to put the wheels in the forward position. Then, look for a small lever between the front wheels. If present, it may need to be pushed up or down, depending on the model, to lock the wheels in position. Tug gently on the canopy, if opened, to pull it back into folded position.

Article: An Australian inventor has designed and built an environmentally friendly ferry that uses solar and wind power to transport people around Sydney Harbor. Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor were given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards recently. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \\"We angle our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\\" Dane says. \\"And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\\" Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \\"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\\" Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves. \\"When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,\\" he says. Question: We can learn from the passage _ . - the ferry sails at a speed of 7.5 kilometers an hour - the ferry is good for the environment - four sources of energy for the ferry are controlled by Dane - solar energy needn't be stored in case of good weather Answer:","response":"the ferry is good for the environment"},{"question":"Question: Discarded electronic devices, such as outdated computers and cell phones, contain materials that can be toxic to the environment.

Bob Taft (R) yesterday pleaded no contest to charges that he violated state ethics laws, becoming the first governor in the state's history convicted of a crime and providing powerful ammunition to Democrats seeking to break the Republican Party's dominance in a critical swing state. For the past decade, Democrats have been in retreat in the Buckeye State. Republicans have won the governor's office for four consecutive terms, control both houses of the legislature and hold the other major statewide offices. Last year, Ohio was ground zero in the presidential campaign and provided the crucial electoral votes that secured President Bush's reelection victory. Political analysts said yesterday that the spreading scandal that put Taft in a Columbus courthouse, as well as public dissatisfaction over an economy whose unemployment rate is above the national average, leaves Republicans vulnerable for a potential housecleaning in next year's elections. \\"Potentially, it could be a very tough year,\\" said Eric W. Rademacher, co-director of the University of Cincinnati's Ohio Poll. Taft, who cooperated with investigators, issued a public apology after being convicted on four misdemeanor counts for failing to report 52 golf outings, dinners and other entertainment gifts. He was fined 4,000, the maximum. Taft, who by law cannot run again, said he will not resign. \\"There are no words to express the deep remorse that I feel over the embarrassment that I have caused for my administration and for the people of the state of Ohio,\\" Taft said after the sentencing. \\"I offer my sincere and heartfelt apology, and I hope the people will understand that these mistakes, though major and important mistakes, were done unintentionally, and I hope and pray they will accept my apology.\\" Among the golf outings were two from Tom Noe, a prominent Republican fundraiser and rare coin dealer who is at the heart of a larger scandal involving the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, which invested approximately 50 million in rare coins through Noe. Investigators later found 10 million to 13 million was missing, sending GOP officials scampering to escape the taint of association with Noe. The Taft name is one of the most storied in the history of Republican politics. His father and grandfather were both U.S. senators, and his great-grandfather, William Howard Taft, served both as president and as chief justice of the United States. But in office, Taft has struggled constantly. With the news of his reporting failures, his approval rating has plunged below 20 percent, the lowest of any governor in the nation. Republicans blamed Taft's unpopularity and the coin scandal for the surprisingly close outcome in a special House election in southwest Ohio this month. In that race, Democrat Paul Hackett, an Iraq war veteran and harsh critic of Bush, came within 5,000 votes of defeating Republican Jean Schmidt in a district Bush won with 64 percent of the vote. Rademacher said the challenge for Republicans next year will be to convince voters that the problems that have left them so unhappy are the fault of the Taft administration, not the GOP itself. \\"One of the real questions for all of us for next year is . . . whether or not their focus is on the governor's office or all the statewide offices up for election next year,\\" he said. The Democrats' top priorities appear to be the governor's office and the office of secretary of state, which oversees elections and which became a focal point of Democrats' anger last year because the incumbent, Republican J. Kenneth Blackwell, also chaired the Bush-Cheney campaign in the state. Congressional Democrats also are targeting Republican Rep. Robert W. Ney, whose association with indicted Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff has tied him to charges of GOP corruption. On Wednesday, Chillicothe Mayor Joseph P. Sulzer, a Democrat, announced his candidacy for the House seat. Senate Democratic campaign officials have been seeking to recruit someone to run against Republican Sen. Mike DeWine, but on Wednesday, heavily recruited Rep. Sherrod Brown announced he would not run. Some grass-roots Democrats want Hackett to run for the Senate. However vulnerable Republicans may be, Democrats can't count on scandal alone to change their fortunes. \\"Their party structure is not well funded or well organized,\\" said John C. Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. \\"Even if the situation turned out to be very bad for the Republicans next year, from the vantage point of today, it would seem unlikely that the Democrats would sweep a large proportion of the offices.\\"","response":"Ohio Governor Bob Taft pleaded no contest to charges of violating state ethics laws, making him the first governor in Ohio's history to be convicted of a crime.

By studying all night, they demonstrated their determination and commitment to achieving academic success. By investing their time and effort into preparing for the test, Sasha was able to develop the necessary knowledge and skills to excel on it. It is important to note that preparation for a test involves much more than simply memorizing facts or formulae. True understanding is derived from actively engaging with the material, asking questions, and seeking to comprehend the underlying principles and concepts. The best way to prepare for a test is to review and practice working through problems related to the topics covered. This not only helps with retaining information but also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. On the other hand, being smart or being rich does not guarantee a person's success on a test. Intelligence may allow someone to grasp concepts more quickly than others, but it does not mean they will automatically perform well on a test without adequate preparation.

The 33-year-old reality star from McIntyre, Georgia, now a mother-of-four, first asked relatives if they would take the baby while pregnant, sister-in-law Janice Shannon has apparently said. June is said to have then 'abandoned' Anna, then seven, at the home of her mother, Sandra Hale, in order to 'move into a trailer with a boyfriend'.

Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"as he gets cold, his mother asks him to drink more cold water\\" - Sentence B: \\"as he gets cold, his mother asks him to drink more hot water\\"","response":"Sentence A is against common sense. The explanation is as follows: When someone gets cold, it is a common practice to try to warm them up instead of making them even colder. Drinking cold water would lower their body temperature, making them feel colder and potentially leading to further discomfort or, in extreme cases, hypothermia. On the other hand, drinking hot water helps in raising the body temperature, providing warmth and comfort in the cold situation. Therefore, Sentence A, which suggests that the mother asks her son to drink cold water when he is already cold, goes against common sense. Sentence B aligns with common sense, as it suggests that the mother asks her son to drink hot water when he is cold to help him feel warmer."},{"question":"Q:The husband never worked a day, but after getting divorced received alimony, what did he become as a result? - emotional distress - bad feelings - richer - depression - guilty The best answer is A:","response":"The best answer is: richer After receiving alimony from the divorce, the husband became richer.

The premise focuses on describing alternative entertainment options within the Casino complex for those who are not interested in gambling, mentioning the Copacabana Bar and Rio Restaurant as places to enjoy live music, cabaret dinner shows, and Brazilian samba extravaganzas. To determine whether gambling is a more profitable way to spend one's time, several factors need to be considered, such as: 1. Personal preferences and interests: People have different preferences and interests. Some may enjoy gambling, while others are more likely to have a good time watching live music or cabaret shows. It is important to consider one's individual preferences in evaluating the profitability of an activity. 2. Skill level and experience in gambling: A person's skill level and experience in gambling can significantly impact their profitability. A highly skilled and experienced gambler may be more likely to make a profit compared to someone with little to no experience. 3. Types of games and odds: Casinos offer various games with different odds and house edges. Some games, such as blackjack or poker, can offer better odds for skilled players, while others, like slot machines, might have a higher house edge. The odds of winning a particular game also play a crucial role in determining the profitability of gambling. 4. Money management and budget: A person's ability to manage their money and stick to a budget can affect the outcome of their gambling endeavors. By setting limits and knowing when to walk away, a gambler can potentially minimize losses and maximize any potential profits. 5. Entertainment value: In addition to the potential for financial profit, it is essential to consider the entertainment value of each activity. For some people, the thrill of gambling might be worth more than the cost of potential losses, while others may derive more pleasure from watching live performances or dining at a themed restaurant. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we cannot determine if gambling at the Casino is a more profitable way to spend one's time. A thorough analysis of personal preferences, skill levels, game odds, and other factors would be necessary to make a more accurate conclusion."},{"question":"\\"Canidae represents the biological family of dog like carnivorans.\\" Is the above claim true?

The term 'ill' refers to a state of poor health, or a condition in which an individual's physical, mental, or emotional well-being is adversely affected. Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that can be found almost everywhere on Earth, including in soil, water, plants, animals, and humans. While many bacteria are harmless or even beneficial to humans, there are certain types of bacteria that are pathogens, meaning they can invade the human body and cause infections and illnesses. The mechanism through which bacteria cause people to become ill typically involves the bacteria entering the human body, multiplying, and releasing harmful substances called toxins. These toxins can damage tissue, cause inflammation, and interfere with the normal functioning of the body. When the immune system detects the presence of bacteria, it mounts a defense to try to eliminate the infection, which can also contribute to the symptoms of illness. Some examples of bacterial infections include strep throat (caused by Streptococcus bacteria), urinary tract infections (caused by Escherichia coli, or E. coli), and pneumonia (caused by several bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae). Bacterial infections can be mild, moderate, or severe, and they can affect various parts of the body, such as the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract. The symptoms of bacterial infections can vary widely depending on the type of bacteria and the part of the body that is affected. Some common symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, pain, swelling, redness, and the presence of pus or other discharge. Bacterial infections can also lead to more serious complications, such as sepsis (a life-threatening systemic response to infection), organ damage, or long-term health problems. To treat bacterial infections, doctors typically prescribe antibiotics, which are medications that work by killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth. It is important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a healthcare professional to ensure that the infection is completely eradicated and to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In addition to antibiotics, other supportive treatments such as rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers or fever reducers may be recommended to help alleviate symptoms. Preventing bacterial infections includes practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, properly cooking and storing food to avoid foodborne illnesses, and keeping wounds clean and covered. Additional preventive measures may include getting vaccinated against certain bacterial infections, such as pneumococcal pneumonia, and avoiding close contact with individuals who have contagious bacterial infections. In summary, bacteria can cause people to become ill by invading the body, multiplying, and releasing harmful toxins that damage tissue and interfere with normal bodily functions. The resulting illnesses can range in severity and affect various parts of the body. Treatment typically involves antibiotics in combination with other supportive measures, and prevention strategies include good hygiene practices and receiving appropriate vaccinations."},{"question":"Review: pitifully few real laughs Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","response":"This movie review sentence is negative.

Translate to English","response":"We must look outward and begin developing our true technological strengths. In today's rapidly advancing world, it is crucial for individuals, businesses, and nations alike to continuously develop and harness their technological strengths in order to remain competitive and relevant in the global arena. Acknowledging this, we must turn our focus outward and seek areas where our true strengths and potential lie, so that we can embark on a journey of innovation and progress. To begin developing our true technological strengths, we must first identify the areas where we excel or have the potential to excel. Some countries, for instance, are gifted with abundant natural resources that give them an advantage in specific sectors, such as renewable energy or mineral extraction. Others have a well-established education system and a vibrant research community that foster innovation and technological advancement. By identifying and harnessing these strengths, we can pave the way for long-term development and success. Once we have determined our areas of expertise, it is time to invest in research and development (R&D). This involves both the public and private sectors coming together to allocate resources towards the pursuit of groundbreaking technologies. Governments must play a key role in providing funding, creating supportive policies, and investing in education and training programs that produce a skilled workforce capable of driving technological progress. Simultaneously, the private sector can contribute by investing in technologies that push the boundaries of current capabilities, encouraging innovation and cutting-edge advancements. In addition, collaboration and cooperation between different stakeholders must be promoted. This includes partnerships between academic institutions, research organizations, and industries. When these entities work together, they create a synergy that accelerates the development of new technologies and products. Moreover, international collaboration can also play a vital role in enhancing our technological capabilities, as it allows nations to exchange knowledge, resources, and best practices, leading to faster progress and mutual growth. Furthermore, we should also focus on creating a culture of innovation and embracing failure as a natural part of the learning process. This means nurturing a mindset that encourages problem-solving, resilience, and curiosity. By fostering such an environment, we are better equipped to think outside the box and find new ways of tackling challenges. Lastly, we must prioritize the development of a strong tech ecosystem that allows for the commercialization of new technologies and for startups to thrive. This includes access to funding, mentorship, and support networks, as well as streamlined processes and policies that make it easier for entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to life. In conclusion, developing our true technological strengths requires looking outward and identifying areas of expertise, investing in R&D, fostering collaboration, creating a culture of innovation, and building a supportive tech ecosystem. By taking these steps, we can ensure that we remain competitive in the global marketplace and on the cutting edge of technological advancement."},{"question":"Район плавания – р.

Alas, I'm a 40-something midwesterner in town for a business conference. And this demographic is not catered to at MGM. MGM is a solid resort; the rooms were very nice, and except for the 2-inch shard of glass my bare foot discovered by the bed, the room was tasteful, clean and altogether pleasant. Check-in was relatively fast & courteous. (My conference was at Mandalay Bay but I've been there before and wanted to experience someplace new.) The clientele were generally friendly, provided each sentence included at least some level of profanity and the topic of conversation revolved around the latest DJ spinning at Wet Republic. Not knowing any DJs, anywhere, I was quite the old square. (Notice all the reviews here mentioning DJs? I rest my case.). MGM provided free wifi which is nice. This was appreciated by the groups of young zombies who sat together, each staring into their respective smartphones rather than conversing. The pool is truly amazing and has something for everyone. The lazy river caters to those re-living spring break while the other pools were excellent for lounging or getting wet. The bartenders around the pools were friendly and helpful but the young ladies in short-shorts carrying beer buckets to the loudly inebriated were not. I'm reluctant to call them servers or waitresses as I spent 2 days by the pool and lazy river and was not once asked if I'd like a drink despite waving my arms like a maniac. The casino was clean and inviting. I'm a craps guy & the tables were good with a mixed crowd that was generally fun to play with and only occasionally interrupted by the obnoxious clientele. The night life at MGM generally caters to 3 demographics; a) the young, fat ghetto chick stuffed into a tiny dress that barely, but not always, covered their butt; b) amazingly beautiful 20-something women waiting for someone to notice them so that they could ignore them; and c) hordes of young, loud gangsta wannabes trailing after either group. (I am not a club goer; this is merely my observation from the clientele parading thru the casino to wait in line for 3 hours outside of Hakesan. This had the unfortunate affect of transforming Centrifuge from my hope of an upscale lounge into a kiddie waiting room.) The women I didn't speak with were either category A or B as described above, and neither would give you the time of day, even if you were innocently just asking for the time of day; the very definition of pretentious. (Lest you think I'm just an old fatty, I'm a former collegiate athlete & ran the Tough Mudder just for kicks before my conference.) Whisky Down was a great little side bar that made outstanding cocktails; well made with fine ingredients. The clientele here were generally retired, which though not my generation, was a welcome relief to the hip-hop. The restaurants were outstanding. The beef tartar and lobster bisque at Craftsteak is worth killing for...which was nearly the case because if that 25ish chap in the ill-advised suit had slumped any further from his stool & spilled my soup... The Tap sports bar did what sports should do, provided a good burger, beer and a couple hours repose to enjoy the game. A couple of pilsners helped improve my disposition despite the 2 surly \\"ladies\\" next to me at the bar. \\"Excuse me, is this seat taken?\\" \\"Hmmph\\" with eye roll. Despite their obvious inebriation, they were able to cheer on the Blackhawks with a very colorful vocabulary. I must add the disclaimer that Vegas is a late night town and most of my experience was before midnight. That said, returning to MGM about 12 on a couple nights, the demographic I mention previously did not diversify but simply multiplied. MGM is not a bad place at all, it simply was not a place suited to my tastes. If you're a twenty-something, hardcore partier, rock on! & enjoy the MGM. If you're a 30/40-something professional, pay the extra price for a more upscale, mature locale. What is the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is mixed.

You do not have to limit yourself to a certain type of fabric to make a great tie, but heavier fabrics do tend to wear better. For one tie, you'll need at least 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric for the front of the tie and about 5 x 6 inches of fabric for the back liner. Silk is a popular choice for tie liners. For a casual tie, go for patterned cotton, linen or denim. Ties are made with a material called interfacing, which is sewn or ironed into the inside of the tie as a liner. It allows fabrics to keep a firm shape. You will need 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric. For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on. Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie. In addition to the fabric and interfacing, you will need to buy the following supplies: Fine thread that matches the tie fabric A good pair of fabric scissors Either a needle (if you're sewing the tie by hand) or a sewing machine Straight pins Measuring tape Iron There are many tie patterns available for you to choose from. Once you find a style you like, you can print the outline for it online for free. The alternative to printing a tie outline would be to use a ruler to trace another tie out yourself. When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric. You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam.

Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Sentence A: \\"Dad is surfing on the desert\\" - Surfing typically requires water or a wave-like surface to ride on - Deserts are characterized by their aridity and lack of water, therefore they do not offer the necessary conditions for surfing - Conclusion: Surfing on a desert appears illogical unless it refers to the concept of sandboarding, however the statement uses the word \\"surfing\\" which leads to the understanding that it is implausible. Sentence B: \\"Dad is surfing on the sea\\" - The sea is a body of water that provides a suitable environment for surfing - Surfing was developed as a recreational activity to ride on waves in the ocean - Conclusion: Surfing on the sea is a logical and common activity, as it aligns with the traditional understanding of surfing. After analyzing both sentences, it is clear that Sentence A: \\"Dad is surfing on the desert\\" is the sentence that is not logical."},{"question":"Given the question: Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill.

Language learning brings numerous benefits: it improves cognitive skills, enhances understanding of different cultures, and opens up new professional opportunities. Still, it's true that learning a new language isn't easy—it requires perseverance, practice, and a commitment to overcoming the complexities associated with mastering a new linguistic code. The process usually involves acquiring new vocabulary, grappling with new grammatical structures, and practicing pronunciation, among other things. In the case of Spanish, a learner would need to familiarize themselves with gendered grammatical structures (something absent in English), the use of accents to mark word stress, and the use of \\"tú\\" and \\"usted\\" to signify informal and formal 'you' respectively, among other aspects. Learning these new elements can indeed be challenging. In contrast to the difficulties pointed out, learning a new language can also be deeply rewarding. Achieving proficiency offers an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and opens up the ability to communicate with a whole new group of people in their native tongue. One gets to explore previously inaccessible books, music, movies, and cultural practices, and can even gain a new perspective on life.

Greenspan said the “most effective” stimulus would be an increase in stock prices rather than more government spending. He also said he favors raising taxes to curb the federal budget deficit, joining the debate in Congress over whether to extend reductions enacted under President George W. Bush. “We have to find a way to settle down the extent of activism that is currently going on and allow this economy to heal,” Greenspan said. “We would be far better off to allow the normal market forces to operate.” Taxes and spending are dominating the congressional agenda less than two months before elections that will determine control of the House and Senate. President Barack Obama is defending his economic policies against criticism from Republicans, who argue they haven’t been effective and have widened a budget deficit that reached a record 1.42 trillion in 2009. Obama last week proposed a package of 180 billion in business tax breaks and infrastructure spending to boost the economy. That would come on top of the 814 billion stimulus measure enacted last year. Extending Tax Cuts Obama also wants to extend Bush-era tax cuts for individuals who make less than 200,000 a year and couples earning less than 250,000 while repealing them for those who earn more. Republicans want to extend cuts for all taxpayers. Greenspan said raising taxes in a weak economy isn’t an ideal option. “There are risks, but our choice is not between good and bad, it’s between terrible and worse,” he said. “Unless we come to grips with the deficit quickly we’re fooling ourselves as to how much time we have.” A relapse into a recession is unlikely, said Greenspan, 84, who was chairman of the central bank from 1987 to 2006 and didn’t comment on monetary policy in today’s remarks. “What we have going for us is that the tinder for a double dip is not readily available,” he said. Still, he repeated his warning that if housing prices drop, “all bets are off.” Unemployment Rate The economy grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, hampered by an unemployment rate that has stayed above 9 percent all year. The unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in August from 9.5 percent in July. Greenspan cited the level of excess reserves in the banking system as evidence of the uncertainty that’s restraining recovery. As of Sept. 9, U.S. banks have 1.01 trillion in excess reserves. “There is a heavy weight of uncertainty on the system such that we are not getting the impact of a trillion dollars already on the books into the marketplace,” he said, describing the situation as a “liquidity trap.” “Our financial institutions are still partially disabled and will continue to be disabled until we restore a level of capital in the system that enables the average lender to a depository institution to feel secure,” he said. Capital requirements proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision earlier this week are a move in the right direction, he said. “The nature of the regulations that were promulgated by the Basel committee made sense to me,” he said. As Fed chairman in 2001, Greenspan supported the first round of tax cuts under Bush. At the time, the federal government operated with a surplus, and Greenspan told Congress he didn’t think the cuts would lead to a deficit. To contact the reporters for this story: Joshua Zumbrun in Washington at jzumbrun@bloomberg.net; ||||| The former head of the Federal Reserve said fiscal stimulus efforts have fallen far short of expectations, and the government now needs to get out of the way and allow businesses and markets to power the recovery. “We have to find a way to simmer down the extent of activism that is going on” with government stimulus spending “and allow the economy to heal” itself, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a gathering held at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Wednesday. Bloomberg News Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan At this point, “we’d probably be better off doing less than more” because “you’d be far better off to allow the normal market forces to operate here,” Greenspan said. That’s largely because stimulus spending is not proving as effective as many had hoped. “To the extent the evidence suggests very large deficits concurrently crowd out capital investment, there is a debit to the stimulus program that is somewhere between a third and a half of what the gross stimulus is,” he said. Greenspan was Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, and was succeeded by current central bank chief Ben Bernanke. Greenspan’s tenure at the Fed was defined by his opposition to government regulation and his confidence that markets would discipline themselves. To many, the financial crisis was largely born of that ideology, and to some degree, Greenspan has himself said he overestimated the market’s willingness to understand and price for risk. Greenspan has also been widely accused of running an overly easy monetary policy during the early years of the last decade, in turn providing the fuel that powered the housing bubble, the rupturing of which drove the worst recession in generations. Greenspan’s comments came in response to moderator and audience questions, and were accordingly wide-ranging. The former central banker noted that gold, the price of which has been surging, still represents the “ultimate means of payment.” What is happening in that market “is a signal there is a problem with respect to currency markets.” He reckons the problem is not a large one, but the jump in gold prices could be “the canary in the coal mine to keep an eye on.” Greenspan, while worried about the outlook and what is happening with the housing market, said when it comes to a double-dip recession, “the probability of that is going down.” Given all the ground the economy has lost, “the tinder for a double-dip is not readily available,” although he added if housing goes down “all bets are off.” Greenspan said that the U.S. needs to do something now to deal with budget deficits and it must do something very soon. He explained his anxiety is so high that “I’m coming out in the first time in my memory” in support of higher taxes in addition to reduced spending, including allowing the so-called Bush tax cuts to expire. “Our choice is not between good and bad; it’s between terrible and worse,” Greenspan said. The nation has “a level of commitment … which I don’t think we can psychically meet,” absent huge changes in how the government finances itself. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated that deficit spending by the federal government has not been as effective at stimulating the economy as expected.

The family lived in the Washington region, Miami and Connecticut prior to Libby's graduation from Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1968. He and his elder brother, Hank, a retired tax lawyer, were the first in the family to graduate from college. Libby matriculated at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in Fall 1968, graduating magna cum laude in 1972. As Yale Daily News reporter Jack Mirkinson observes, \\"Even though he would eventually become a prominent Republican, Libby's political beginnings would not have pointed in that direction. He served as vice president of the Yale College Democrats and later campaigned for Michael Dukakis when he was running for governor of Massachusetts.\\" According to Mirkinson: \\"Two particular Yale courses helped guide Libby's future endeavors. One of these was a creative writing course, which started Libby on a 20-year mission to complete a novel ... [later published as] The Apprentice ... [and] a political science class with professor and future Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. In an interview with author James Mann, Libby said Wolfowitz was one of his favorite professors, and their professional relationship did not end with the class.\\" Wolfowitz became a significant mentor in his later professional life. In 1975, as a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar, Libby received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Columbia Law School. Entity:","response":"The entity this text is about is I.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no A step-by-step solution is:","response":"It is not possible to tell. A step-by-step solution is: 1. The first statement describes a situation where \\"a woman in a red dress covers another woman's eyes.\\" It means that one woman is behind the other and covers her eyes, possibly as a surprise or playing a game. This first statement doesn't provide any information about their location on a block. 2. The second statement says, \\"The two women are at opposite ends of the block.\\" It refers to a spatial relationship between the two women, but this information is not present in the first statement. 3. Since the first statement does not provide any information about the women's location on a block, we cannot determine if they are at opposite ends based on the given information. Thus, the answer is \\"it is not possible to tell\\" whether the two women are at opposite ends of the block based on the information provided in the first statement."},{"question":"I heard that Tracy made new friends and fit in well with the group.

Second question: What is Hadoop? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"First question: What does a Hadoop engineer do? A Hadoop engineer, also known as a Big Data engineer or a Hadoop developer, is a professional who specializes in the development, design, implementation, and management of big data solutions using the Hadoop ecosystem. They possess expertise in handling massive amounts of structured and unstructured data and are responsible for transforming them into meaningful insights to benefit an organization. Some of the key responsibilities of a Hadoop engineer include: 1. Developing and designing big data solutions: Hadoop engineers are responsible for designing and building scalable and reliable big data infrastructure based on clients' requirements and business needs. 2. Data processing: Hadoop engineers create and execute algorithms to process large datasets, using tools like Hive, Pig, and MapReduce within the Hadoop ecosystem for efficient and fast data processing. 3. Data modeling: They are responsible for creating efficient and scalable data models optimized for storage and retrieval, considering the unique requirements of big data environments. 4. Data storage and management: Hadoop engineers manage data storage, dealing with distributed file systems like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or other storage solutions compatible with Hadoop. 5. Optimization and performance tuning: They work on improving the performance of the cluster, including optimizing resource allocation and monitoring the system to identify any bottlenecks or issues that need to be resolved. 6. Data security: Data engineers have to ensure the security and privacy of data processed within the Hadoop system by implementing data access controls, encryption, and other security measures. 7. Maintenance and support: Hadoop engineers are also responsible for maintaining the Hadoop infrastructure, ensuring its stability, troubleshooting issues, and providing support to other teams working with big data systems. Second question: What is Hadoop? Hadoop is an open-source software framework developed for large-scale distributed computing and is primarily used to handle and process big data. It is designed to manage high volumes of structured and unstructured data effectively, making it highly scalable and fault-tolerant. Hadoop was created by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella in 2006 and is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. Hadoop is composed of two main components: 1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): A distributed storage layer that provides high-speed access to gigabytes or terabytes of data distributed across multiple nodes, ensuring a high degree of fault tolerance and availability. 2. Hadoop MapReduce: A distributed processing framework that allows developers to create programs for parallel processing of large datasets. MapReduce works by breaking down data into smaller chunks called 'maps' and consolidating them into a 'reduce' function to generate useful insights from the data. In addition to these main components, the Hadoop ecosystem also comprises multiple complementary tools and technologies such as Hive, Pig, YARN, HBase, Sqoop, Oozie, Flume, and Spark, which help in data processing, storage, management, and integration. In conclusion, both questions are related but not the same. The first question focuses on the role and responsibilities of a Hadoop engineer, a professional who works with Hadoop and other big data technologies. The second question is more focused on the Hadoop framework itself and its various components used for big data processing and management."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, You are given an open-domain question that can be answered based on factual information.

Where might she be/ A. field B. street C. playground D. bearing E. gymnasium The best answer is","response":"E. gymnasium While Lucy could potentially be found playing handball in some of the other options, the best answer is E, the gymnasium, as it is specifically designed for such sports activities. Let's break down why the other options may not be as suitable: A. Field: While it is possible to find Lucy playing handball in a field, it is not the most ideal location. Fields are typically open areas without the required walls for handball, and the ground may be uneven, making it difficult for Lucy to play. Moreover, fields are more commonly associated with sports like soccer or baseball. B. Street: Streets are not designed for playing sports, especially handball. Streets typically have traffic, pedestrians, and obstacles, making it an unsafe and impractical environment for such activities. Handball requires a confined area with walls to bounce the ball off, which is not commonly found in streets. C. Playground: Playgrounds are meant for children and generally focus on play equipment like swings, slides, and seesaws. Although it might be possible to find a space in a playground suitable for playing handball, it is likely not the top choice for Lucy, considering the more suitable alternatives available. D. Bearing: This option seems unrelated and a bit confusing within the context of the question. A bearing is a mechanical component used to reduce friction between moving parts, and it has little to do with where Lucy might be playing handball. In conclusion, the gymnasium is the best answer because it offers a safe, enclosed environment designed for sports like handball. It provides clearly defined playing areas with walls for bouncing the ball and generally has proper flooring designed to absorb impact, reducing the risk of injury for players like Lucy. Furthermore, gymnasiums may also have additional facilities and trained staff to ensure a pleasant playing experience for all participants."},{"question":"What is the subject line for this email? Judge says Enron has to give up documents By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau (Published Sept. 7, 2001) Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive internal documents to state legislators, a Sacramento judge ruled Thursday, but only after the two sides agree to a court-approved confidentiality agreement. For months, a special Senate committee investigating electricity price manipulation has been issuing subpoenas and gathering documents from power generators and marketers. During the process, the committee has found three companies in contempt for resisting the subpoenas, including Enron, which fought back with a lawsuit asking the court to intervene on its behalf. In his ruling stemming from the suit, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said he wasn't convinced that \\"the Senate committee will be able to maintain the petitioner's right to confidentiality.\\" As a result, he ruled, those documents handed over by Enron that contain legitimate trade secrets must be protected by a confidentiality agreement. In his ruling on another Enron motion, however, he denied the company's request to quash the committee's subpoena. Still, Enron officials considered the judge's findings on the whole a victory. \\"We had no certainty that anything we handed over to the Senate would remain confidential,\\" said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. \\"We were not receiving due process from Senator (Joe) Dunn's committee. They were acting as judge and jury on this issue.\\" Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who is the committee chairman, said he \\"respectfully disagrees\\" with the judge's decision on the confidentiality agreement, which he said will be reviewed in the next few days by the Legislature's lawyers to determine whether an appeal should be pursued. Another Enron motion seeking an injunction against the committee will be heard in court next week. Enron is one of three companies that have been found in contempt by the committee. However, the committee purged its contempt finding against Mirant in July after the company complied with the committee's requests. The committee was poised to expunge its contempt finding against Reliant Energy Inc. on Thursday as well but couldn't draw enough senators for a vote. Dunn delayed the action until the next meeting. As for the contempt charge facing Enron, the Senate Rules Committee is scheduled to review the findings Monday and possibly make a recommendation to the full Senate. Should the full Senate also find Enron in contempt, it would determine what punishments, if any, would be levied. Dunn said he believes fines would be the most appropriate punishment.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"We can see stars at day\\" - Sentence B: \\"We can see stars at night\\" Reason slowly and give your answer.","response":"Sentence A: \\"We can see stars at day\\" does not make sense. The reason for this is that, during the day, the sunlight is much brighter than the light emitted by the stars. The Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight, causing the sky to appear bright and blue, which effectively overwhelms the comparatively dim light coming from the stars. As a result, we cannot see stars during daytime, as their light is outshined by the sun's illumination of our atmosphere. In contrast, at night, the sun is no longer visible from the observer's standpoint, as the Earth's rotation has positioned the observer on the side of the planet facing away from the sun. This allows the stars' light to be more easily seen, as the brightness of the sky is significantly reduced without direct sunlight. Thus, Sentence B: \\"We can see stars at night\\" makes sense."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Polish. Your job is to translate the Polish sentence into English.

Throughout our lives, our brains maintain the capacity to acquire new skills, knowledge, and abilities. This is due to the concept of neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to adapt and create new neural connections throughout our lifetime. Moreover, in many cases, learning new skills and hobbies can be beneficial for people of all ages. For children and teenagers, learning new skills helps with their cognitive development and prepares them for various challenges in life. For adults, engaging in new and intellectually stimulating activities can improve cognitive function, mitigate age-related cognitive decline, and contribute to a more fulfilling life. For older adults, acquiring new skills has been shown to enhance cognitive resilience and overall mental well-being. In each of these cases, learning a new skill or hobby can have positive effects on the individual's life, personal growth and, in some instances, extend to the broader community. It serves as a reminder that it is never too late to challenge oneself and learn something new."},{"question":"THIS IS BY FAR MY MOST FAVOURITE MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!!!!

You’ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you’ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well. Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid. Each knot should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from each other. Make sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids. When you’ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you’ll complete the ‘loop’ by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you’ve sewn around the part, you should have a large ‘U’ shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid. The finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you’ve been sewing the whole time. Cut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot.","response":"To summarize, in order to create a weave, gather the necessary supplies, which include at least two packages of human hair wefts, curved sewing needles, matching weave thread, a wig cap, a pick or fine-tooth comb, and shears. Begin by attaching the wig cap to your perimeter braid, approximately 1-inch from the first knot. Use the curved sewing needle and weave thread to create knots evenly spaced around the perimeter braid, ensuring each knot is about 1 inch apart and tight enough to hold the cap firmly. Once the wig cap is securely attached to the perimeter braid, start sewing around the outline of your hair part using the same knot-tying method as before. Move up to the next row of braids, creating a 'U' shape of knots. Ensure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Complete the process by tying two finishing knots at the base of your sewing, where you began on the perimeter braid, and trim the extra string close to the knot without cutting it.

Richard Craig Smith told the AP on Friday night that the NFL has not provided documents and witnesses requested by the NFLPA's investigators, while the Ravens have refused any cooperation with similar requests. ''I am interested in the facts, and if we get cooperation from all the parties that were involved, we will have an understanding of what happened,'' Smith said. ''We cannot accept public statements that call for transparency, candor and openness and then not allow the investigators to do their jobs.'' The union's investigation, like a similar probe organized by the NFL, isn't a law enforcement inquiry and the parties involved aren't under any legal obligation to comply with requests. The league and the union, however, have each said separately that they wanted answers in the case. A spokesman for the NFL couldn't comment immediately when reached Friday night while a spokesman for the Ravens didn't immediately return a phone message. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely Sept. 8 for violating the league's personal conduct policy, once video of Rice hitting his then-fiancee was released publicly. The players' union hired Smith, a former federal prosecutor, one month ago to oversee its investigation into how the Ravens and the league handled themselves during the events that led to the suspension, as well as how the team handled issues like due process. Separately, the NFL hired former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III to conduct a probe into how the league handled evidence as it investigated the claims against Rice. NFL owners plan to make the findings of Mueller's report public. Smith said the union's investigation is important to ensuring the process was fair, and that requires transparency. ''If the NFL is genuinely concerned about fixing the issues that led to an admitted mistake, then they should be honest and forthright about what they knew and when they knew it,'' Smith said. ''We want both our team and Bob Mueller's team each to be able to conduct a thorough review of all the relevant facts.'' Smith, the head of regulatory and governmental investigation for the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, represented the union during the Saints bounty scandal that resulted in four players being reinstated from suspension through an appeal in 2012. Goodell originally suspended Rice for two games. Once the video became public, the Ravens cut Rice, and the league banned him indefinitely. The league considered the video to be new evidence, giving Goodell the authority to further suspend Rice. The players' union appealed Rice's suspension, saying he should not be punished twice. Former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones was selected by the commissioner and the players' union to hear the appeal. A person familiar with the case told the AP that Judge Jones told Goodell on Wednesday that he should testify at the hearing, which will be held Nov. 5-6. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because details haven't been made public, said Adolpho Birch, the NFL's vice president for labor policy, league attorney Kevin Manara and security chief Jeffery Miller also are expected to testify along with Ravens President Dick Cass and general manager Ozzie Newsome. Rice plans to testify and his wife, Janay, might testify, the person said.

Context: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army.

Alice's name, being a proper noun, should be capitalized. My steps are as follows: Step 1: Capitalize the first word of the sentence, which is 'alice'. It should be capitalized because every sentence starts with a capital letter according to English grammar. So 'alice' becomes 'Alice'. Step 2: Scan through the sentence to identify other proper nouns that should be capitalized. 'Queen' should be capitalized as it is referring a specific person, a title, in this context. So, 'queen' becomes 'Queen'. However, 'little lily' is not being used as a proper noun here. Without additional context indicating that 'little lily' is a name or title, we should not automatically capitalize it.

This concept is not written into the Constitution, but was envisioned by many of the Constitution's Framers (for example, The Federalist Papers mention it). The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in Marbury v. Madison. There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency, but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves. For this reason, precedent alone established the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional. Q: What is the court case that established judicial review?","response":"The court case that established judicial review is Marbury v. Madison. This landmark case occurred in 1803 and was a decision made by the United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall. Through this decision, the Supreme Court asserted its authority to review and determine the constitutionality of acts passed by Congress and actions taken by the executive branch. Marbury v. Madison thus established the crucial principle of judicial review, strengthening the role of the judiciary and its ability to serve as a check on the other branches of government in the United States."},{"question":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The first summer job is often a signal that you are on your way to adulthood, and it is also a method for earning money to pay for what you dream of.

Born on March 12, 1948, Taylor has had a significant impact on the world of music since the late 1960s and is considered one of the best-selling music artists of all time. James Taylor wrote \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" in 1968, and it was featured on his debut album titled \\"James Taylor,\\" which was released that same year. The song was recorded in London during his short-lived contract with Apple Records, which was the record label founded by The Beatles. The album, however, didn't receive much attention upon its release, and it was not until his subsequent albums, like \\"Sweet Baby James\\" released in 1970, which established him as a prominent artist. \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" showcases Taylor's exceptional songwriting skills and has been praised for its evocative lyrics and melodic structure. The song reflects his signature style that blends elements of folk, pop, and rock music. It also talks about the feelings of attraction, love, and devotion, making it a timeless piece. Over the years, the precise background story to the lyrics of \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" has been a subject of debate. However, it is widely believed that the song was inspired by his romantic relationships and his experiences with women. The beautiful imagery and poetic profundity of the song have not only contributed to its enduring appeal but also solidified James Taylor's status as a masterful songwriter."},{"question":"Tom cannot afford a normal doctor, so he goes to a discount clinic that is 70% cheaper. It takes two visits, though, instead of 1. A normal doctor charges 200 for a visit. How much money does he save? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To calculate Tom's savings, let's first figure out the cost of the discount clinic per visit and then multiply it by the number of visits he needs. Finally, we'll compare the total cost of the discount clinic to the cost of a normal doctor's visit. 1. Calculate the cost of the discount clinic per visit: Normal doctor's visit cost: 200 Discount offered by the clinic: 70% of 200 Discount clinic's visit cost = 200 - (0.7 * 200) 2. Calculate the total cost of the discount clinic for the required visits: Since Tom needs two visits at the discount clinic: Total cost = Discount clinic's visit cost * 2 3. Calculate Tom's savings: Tom's savings = Cost of normal doctor - Total cost of discount clinic Using the above method, let's now calculate the cost and savings: 1. Calculate the cost of the discount clinic per visit: Normal doctor's visit cost: 200 Discount offered by the clinic: 70% of 200 = 0.7 * 200 = 140 Discount clinic's visit cost = 200 - 140 = 60 2. Calculate the total cost of the discount clinic for the required visits: Since Tom needs two visits at the discount clinic: Total cost = Discount clinic's visit cost * 2 = 60 * 2 = 120 3. Calculate Tom's savings: Tom's savings = Cost of normal doctor - Total cost of discount clinic = 200 - 120 = 80 So, Tom saves 80 by going to the discount clinic instead of visiting a normal doctor. The reasons for the savings are the significantly reduced cost of the discount clinic services (70% cheaper) and the need for Tom to visit twice instead of just once."},{"question":"Here is a dialogue: Jack: Look at the woman next to me :P Jill: what?

Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Ellis, son of Edward Peppen Ellis and Susannah Mary Wheatley, was born in Croydon, Surrey (now part of Greater London). He had four sisters, none of whom married. His father was a sea captain, his mother the daughter of a sea captain, and many other relatives lived on or near the sea. When he was seven his father took him on one of his voyages, during which they called at Sydney, Callao and Antwerp. After his return, Ellis attended the French and German College near Wimbledon, and afterward attended a school in Mitcham. In April 1875, Ellis sailed on his father's ship for Australia; soon after his arrival in Sydney, he obtained a position as a master at a private school. After the discovery of his lack of training, he was fired and became a tutor for a family living a few miles from Carcoar. He spent a year there and then obtained a position as a master at a grammar school in Grafton. The headmaster had died and Ellis carried on the school for that year, but was unsuccessful. At the end of the year, he returned to Sydney and, after three months' training, was given charge of two government part-time elementary schools, one at Sparkes Creek, near Scone, New South Wales and the other at Junction Creek. He lived at the school house on Sparkes Creek for a year. He wrote in his autobiography, \\"In Australia, I gained health of body, I attained peace of soul, my life task was revealed to me, I was able to decide on a professional vocation, I became an artist in literature these five points covered the whole activity of my life in the world. Some of them I should doubtless have reached without the aid of the Australian environment, scarcely all, and most of them I could never have achieved so completely if chance had not cast me into the solitude of the Liverpool Range.\\" Entity:","response":"The entity this text is about is Henry Havelock Ellis, also known as Havelock Ellis, an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual, and social reformer who studied human sexuality."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - Coagulopathy ( also called a clotting disorder ) is a condition in which the blood 's ability to coagulate ( form clots ) is impaired . This condition can cause a tendency toward prolonged or excessive bleeding ( bleeding diathesis or bleeding disorder ) , which may occur spontaneously or following an injury or medical and dental procedures . - In medicine (hematology), bleeding diathesis (h(a)emorrhagic diathesis) is an unusual susceptibility to bleed (hemorrhage) mostly due to hypocoagulability, in turn caused by a coagulopathy (a defect in the system of coagulation). Several types are distinguished, ranging from mild to lethal. Also, bleeding diathesis can be caused by thinning of the skin or impaired wound healing. - Hematology, also spelled haematology (from the Greek , \\"haima\\" \\"blood,\\" and -o), is the branch of medicine concerned with the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. Hematology includes the study of etiology. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots, other bleeding disorders and blood cancers such as leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. Many hematologists work as hematologist-oncologists, also providing medical treatment for all types of cancer. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.

Question 2: Can I crack the IES exam in my final year of BE or do I have to try it after completing my BE? Is it a good choice to join Made Easy in Pune or is a Delhi branch a must for it? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are related but address different aspects of preparing for competitive examinations, specifically concerning the Made Easy coaching institute. Question 1 asks about the best Made Easy branch for Civil Engineering (CE) after the Delhi branch. This question focuses on the recommended branch for Civil Engineering students, not taking into account their educational stage or other preferences. Question 2 is a two-part question. The first part asks if it is possible to crack the IES (Indian Engineering Services) exam during the final year of the Bachelor of Engineering (BE) program, or if it is necessary to attempt it after completing the degree. The second part inquires whether joining the Made Easy branch in Pune is a sufficient choice, or if attending the Delhi branch is mandatory for better preparation. This question considers the exam's timing and the optimal branch for success in the IES exam. To provide a detailed answer to both questions: For Question 1, the best Made Easy branch other than Delhi for Civil Engineering students would be the one that has a strong faculty team, good infrastructure and resources, and a proven track record of successful students. Various factors, such as location, cost, and individual preferences, can influence this choice. Each student may have a different priority when selecting the best fit for them. Performing thorough research, attending open houses, and speaking with former students can help you determine which branch suits your needs. For Question 2, it is possible to crack the IES exam in your final year of BE, granted that you are fulfilling the eligibility criteria defined by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). However, keep in mind that it requires extensive preparation, dedication, and time management. Balancing your coursework and IES exam preparation simultaneously might be challenging. You may consider attempting the exam after completing your degree if you feel the need to focus solely on your IES preparation.

He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.

They are examining the effects of different types of music on the growth rate of various plants. Hypothesis: Playing classical music to plants will lead to increased growth rates in comparison to plants exposed to other types of music or no music at all. Step 1: Determine the research question. Researchers want to understand if the type of music affects the growth rate of plants, with a focus on classical music being potentially beneficial. This is the foundation of the hypothesis. Step 2: Investigate the field. The researchers examine current literature and findings on how sound affects plant growth and if there's any evidence of particular genres having an impact. This background research helps in refining the hypothesis. Step 3: Establish a hypothesis. Based on the existing evidence, the researchers hypothesize that classical music will have a positive effect on plant growth compared to other music genres or no music. Step 4: Set up the experiment. The researchers will need to design an experiment to test their hypothesis. This will involve selecting different types of plants and exposing them to various genres of music, including classical, rock, and pop, as well as a control group with no music. Step 5: Control variables. To ensure a fair test, researchers must control external factors, such as the amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients each plant receives, so that the only variable in the experiment is the type of music being played. Step 6: Measure the results. The researchers will measure the growth rate of the plants exposed to different types of music over a specific period. Then, they will analyze and compare the results to see if there is a statistically significant difference in the growth rates of the plants that listened to classical music versus other genres or no music. Step 7: Interpret and validate the hypothesis. If the results show that the plants exposed to classical music grew faster than the other groups, the researchers will likely conclude that their hypothesis is supported. However, it's crucial to replicate the experiment and gather more data to validate the hypothesis conclusively."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: Akita, Akita IS_PART_OF Akita Prefecture; Japan ETHNIC_GROUP Brazilians in Japan; Japan LEADER_NAME Tarō Asō; Akita, Akita COUNTRY Japan; Akita Museum of Art LOCATION Akita, Akita Sentence:","response":"The city of Akita, situated in the culturally rich Akita Prefecture of Japan, not only boasts a diverse population with a notable presence of Brazilians forming a significant ethnic group, but also prides itself on its vibrant and esteemed Akita Museum of Art, all under the deft leadership of the highly respected Tarō Asō, making Akita, Akita an invaluable and fascinating region of the great country of Japan."},{"question":"Question: Water density increases as salinity and pressure increase, or as temperature decreases.

In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - In statistics , a generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a generalized linear model in which the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables , and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions . GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models . The model relates a univariate response variable , Y , to some predictor variables , xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y ( for example normal , binomial or Poisson distributions ) along with a link function g ( for example the identity or log functions ) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as g ( operatorname ( E ) ( Y ) ) = beta_0 + f_1 ( x_1 ) + f_2 ( x_2 ) + cdots + f_m ( x_m ) . , ! The functions fi ( xi ) may be functions with a specified parametric form ( for example a polynomial , or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable ) or may be specified non-parametrically , or semi-parametrically , simply as ' smooth functions ' , to be estimated by non-parametric means . So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function , such as a locally weighted mean , for f1 ( x1 ) , and then use a factor model for f2 ( x2 ) . This flexibility to allow non-parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor , provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models , but arguably with some loss of interpretability . - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population. - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process. - In statistics, multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. - The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization. - Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates. - Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice. - A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data. - In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a \\"model\\" to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data. In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data. - In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981) and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The \\"AM\\" uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a \\"p\\"-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the \\"AM\\" is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with \\"AM\\" include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity. - In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a \\"link function\\" and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.

The answer to this question is:","response":"The last step of the breathing process after exhaling carbon dioxide is inhaling again to repeat the cycle. This continuous cycle of inhaling and exhaling allows our body to maintain a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, ensuring that our cells receive the oxygen they need for energy production and that waste products, like carbon dioxide, are removed from the body. This entire process is referred to as respiration, which is vital for sustaining life."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Viacom, Inc.

Question: what has alcohol that you normally use on the tips of your finger for color removal Context: In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism. Answer:","response":"In the given context, there is no mention of a substance specifically used on the tips of fingers for color removal. However, it does mention that some Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes like nail polish and rubbing alcohol.
