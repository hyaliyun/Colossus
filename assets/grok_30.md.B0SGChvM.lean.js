It was cleaned every day, but it was always full of water and pee by morning. Where is the bathroom located? Options: - school - at hotel - neighbor's house - college - flat Explain why a human would choose \\"school\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"school\\" as the answer to the question above for several reasons. While all of the options listed could potentially have a dirty and messy bathroom, a school is more likely to have such issues due to a few contributing factors. 1. High foot traffic: School bathrooms experience a large number of users every day, as students, teachers, and staff all use these facilities. This high volume of foot traffic increases the likelihood of water and pee accumulating on a daily basis despite regular cleaning. 2. Young users: A significant portion of the individuals using school bathrooms may be young children or teenagers. These younger users might not have the same level of personal hygiene and cleanliness habits as adults, leading to a greater potential for messiness in the bathroom. 3. Limited supervision: In a school setting, bathrooms tend to have limited direct supervision. This lack of oversight can lead to some users not taking responsibility for their actions, resulting in a messier bathroom environment. 4. Vandalism and pranks: School bathrooms can unfortunately be a common site for vandalism and prank activities, further contributing to their uncleanliness. These occurrences can make it difficult to maintain a clean and hygienic environment, even with daily cleaning. 5. Insufficient resources: Schools can sometimes face budget constraints, leading to inadequate resources for maintaining clean bathrooms. Limited staff or cleaning supplies can make it challenging to keep up with the high demand for cleaning services in these facilities. In contrast, a hotel, neighbor's house, college, or flat may have different dynamics that make it less likely for a bathroom to remain dirty and messy despite daily cleaning. For example, a hotel might have a dedicated housekeeping team that ensures cleanliness, while an individual's house or flat would have fewer users and therefore, less possibility for messiness. A college bathroom might experience similar issues as a school, but it can be argued that adult users at a college may have a higher level of personal responsibility and maturity, potentially resulting in less accumulation of water and pee on a daily basis. In summary, a human would choose \\"school\\" as the answer to the question based on the likelihood of a school bathroom experiencing high foot traffic, having younger users, experiencing limited supervision, being subjected to vandalism or pranks, and potentially facing insufficient resources for maintenance. These factors make school bathrooms more prone to being dirty and messy despite daily cleaning efforts."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \\"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\\" The track \\"Most of the Time\\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \\"What Was It You Wanted?\\" has been interpreted both as a... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that played Billy Parker?

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

It was released on October 14, 2016, by RCA Records. The album title is an acronym for \\"We Are Like Love Songs\\", which continues the band's unwritten rule of having five-syllable album titles. Can we infer the following? Walls is apparently written after one of the band members had broken up with his girlfriend.","response":"Walls, the seventh studio album by Kings of Leon, marked a slight shift in the band's sound and approach to their music, offering more introspective lyrics and emotional themes. It is possible to infer that the inspiration for the album, or at least some of its songs, may have been related to personal experiences of the band members, including breakups and relationship struggles. The album title, \\"We Are Like Love Songs\\" (WALLS), hints at the strong emotional undertones present in the music. While there is no direct evidence pointing to the fact that the album was written explicitly after a band member's breakup, it is plausible that a romantic relationship could have served as one of the main inspirations for the lyrics and themes explored in the album. Throughout WALLS, Kings of Leon delve into heartfelt matters, vulnerability, and growth in relationships. For example, songs like \\"Waste a Moment,\\" \\"Find Me,\\" and \\"Over\\" bear the emotional weight of love, longing, and pain, which could be interpreted as reflections on past relationships or life experiences of the band members. It is important to note that songwriting is a personal and often cathartic process for many artists. Lyrics can act as an outlet for unresolved emotions or serve as reflections on an artist's life. While it may be tempting to connect the dots between a band member's personal life and the overarching theme of an album, it is crucial to remember that musicians use creative license and imagination to craft their narratives. Consequently, making an indisputable connection between the creation of WALLS and a specific breakup remains speculative. In conclusion, while it is possible that the inspiration behind WALLS stemmed from a band member's breakup or relationship struggles, it is important to recognize that musical inspiration can stem from a myriad of experiences. The album's emotional depth and exploration of different themes could indeed be a result of personal events in the lives of the band members, but there is no concrete evidence to explicitly support the claim that a specific breakup led to the album's creation."},{"question":"What key details about jimmy wang -lrb- actor -rrb- can be extracted from the following bio?

Monitor pollen counts. Remove wet leaves from your yard. Avoid ragweed. Article:","response":"Title: Combating Seasonal Allergies: Practical Tips for Relief Introduction Seasonal allergies, also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, affect millions of people every year. They are caused by an overreaction of the immune system to pollen and other allergens found in the environment. For many, this overreaction can result in sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and a runny or stuffy nose. While there is no permanent cure for seasonal allergies, several strategies can be implemented to help manage the symptoms and make life more comfortable for those who suffer from them. In this article, we will discuss the importance of wearing a mask, monitoring pollen counts, removing wet leaves from your yard, and avoiding ragweed as effective ways to combat seasonal allergies. 1. Wear a Mask Wearing a mask, especially during peak allergy season, can be an effective way to reduce the inhalation of pollen and other allergens that cause seasonal allergies. Masks can filter out large particles, such as pollen, dust, and mold spores, which can significantly reduce the amount of allergens entering your respiratory system. When choosing a mask, opt for one that is specifically designed for allergy protection. These masks usually have a higher filtration efficiency and are made of materials that are designed to prevent allergens from entering your nose and mouth. Make sure the mask fits snugly around your face, and change it regularly to maintain its effectiveness. 2. Monitor Pollen Counts Keeping an eye on pollen counts in your area can help you anticipate when your allergy symptoms may be worse and take appropriate preventive measures. Pollen counts are typically highest between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m., and on warm, dry, and windy days. You can check your local pollen count through several sources, including the National Allergy Bureau, local news broadcasts, or various mobile apps available for your smartphone. When pollen counts are high, try to stay indoors as much as possible, avoid outdoor activities during peak times, and close your windows and doors to prevent allergens from entering your home. 3. Remove Wet Leaves from Your Yard Wet, damp leaves can be a breeding ground for mold spores, which can cause allergy symptoms in some individuals. It is important to be proactive in removing wet leaves from your yard, especially during the fall season when leaves are more likely to accumulate and create damp conditions. Regularly raking and disposing of leaves can help to reduce the amount of mold spores present in your yard and minimize your exposure to this allergen. In addition, removing wet leaves can also improve the overall appearance and cleanliness of your property. 4. Avoid Ragweed Ragweed is one of the most common causes of seasonal allergies, and its pollen is responsible for triggering allergic reactions in many individuals. To minimize your exposure to ragweed pollen, make an effort to identify and remove any ragweed plants growing in your yard or garden. Ragweed has a distinct appearance, with green, feathery leaves and small green or white flowers. You can also implement strategies to help prevent ragweed from growing in your yard, such as planting a barrier of native, allergy-friendly plants around your property. Conclusion Seasonal allergies can be frustrating and uncomfortable, but by implementing these strategies, you can help to minimize your exposure to allergens and reduce the severity of your symptoms. Wearing a mask, monitoring pollen counts, removing wet leaves from your yard, and avoiding ragweed can all contribute to a more comfortable allergy season. In addition to these practical tips, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and explore additional treatment options that can help you manage your seasonal allergies effectively. Remember, the key to combating seasonal allergies is to be proactive and take control of your environment to create a healthier, happier, and more allergy-free lifestyle."},{"question":"Question 1: Why am I unable to make calls from my Jio sim from motto g 3?

There are several different approaches to setting weight loss goals, but let's discuss two specific solutions and determine which may be the better option: Solution 1: Setting a Specific Weight Loss Goal In this approach, you set a specific amount of weight you want to lose within the one-month period. To do this, consider the following steps: 1. Determine your current weight: Start by measuring your current weight to establish a baseline. Use a reliable and accurate scale for consistency. 2. Calculate a realistic goal: A healthy rate of weight loss is typically considered to be 1-2 pounds per week. Over a one-month period, losing 4-8 pounds is a reasonable and achievable target. This, however, may vary depending on factors such as age, gender, metabolism, and physical activity levels. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before setting a specific weight loss goal. 3. Develop a diet plan: Consult a nutritionist or use online resources to create a balanced diet plan, focusing on cutting unnecessary calories and incorporating nutrient-dense, whole foods. Track your daily caloric intake and make adjustments as needed. 4. Incorporate regular exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with strength training sessions. Choose exercises that you enjoy to make the routine more sustainable. 5. Monitor progress: Weigh yourself weekly, using the same scale and techniques to ensure consistency. Celebrate your progress but avoid getting discouraged by temporary setbacks. 6. Stay motivated: Seek support from friends, family, or online groups, and maintain accountability by keeping a diary or using a fitness app. Regularly remind yourself of your goal and visualize the benefits of achieving it. Solution 2: Focus on Behavioral Goals Instead of setting a specific weight loss number as your primary goal, you can set behavioral goals that promote a healthy lifestyle. This approach focuses on building sustainable habits that contribute to long-term weight management. Some behavioral goals could include: 1. Increasing daily physical activity: A goal of taking 10,000 steps per day or engaging in at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily can help integrate exercise into your routine. 2. Drinking more water: Aim for at least 8 cups of water per day to stay hydrated and potentially reduce feelings of hunger. 3. Cooking at home: Homemade meals can be more nutritious and lower in calories than restaurant or takeout meals. Set a goal of cooking a certain number of meals at home per week. 4. Eating mindfully: Practice mindful eating by slowing down, listening to your body's signals, and focusing on the experience of eating. 5. Developing a regular sleep pattern: Sleep can play a role in weight management, so aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night and establish a regular sleep schedule. 6. Reducing stress: Manage stress through mindfulness meditation, yoga, hobbies, or other activities that you find soothing and relaxing. When comparing these two solutions, it is important to consider your personal preferences, motivations, and habits. Solution 1 offers a more focused target by using a specific weight loss goal, which can be motivating and provide a clear measure of success. However, this approach can sometimes result in feelings of disappointment if the target is not met. Solution 2, on the other hand, promotes long-term lifestyle changes and shifts the focus from weight loss alone to overall well-being. This approach can lead to sustainable habits and potentially result in weight loss over time, without the pressure of reaching a specific number within a short timeframe. This can also increase the chances of maintaining weight loss over the long term. In conclusion, while both solutions have their merits, Solution 2 (focusing on behavioral goals) may be a better overall approach for setting weight loss goals in a one-month period. This method shifts the focus to sustainable lifestyle changes and overall well-being, leading to healthier habits that can last beyond the one-month period.

Choices: - glycolysis - respiration - chemosynthesis - photosynthesis A: Answer:","response":"The process by which plants gain energy and produce sugar is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a complex process that takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, primarily in the leaves. During photosynthesis, plants capture sunlight using chlorophyll pigments, which are responsible for the green color of plant leaves. The absorbed sunlight is then combined with water and carbon dioxide from the environment to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The process of photosynthesis can be represented by the following equation: 6CO2 + 12H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O Here, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are converted into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) using light energy from the sun. Photosynthesis is a vital process for life on Earth, as it not only sustains plant life but is also the primary source of oxygen for organisms and helps maintain the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, plants serve as a food source for many different organisms, including humans, which consume plants directly or indirectly, by consuming other organisms that rely on plants for their energy needs."},{"question":"wildflowers and plants photos flowers pictures | wildflowers pictures | spring flowers pictures Please write the text above using proper case.","response":"Wildflowers and Plants Photos Flowers Pictures | Wildflowers Pictures | Spring Flowers Pictures Step 1: Identify the words and phrases that need capitalization.

In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).

Answer:","response":"New York is located in the Eastern Time Zone (ET) of the United States, which is also abbreviated as EST (Eastern Standard Time) during the standard time and EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) during the daylight saving time. The Eastern Time Zone covers a large portion of the United States' eastern seaboard, including not only the state of New York, but also other densely populated states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Florida, as well as parts of eastern Canada. The time zone is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), commonly known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Eastern Standard Time is UTC-5, meaning it is five hours behind Coordinated Universal Time. During daylight saving time, the clock is advanced by one hour, resulting in Eastern Daylight Time being UTC-4. Daylight saving time in the United States usually begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. During this period, the clocks are advanced by one hour to take advantage of the increased daylight hours in the evening. This practice facilitates energy conservation by reducing the need for artificial lighting and heating during those hours. To conclude, New York follows the Eastern Time Zone, which is split into Eastern Standard Time (EST) when observing standard time and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) when observing daylight saving time. The time difference between New York and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is either minus five hours (UTC-5) during standard time or minus four hours (UTC-4) during daylight saving time."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

What is this text about?","response":"This text is about an incident in which a tunnel, intended to be used for smuggling materials from Egypt into Gaza, collapsed and resulted in the death of at least five individuals. Additionally, there were three people unaccounted for after this tragic event. The tunnel was being constructed by Palestinians to facilitate the illegal transport of goods across the border, possibly due to restrictions imposed on the movement of goods and people in the region. Gaza, a Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, is governed by the Hamas faction and has been under strict blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2007. The blockade was implemented due to security concerns, with both countries trying to prevent the smuggling of weapons and other materials that could be used for combat and to carry out attacks. The smugglers' tunnels are a result of the limited accessibility to essential resources for many Palestinians living in Gaza. They seek to create underground routes to bypass the blockade and gain access to supplies that are not easily available within the territory. These tunnels have been a lifeline for the residents of Gaza but are also dangerous due to their clandestine nature, making them more susceptible to collapses and causing incidents like the one described in the text. Smuggling tunnels are not only used for transporting essential goods but also for illegal activities such as arms trafficking and other criminal endeavors. Due to their secretive nature, they are often poorly constructed, which increases the risk of accidents. Despite efforts by both Israel and Egypt to destroy these tunnels, many continue to be built and remain in operation. In conclusion, the text is describing a tragic accident that occurred during the construction of a smuggling tunnel between Egypt and Gaza, which resulted in the death of at least five people and left three others missing. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges and dangerous conditions faced by Palestinians who attempt to bypass the blockade in search of essential resources, as well as the security concerns that persist in the region due to the illegal activities facilitated by these tunnels."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A man is standing in the sand with his shoes in one hand and holding a camera to his face with the other hand.\\" that \\"The man is standing in the windy city during freezing cold temperatures.\\"?

Proper case is essential in various aspects of writing, as it helps convey the intended meaning and context, while also making the written text aesthetically pleasing and easily understandable. Here are some important areas where the use of proper case matters: 1. Capitalization of the first word in a sentence: The first word in a sentence should always begin with a capital letter, as it signals the start of a new thought or idea. For example, \\"The cat is on the roof.\\" 2. Proper nouns: Proper nouns, which refer to specific names of people, places, or things, should always be capitalized, such as John, Paris, or the Statue of Liberty. This helps distinguish proper nouns from common nouns, which are general terms for people, items, or places, and are not capitalized unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence or within titles. 3. Titles and headings: Titles of books, articles, poems, movies, songs, and other creative works should be written in title case, meaning that the first letter of each significant word is capitalized. For example, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Additionally, headings and subheadings in documents should also be capitalized in the same manner to emphasize hierarchy and structure. 4. Personal pronouns: The pronoun 'I' is always capitalized in English, regardless of its position within a sentence. 5. Acronyms and initialisms: Acronyms (abbreviations formed from the first letter of each word in a phrase) and initialisms (abbreviations consisting of the initial letters of each word) are usually written in all uppercase letters, such as NASA or FBI. This helps differentiate them from regular words and emphasize their specialized meaning. 6. Days, months, and holidays: The names of days, months, and holidays are capitalized to highlight their significance, such as Monday, September, or Thanksgiving. Note that seasons (e.g., spring, summer, autumn/fall, winter) are not capitalized unless they appear in a title or as part of a proper noun. 7. Proper adjectives: Proper adjectives, which are derived from proper nouns, should also be capitalized. For example, \\"Italian cuisine\\" or \\"Shakespearean sonnet.\\" 8. Geographic locations: Names of countries, cities, continents, regions, and natural features (such as mountains, rivers, and oceans) should be capitalized, as they are proper nouns. For example, \\"Japan,\\" \\"New York City,\\" and \\"the Mississippi River.\\" In conclusion, the concept of proper case is essential in written communication, as it helps convey the intended meaning and context, while also making the text more visually appealing and comprehensible. Attention to proper case is a vital aspect of effective writing and demonstrates respect for the language and the reader."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: It was a first experience and a very successful one, because such complicated work has had excellent results.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \\"Celtic\\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \\"Celtic art\\" only from the La Tene period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the Picts is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts. The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including Iona, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south. After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced Pictish art, with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones. Pictish stones are assigned by scholars to 3 classes. Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the Pictish Beast, and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror). The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others. This is often taken to symbolise a woman. Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east Scotland from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. Good examples include the Dunnichen and Aberlemno stones (Angus), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones (Aberdeenshire). Class II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces. The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the Insular style. On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes. Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so. The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures. Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology. Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle (Perthshire), Aberlemno (Angus), Nigg, Shandwick and Hilton of Cadboll (Easter Ross). Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols. Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, Perthshire). These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century. Examples include the sarcophagus and the large collection of cross-slabs at St Andrews (Fife). The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle (Perthshire), St Vigeans (Angus) and St Andrew's Cathedral (Fife) (all Historic Scotland), the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, Forfar (Angus), Inverness Museum, Groam House Museum, Rosemarkie and Tarbat Discovery Centre, Portmahomack (both Easter Ross) and Tankerness House Museum, Kirkwall, Orkney. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What are the Picts?","response":"The Picts were an ancient people who inhabited modern Scotland during the 5th to the mid-9th centuries. Their art is primarily known through stone sculpture and a smaller number of metalwork pieces."},{"question":"When numbers of such rumors exist and are persistent, one suspects a “whispering campaign.” Make this lower case.","response":"\\"when numbers of such rumors exist and are persistent, one suspects a 'whispering campaign.'\\" A whispering campaign is a method of communication that involves spreading rumors and misinformation via word-of-mouth or other indirect means. By sharing unverified and often negative information about someone or something, a whispering campaign aims to negatively affect public opinion, trust, or credibility. While these types of campaigns can be used to target specific individuals or entities, they can also be employed to shape larger conversations or societal issues. Lowercase letters, as seen in the sentence provided, are used stylistically to emphasize a casual or informal tone. When applied to phrases or statements, this approach can create the impression of a more intimate, personal, or conversational undertaking. In the context of discussing a whispering campaign, employing lowercase letters might be representative of the secretive, underhanded nature of the subject matter. Whispering campaigns are often found in various environments, including educational settings, workplaces, and political spaces. The following are some common characteristics or objectives of a whispering campaign: 1. Gossip and rumor-spreading: A key facet of whispering campaigns involves the sharing of hearsay or unverified information. The individuals involved in propagating the rumors may do so deliberately to damage the target's reputation or disrupt their personal life. 2. Manipulation of information: To achieve the desired outcome, whispering campaigns may involve manipulating or twisting information to present the targeted subject in a negative light. 3. Conspiratorial intentions: The individuals involved in a whispering campaign might work in concert in order to bring fuel to the fire. By coordinating their efforts, they have a stronger chance of achieving their intended impact on public opinion. 4. Persistence: A significant characteristic of a whispering campaign is its persistence. These campaigns are not one-time instances of rumor-spreading; rather, they continue for extended periods, often intensifying in severity and reach. 5. Deniability: As whispering campaigns utilize word-of-mouth or other indirect means of communication, it is often difficult to pinpoint the original source of the rumors or assign responsibility for their spread. This enables the perpetrators to remain anonymous or avoid direct consequence for their actions. While whispering campaigns can be damaging and hurtful to those affected, there are steps individuals and organizations can take to address and mitigate the impact of such behavior. Strategies include promoting open communication among members, fostering a positive organizational culture, establishing appropriate reporting mechanisms, and providing education to create awareness of the consequences associated with participating in gossip or rumors. Additionally, adopting a critical and discerning approach to information can help individuals recognize the signs of a whispering campaign and exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims."},{"question":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered.

The reviewer clearly expresses dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the toy, highlighting its poor functionality and overall design. Some of the key issues mentioned in the review include: 1. Limited range: The toy only allows for the waterballs to travel a short distance of up to 10 feet, which is likely to be considered inadequate by users expecting better performance. 2. Small size of waterballs: The waterballs being the size of a quarter or even smaller adds to the disappointment, as it may not provide sufficient entertainment or impact as a water-based toy. 3. Uncomfortable design: The large, uncomfortable lever used to launch the waterballs appears to be poorly designed, making it difficult for the user to enjoy the toy. Additionally, the loud noise it generates when used adds to the negative experience. 4. Leakage issues: The user reports significant leakage problems arising from the two holes on the bottom of the launcher meant for securing the toy in its packaging. This design flaw not only causes water waste, but also discomfort as water leaks onto the user's clothes and surroundings. The recommendation to buy a Super Soaker instead further emphasizes the negative impression this reviewer has of the product and suggests that there are better alternatives available in the market.

Question 1 compares the effects of the Cambodia earthquake to the Banda Sea earthquake in 1938, while Question 2 compares the effects to the Iquique earthquake in 1877. Now, let's answer both questions in detail. Question 1: What were the major effects of the Cambodia earthquake, and how do these effects compare to the Banda Sea earthquake in 1938? To provide accurate information, it is necessary to pinpoint the specific earthquake in Cambodia being referred to. Cambodia is not usually known for significant earthquakes due to its geologically stable location. Nonetheless, here we'll discuss the effects of the strongest recent earthquake that occurred on April 19, 2021, measuring 3.5 magnitude. Major effects of the Cambodia Earthquake (April 2021): 1. The earthquake was felt in some parts of the country. 2. Buildings were shaken mildly, causing minimal damage. 3. No casualties were reported, and the effects were relatively minor due to the low magnitude of the earthquake. The Banda Sea Earthquake in 1938 occurred on February 1, 1938, in the Banda Sea region of Indonesia. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.4, making it one of the strongest earthquakes of the 20th century. Major effects of the Banda Sea Earthquake (1938): 1. Extensive damage to infrastructure, particularly on the island of Ambon due to a large tsunami. 2. Numerous casualties: around 200-500 people lost their lives, though estimates vary. 3. The earthquake generated a large tsunami with waves up to 2 meters high, causing further damage to coastal areas. Comparing the effects of the Cambodia earthquake to the Banda Sea earthquake, it is evident that the latter had far more severe consequences due to its higher magnitude. In comparison, the Cambodia earthquake resulted in minimal damage and no casualties. Question 2: What were the major effects of the Cambodia earthquake, and how do these effects compare to the Iquique earthquake in 1877? As previously discussed, the major effects of the Cambodia earthquake were minimal, with no casualties and only minor damage reported. The Iquique Earthquake in 1877 occurred on May 9, 1877, off the coast of Iquique, which was then part of Peru, and is now part of Chile. This earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 8.5–9.0 and caused significant destruction in the South American region. Major effects of the Iquique Earthquake (1877): 1. Widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure in the affected regions, particularly in the cities of Iquique and Arica. 2. A large number of casualties, with estimates varying from over 2,000 to as high as 5,000 fatalities. 3. The earthquake generated a massive tsunami that affected several coastal towns and cities along the Chilean and Peruvian coastlines. The tsunami also reached Hawaii, New Zealand, and Japan, causing additional destruction and casualties in those regions. Comparing the effects of the Cambodia earthquake to the Iquique Earthquake, once again, it is evident that the latter had far more devastating consequences driven by its significantly higher magnitude. In contrast, the low-magnitude Cambodia earthquake resulted in minimal damage and no reported casualties."},{"question":"Captain Alan G Poindexter was on a jet ski with son, 22, when his other son, 26, crashed into them. Given CPR on Pensacola Beach, Florida but later died in hospital. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Once upon a time in Pensacola Beach, Florida, a very brave man named Captain Alan G Poindexter organized a fun day on the beach for his two sons. One son was 22 years old and the other was 26 years old. Captain Alan was not just any man, he was an astronaut. Yes, he was one of the few people who could say that they had been to space! On this sunny day, they decided to play on jet skis- those are like motorbikes but on water, very fast and very fun. Captain Alan decided to share a jet ski with his younger son, they were just like a team having fun and making splashes in the water. Meanwhile, his elder son was on another jet ski, goofing around and enjoying the day. But something unfortunate happened, the older brother lost control of his jet ski and accidentally crashed into Captain Alan and his younger brother. Everyone at the beach quickly got really worried. Just like in the movies, some good people rushed over to help Captain Alan. They even did a special thing called CPR to help him breathe. CPR stands for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, it’s a way to help people breathe when they can’t do it themselves. It's like blowing air into a balloon, but instead, you are helping fill someone's lungs with air. Sadly, even after everything was done to save him, Captain Alan passed away in the hospital. It's like he went off to a long, peaceful sleep and didn't wake up. Everyone was really sad and missed him lot, especially his brave sons. But they also remembered the fun day at the beach and how their dad was always so brave and kind. And of course, they never forgot that their father was also a real-life spaceman! So, kids, remember to always cherish the time you spend with your family and make sure to always play safely when having fun.

But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \\"musette\\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés. Q: in 1880, how many dance halls were in Paris?","response":"In 1880, there were about 150 dance halls in Paris."},{"question":"The United States Army is made up of three components: the active component, the Regular Army; and two reserve components, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Both reserve components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month, known as battle assemblies or unit training assemblies (UTAs), and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. Both the Regular Army and the Army Reserve are organized under Title 10 of the United States Code, while the National Guard is organized under Title 32. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the U.S. Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state and territorial governors; the District of Columbia National Guard, however, reports to the U.S. President, not the district's mayor, even when not federalized. Any or all of the National Guard can be federalized by presidential order and against the governor's wishes. Who does the D.C. National Guard report to?","response":"The District of Columbia (D.C.) National Guard, unlike other National Guard units which report to their respective state or territorial governors, reports to the President of the United States. This structure is in place because the District of Columbia is not a state and does not have a governor. The D.C. National Guard is therefore a federal military force, and its relationship with the District of Columbia is unique among National Guard units. While the President is traditionally responsible for the defense of the entire U.S, the case of the D.C. National Guard highlights this role in a more direct way, as the President is essentially serving as the \\"governor\\" for the purposes of the D.C. National Guard. This arrangement means that even when not federalized (that is, given a strictly federal mission or placed under federal command), the D.C. National Guard is already under the authority of the federal government to a greater extent than other National Guard units. Therefore, both its peacetime and wartime roles differ somewhat from those of other National Guard units. It also means that the D.C National Guard can be mobilized more easily for federal missions, as there is no need to negotiate with a state governor for its use. Moreover, it operates under both Titles 10 and 32, the same as other National Guard units. However, it must be clearly stated that the command and control of D.C. National Guard not only revolves around the President but also involves the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army, who provide detailed regulations and instructions for the D.C. National Guard's operation and readiness. In conclusion, the D.C. National Guard reports to the President of the United States, reflecting the unique status of the District of Columbia within the U.S.'s political and military structures."},{"question":"if your pc opens the shu file, but it's the wrong application, you'll need to change your windows registry file association settings. in other words, windows is associating shu file extensions with the wrong software program.

It is a sensationalistic interpretation of the beatnik culture of the \\"Beat Generation\\" (and is sometimes considered one of the very last films noir to be produced.) The movie was also shown under the title \\"This Rebel Age\\". - In theatre, a monologue (from , from \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Spoken word is an oral art that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and intonation and voice inflection. It is a 'catchall' that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including hip-hop, jazz poetry, poetry slams, traditional poetry readings and can include comedy routines and 'prose monologues'. - A poetry slam is a competition at which poets read or recite original work. The performances are then judged by a panel typically of five judges, often selected from the audience, or sometimes judged by audience response. The judges usually give each poem a score on a scale of 010 (zero being the worst, ten being the best). The highest and lowest scores are dropped and the middle three are kept. The highest score one can receive is a 30 and the lowest is a zero. - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - The Beat Generation is a literary movement started by a group of authors whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post-World War II era. The bulk of their work was published and popularized throughout the 1950s. Central elements of Beat culture are rejection of standard narrative values, spiritual quest, exploration of American and Eastern religions, rejection of materialism, explicit portrayals of the human condition, experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and sexual liberation and exploration. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - In grammar, inflection or inflexion sometimes called accidence is the modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. The inflection of verbs is also called \\"conjugation\\", and one can refer to the inflection of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, participles, prepositions, postpositions, numerals, articles etc, as \\"declension\\". - William Seward Burroughs II ( / broz / ; also known by his pen name William Lee ; February 5 , 1914 -- August 2 , 1997 ) was an American novelist , short story writer , satirist , essayist , painter , and spoken word performer . A primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author who wrote in the paranoid fiction genre , he is considered to be \`\` one of the most politically trenchant , culturally influential , and innovative artists of the 20th century '' . His influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature . Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas , six collections of short stories and four collections of essays . Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences . He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians , and made many appearances in films . He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis , Missouri , grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation , William Seward Burroughs I , and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee . Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence , but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties . He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University , studied English , and anthropology as a postgraduate , and later attended medical school in Vienna . In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II , but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy , after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life , while working a variety of jobs . In 1943 while living in New York City , he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac , the mutually influential foundation of which grew into the Beat Generation , which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture . Much of Burroughs 's work is semi-autobiographical , primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict , as he lived throughout Mexico City , London , Paris and... - Jazz poetry is poetry that \\"demonstrates jazz-like rhythm or the feel of improvisation\\". The genre also includes poems written about jazz music, musicians, or the jazz milieu. During the 1920s, several poets began to eschew the conventions of rhythm and style; among these were Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and E. E. Cummings. The significance of the simultaneous evolution of poetry and jazz during the 1920s was apparent to many poets of the era, resulting in the merging of the two art forms into jazz poetry. Jazz poetry has long been something of an \\"outsider\\" art form that exists somewhere outside the mainstream, having been conceived in the 1920s by African Americans, maintained in the 1950s by counterculture poets like those of the Beat generation, and adapted in modern times into hip-hop music and live poetry events known as poetry slams. - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - A poetry reading is a public oral recitation or performance of poetry. - Paranoid fiction is a term sometimes used to describe works of literature that explores the subjective nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power. These forces can be external, such as a totalitarian government, or they can be internal, such as a character's mental illness or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). What is the relationship between 'william s. burroughs' and 'satire'? The answer to this question is:","response":"William S.

Passage: After another series of shogunate victories on the outskirts of Osaka, the Summer Campaign came to a head at the battle of Tennōji. Hideyori planned a hammer-and-anvil operation, in which 55,000 men would attack the center of the Eastern Army, while a second force, 16,500 men led by Kyōgoku Tadataka, Ishikawa Tadafusa, and Kyōgoku Takatomo, would flank them from the rear. Another contingent waited in reserve. Ieyasu's army was led by his son, the Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada, and numbered around 155,000. They moved in four parallel lines, prepared to make flanking maneuvers of their own. Mistakes on both sides nearly ruined the battle, as Hideyori's ronin split off from the main group, and Hidetada's reserve force moved up without orders from the main force. In the end, however, Hideyori's commander Sanada Yukimura was killed, destroying the morale of the Western Army. The smaller force led directly by Hideyori sallied forth from Osaka Castle too late, and was chased right back into the castle by the advancing enemies; there was no time to set up a proper defense of the castle, and it was soon ablaze and pummeled by artillery fire. Hideyori committed seppuku, and the final major uprising against Tokugawa rule was put to an end, leaving the shogunate unchallenged for approximately 250 years. According to an account by an employee of the Dutch East India Company in Hirado, several daimyō set the castle on fire and attempted to defect to Ieyasu. Hideyori executed them by throwing them off the castle wall but could not extinguish the fire, causing his suicide. The account also stated that about 10,000 people died. History indicates that the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi participated in the battle on the Toyotomi side, though he has no recorded accomplishments in this battle.","response":"Task: Create questions from the given passage that involve complex reasoning, including numerical reasoning, and require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer.

Steps: - Identify the number of people who died overall: 10,000 - Identify that Hideyori executed \\"several daimyō\\" but the exact number is not given - Since \\"several\\" usually means at least 3 in such context, we can assume that Hideyori executed at least 3 daimyō - Subtract the minimum number of executed daimyō from the total number of people who died: 10,000 - 3 = 9,997 Answer: At least 9,997"},{"question":"Q:Article: It takes years of school to develop math skills, but learning about numbers starts earlier than you might think. Now according to a new study, at three months, babies have already started acquiring a concept of \\"how much\\". Previous research had suggested that very young babies can tell when the number of objects in a group has changed. But the babies in these studies were simply reacting generally to the fact that something had changed, they suspected. Researchers of Harvard University studied 36 babies, all three months old. During the tests, each baby wore a hat with sensors . The babies watched a series of images on a computer screen. _ showed the same object, such as a cartoon character. For a while, the number of the objects in the pictures didn't change. Then the images began to display a different object, or a different number of one of the objects the babies had previously looked at. As soon as something changed, the babies' brains responded with a specific pattern of electrical signals, which would be recorded by sensors. By analyzing these signals, the researchers discovered that one part of the brain (near the top on the left side) responded when the object in the image changed. A different part of the brain (lower and on the right side) responded when the number of objects in the image changed. This was not the area of the brain that is involved in attention. That suggests that the babies' brains are doing more than just reacting to a change in what they're seeing - they actually seem to be able to tell number changes from other types of changes. Numbers and amounts are important concepts in our lives. Even though babies are years away from adding, subtracting , multiplying, and dividing, their brains seem to be preparing for a time when they finally will. Question: The purpose of the study is to prove that _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"babies really do have some sense of numbers\\"?

India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country.... A:","response":"The market-based economic reforms in India, the country that expanded its economy in the 17th century under the Mughal Empire, took place in the year 1991. These economic reforms marked a pivotal time in the history of India's economy. Prior to 1991, India exhibited characteristics of a closed economy, as it relied primarily on its internal markets and sought to minimize its interaction with the global economic order. In an attempt to achieve self-sustained growth and protect its economy from external volatility, India had high tariffs and import licensing, a prohibition on foreign direct investment, and a complex system of regulations and permissions known as the \\"License Raj.\\" Seeing the imperative need for change, Indian government leaders instituted a series of market-based economic reforms in 1991. This move towards liberalization, privatization, and globalization, often referred to as the LPG model, was a significant departure from the previous economic pattern of planning and control. Major reforms involved the reduction of import tariffs, the removal of import licensing, the deregulation of markets, and the encouragement of foreign direct investment. There was an introduction of competition in markets that were previously controlled by the government. Additionally, restrictions on private companies were abolished to foster competition, thereby resulting in a surge of economic growth. These significant economic changes helped India to become one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a newly industrialized country. By 2017, the Indian economy emerged as the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Therefore, the year 1991 is significant in the history of India's economy as it launched a new trajectory of growth by embarking on a path of market-based economic reforms."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

She was, successively, a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1915, after the SPD supported German involvement in World War I, she and Karl Liebknecht co-founded the anti-war Spartacus League (Spartakusbund), which eventually became the KPD. During the November Revolution she co-founded the newspaper Die Rote Fahne (\\"The Red Flag\\"), the central organ of the Spartacist movement. Context: Luxemburg was born on 5 March 1871, in Zamosc. She and her family were Polish Jews living in Russian-controlled Poland. She was the fifth and youngest child of timber trader Eliasz Luxemburg and Line Lowenstein. Luxemburg later stated that her father imparted an interest in liberal ideas in her, while her mother was religious and well read with books kept at home. The family spoke German and Polish, and Luxemburg also learned Russian. The family moved to Warsaw in 1873. After being bedridden with a hip ailment at the age of five, she was left with a permanent limp. Starting in 1880, Luxemburg attended a gymnasium. From 1886, she belonged to the Polish left-wing Proletariat Party (founded in 1882, anticipating the Russian parties by 20 years). She began political activities by organizing a general strike; as a result, four of the Proletariat Party leaders were put to death and the party was disbanded, though the remaining members, including Luxemburg, kept meeting in secret. In 1887, she passed her Matura (secondary school graduation) examinations. After fleeing to Switzerland to escape detention in 1889, she attended the University of Zurich (as did the socialists Anatoly Lunacharsky and Leo Jogiches), where she studied philosophy, history, politics, economics, and mathematics. She specialized in Staatswissenschaft (government science), the Middle Ages, and economic and stock exchange crises. Her doctoral dissertation, \\"The Industrial Development of Poland\\" (Die Industrielle Entwicklung Polens), was officially presented in the spring of 1897 at the University of Zurich, which awarded her a Doctor of Law degree. Her dissertation was published by Duncker and Humblot in Leipzig in 1898. She was an oddity in Zurich as she was one of the very few women with a doctorate. She plunged immediately into the politics of international Marxism, following in the footsteps of Georgi Plekhanov and Pavel Axelrod. In 1893, with Leo Jogiches and Julian Marchlewski (alias Julius Karski), Luxemburg founded the newspaper Sprawa Robotnicza (\\"The Workers' Cause\\"), which opposed the nationalist policies of the Polish Socialist Party. Luxemburg believed that an independent Poland could arise and exist only through socialist revolutions in Germany, Austria, and Russia. She maintained that the struggle should be against capitalism, not just for Polish independence. Her position of denying a national right of self-determination under socialism provoked a philosophic disagreement with Vladimir Lenin. She and Leo Jogiches co-founded the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) party, after merging Congress Poland's and Lithuania's social democratic organizations. Despite living in Germany for most of her adult life, Luxemburg was the principal theoretician of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP, later the SDKPiL), and led the party in a partnership with Jogiches, its principal organizer.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","response":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct to an extent. The Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh, indeed comprises twenty-four books, partitioned into three parts: the Torah, the Nevi'im, and the Ketuvim. However, it's important to note that the number of books in the Bible can vary depending on whether you are referring to the Jewish Bible, the Protestant Bible, or the Catholic Bible. The Jewish Bible, as mentioned, consists of twenty-four books, subdivided as follows: 1. The Torah (\\"teaching\\" or \\"law\\") contains five books - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. 2. The Nevi'im (\\"prophets\\") encapsulate eight books - Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets. 3. The Ketuvim (\\"writings\\") encompass eleven books - Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles. If you're referring to the Protestant Bible, it contains sixty-six books, which include the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The Old Testament's composition is similar to that of the Hebrew Bible but has a difference in the organization and grouping of the books. Moreover, the New Testament contains the Gospels, Acts, Pauline Epistles, General Epistles, and Revelation. In contrast, the Catholic Bible comprises seventy-three books, consisting of the forty-six books in the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books in the New Testament. The Catholic Old Testament includes some additional texts, known as the Deuterocanonical books, which are not present in the Protestant Old Testament. These extra books are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, 1 and 2 Maccabees, and some portions of Esther and Daniel. To summarize, the answer you found on Google is correct for the Hebrew Bible or the Tanakh. However, it is essential to consider the specific religious tradition and its corresponding canon when discussing the Bible, as the number of books can differ."},{"question":"Review: This is a great Canadian comedy series.

Fact 2: Fertile soil is loose, absorbent and pleasant smelling. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"The growth of plant roots is positively impacted by what kind of soil?\\" with the following options: - fertile - claggy - heavy - alluvial - sun's heat - salinity - warm - dense A:","response":"The growth of plant roots is positively impacted by fertile soil. Given Fact 1, we know the looseness of the soil has a positive impact on a plant's roots' growth in that soil. According to Fact 2, fertile soil is described as being loose, absorbent, and pleasant smelling. Therefore, fertile soil meets the requirements for facilitating better root growth. Let's analyze the other options to better understand why fertile soil is the correct answer: - Claggy soil: Claggy soil is sticky and clay-like, which impedes root growth due to its difficulty in permeability and oxygen exchange. Roots may struggle to penetrate and expand in this type of soil. - Heavy soil: This type of soil is typically dense and has a high clay content, making it difficult for plant roots to penetrate, find nutrients, and receive oxygen. Heavy soil restricts root growth, leading to stunted plants and poor yields. - Alluvial soil: Alluvial soil is usually found in river valleys and floodplains, and it's often rich in nutrients. However, alluvial soil may contain varying levels of sand, silt, and clay, making its structure inconsistent. While alluvial soil can be fertile, it is not the direct factor contributing to root growth. - Sun's heat: The sun's heat is related to the temperature of the soil. While soil temperature affects plant growth, it is not a characteristic of soil itself. Warmer temperatures may aid in root growth, but they do not define the type of soil in question. - Salinity: Salinity refers to the salt content of soil. High salinity can have negative effects on plant growth as it may cause osmotic stress and nutrient imbalances. Lower salt concentrations may be tolerated by specific plant species, but salinity itself does not positively impact root growth. - Warm: Warm describes the temperature, not the type of soil. While warmer temperatures can promote root growth, this term doesn't directly apply to soil composition. - Dense: Dense soil is compact and difficult for plant roots to penetrate. This type of soil can lead to poor root growth and overall plant health due to restrictions on water, oxygen, and nutrient availability. Given the explanation of the options presented, it is evident that the growth of plant roots is positively impacted by fertile soil, as it provides the necessary loose and absorbent structure that promotes healthy root development."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Step 1: Choose a general topic I will choose the general topic of nutrition, as it is a vital aspect of human health and touches on various aspects such as diet, exercise, and overall wellbeing.

Adam likes to fish and hunt at the campsite because he finds a sense of fulfilment and peace when engaging with the wild. Spending time in nature brings him closer to his primal instincts, and he loves the challenge of catching fish and tracking animals. For him, it's a way of connecting with the environment, understanding the delicate balance of ecosystems, and immersing himself in his natural surroundings. Furthermore, Adam is passionate about the skills and expertise needed to carry out these activities safely and responsibly. He takes pride in maintaining the welfare of the fish and wildlife he encounters and believes that his actions contribute to the overall health of the environment. On the other hand, Craig hides in the tent because while he appreciates the natural beauty and serenity of the outdoors, his passion lies more in observation and contemplation than direct engagement. This is not to say that Craig is disinterested or fearful; on the contrary, it's his deep-seated respect for nature that leads him to enjoy it in a more passive manner. He prefers to avoid potentially invasive activities such as fishing and hunting, opting instead for quiet moments spent listening to the sounds of the forest and observing the subtle interactions between plant and animal life. For Craig, retreating to the tent offers a comfortable space where he can process his experiences, reflect upon the sights and sounds of the outdoors, and pay homage to the sanctity of nature. In conclusion, both Adam and Craig have a love for nature, but their ways of engaging with and experiencing the outdoors differ significantly. Adam thrives on active, hands-on participation in fishing and hunting to connect with the environment, while Craig prefers retreating to the tent to observe and contemplate the natural world from a distance. This contrast in their interactions with the outdoors demonstrates that our connection to nature is unique to each individual and can manifest itself through a wide spectrum of interests and perspectives."},{"question":"Pirate gold.

In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the \\"Review of General Psychology\\"s list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century, and was the highest ranked woman on the list. - Hungry for Monsters is a 2003 documentary by George Paul Csicsery ( b , 1948 ) about false memory , focussing on Nicole Althaus ' disproved allegations of sexual abuse against her father , made when she was 15 years old . - False memory syndrome (FMS) describes a condition in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by memories that are factually incorrect but that they strongly believe. Peter J. Freyd originated the term, which the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) subsequently popularized. The term is not recognized as a psychiatric illness in any of the medical manuals, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-5; however, the principle that memories can be altered by outside influences is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists. - False memory is the psychological phenomenon in which a person recalls a memory that did not actually occur. False memory is often considered in legal cases regarding childhood sexual abuse. This phenomenon was initially investigated by psychological pioneers Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud. Freud wrote \\"The Aetiology of Hysteria\\", where he discussed repressed memories of childhood sexual trauma in their relation to hysteria. Elizabeth Loftus has, since her debuting research project in 1974, been a lead researcher in memory recovery and false memories. False memory syndrome recognizes false memory as a prevalent part of one's life in which it affects the person's mentality and day-to-day life. False memory syndrome differs from false memory in that the syndrome is heavily influential in the orientation of a person's life, while false memory can occur without this significant effect. The syndrome takes effect because the person believes the influential memory to be true. However, its research is controversial and the syndrome is excluded from identification as a mental disorder and, therefore, is also excluded from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. False memory is an important part of psychological research because of the ties it has to a large number of mental disorders, such as PTSD. - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. What object entity has the relation of 'main subject' with the subject 'hungry for monsters'? Choices: - austria - childhood - drug - false - language - medicine - memory - psychiatric hospital - psychoanalysis - psychology - sigmund freud - united states army The answer to this question is:","response":"'memory'. The 2003 documentary \\"Hungry for Monsters\\" by George Paul Csicsery mainly focuses on the concept of 'false memory'. The film centers on the disproved allegations of sexual abuse made by Nicole Althaus against her father when she was 15 years old. The narrative of the documentary delves deep into the impact of false memory on individuals and their relationships, offering a comprehensive exploration of how memories, even when factually incorrect, can significantly influence a person's life. In this context, 'memory' is the object entity that has the relation of 'main subject' with the subject 'hungry for monsters'. Other themes and topics such as 'childhood' and 'psychoanalysis' might also be relevant, but they are secondary compared to the central focus on 'memory'."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A little stress is good, since it helps you keep motivated to meet your goals. However, too much stress is bad for your health. Stress needs to be managed in order to prevent anxiety . Here are some tips on how to manage stress. Write it out Write down everything that seems stressful, and ways to deal with each problem. You'll find a things-to-do list much easier to manage than having all messed up in your head. Write down the tasks along with the specific times when you can do them. One task at a time Give each task all your attention while you're doing it, and forget the rest. This will keep you from feeling anxious about things you have left to do. Thinking about other tasks only adds unnecessary stress, and can even stop you from doing the task you're busy with at present. You don't need to do everything all at once, or on your own. The feeling of being pressed to finish something on time will somehow disappear if someone is there to help you. Give yourself a reward Rewarding yourself for what you've already done, no matter how small, is a great way to motivate yourself to keep going. It will reduce stress, and make you happier to go on with the next task. Give yourself a break Breaks of ten to fifteen minutes are important.

Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Tottenham's Stalled Deals amid Swansea's Troy Deeney Pursuit; Liverpool's Growing Interest in Origi and Markovic Tottenham Hotspur's transfer market moves have been a hot topic this summer, with the club seeking immediate reinforcements to secure a top-four finish in the upcoming Premier League season. However, recent negotiations involving Wilfried Bony, Ben Davies, and Michel Vorm have hit a stumbling block, as Swansea City and Tottenham have yet to come to an agreement. Amid these stalled talks, Swansea is reportedly interested in securing the services of £6 million-rated striker Troy Deeney from Watford as a potential replacement for the Ivorian Bony. It is understood that Tottenham's initial proposal, which included an exchange deal involving Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson for Swansea's Davies and Vorm, was rejected. Nevertheless, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino remains keen on acquiring the services of Bony and is reportedly tracking other notable players such as Divock Origi from Lille. Origi, a highly-rated young Belgian forward, has become a subject of interest for a number of top clubs, including Premier League rivals Liverpool. The 19-year-old, who impressed with his performances at the recently concluded FIFA World Cup in Brazil, was spotted at Liverpool's Melwood training ground on Wednesday. It is rumoured that Origi could become Brendan Rodgers' fourth signing of the summer, with a £9.8 million deal reportedly in the works. Liverpool's busy summer looks set to continue as Serbian winger Lazar Markovic is expected to undergo a medical at Anfield on Thursday. The Benfica sensation has attracted interest from several top European clubs, but it appears that Liverpool has won the race for his signature, with a £20 million deal believed to have been agreed upon. As Tottenham and Liverpool both vie for prominence in the Premier League and abroad, securing vital signings and strengthening key areas will be crucial in the coming weeks. While Spurs continue their pursuit of Bony and the young Origi, Liverpool's business looks to further bolster their attacking options after the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona. The coming days will undoubtedly offer more clarity on the status of these ongoing negotiations, as the Premier League giants continue to strengthen their squads ahead of the 2014-15 campaign.

The lawmaker, Efan al-Essawi, who owned a construction company, had gone to inspect a road that it was building to connect Falluja with the main highway in Anbar, a trade route that leads west to Syria and Jordan. The region has been embroiled in strife since last month, when protests, led mostly by Sunnis, broke out against the Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The demonstrations continued in Anbar on Tuesday. Officials said that the suicide attacker, disguised as a worker, approached Mr. Essawi and blew himself up, killing Mr. Essawi and wounding one of his guards. Mr. Essawi had escaped many assassination attempts before. In 2009, attackers placed a magnetic bomb on the armored car that he was using when he was a candidate for Parliament, the first attack on a candidate as those elections approached. He avoided serious injury in that episode. The province called for three days of mourning for Mr. Essawi, a prominent local figure, and members of his largely Sunni bloc of lawmakers, Iraqiya, boycotted a session of Parliament in protest over the inability of the government to respond to the demands of the demonstrators and its failure to provide adequate security. “Today our ministers have boycotted the session in the cabinet, as they want to send a message to say that we are closer to the street, not the government,” Leqa Mahdi, a member of Iraqiya from Anbar Province, said in a telephone interview. “This boycott will continue until the government responds to the demands of the demonstrators, until the parties sit down and find real solutions for the current crisis.” It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack on Mr. Essawi, but one of his close associates said he had seen in a text message a threat by Al Qaeda against Mr. Essawi that said, “We will kill you even if it was the last day on earth.” The assassination comes as Iraq grapples with political turmoil. A raid last month by security forces on the office and home of the Sunni finance minister, Rafe al-Essawi, and the arrest of 10 bodyguards inflamed tempers and stirred charges that Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, was monopolizing power and marginalizing Sunnis ahead of provincial elections scheduled for April. Rafe al-Essawi is not related to Efan al-Essawi. Over the past few weeks, thousands of Sunnis have staged protests, mostly in Anbar, to show their anger against the government. They and senior opposition politicians have made repeated calls for Mr. Maliki to resign. Iraqi government television reported that Mr. Maliki said Tuesday that the killers of the lawmaker would be tracked down and punished. Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"This news story is about an important person named Efan al-Essawi from Iraq, who was a leader and helped make decisions for his country.

Tetraplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) and a patrol cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), team up to solve a string of murders connected to a serial killer by his signature: a single shard of bone removed from each of the victims. Rhyme was paralyzed from the neck down in an earlier accident and is bed-bound and completely reliant on machines and his nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah). The killer poses as a New York City taxi driver and abducts and kills those who get in his taxi. The first victims are a married couple named Alan and Lindsay Rubin that the killer picked up at the airport. Amelia finds Alan's body buried in a Civil War-era railroad bed. She also finds a collection of clues including a pile of piece-ground oyster shells, which eventually leads Amelia - now working with Rhyme - to Alan's wife, and a scrap of paper. The detectives find Mrs. Rubin, too late, at a steam junction in a below-ground services area of a building in the Financial District, secured using old antique handcuffs or shackles at the mouth of a pipe which emits steam. She has been scalded to death from the steam. The killer has also removed a bit of flesh and bone from her arm. Amelia finds another scrap of paper at the scene. The killer then abducts an NYU student, who is taken to a derelict slaughterhouse where he is tied to a pole. Part of his thigh bone is surgically removed, and he is left for rats to feed on. Amelia and Rhyme, using the clues left by the killer at the scene of Lindsay Rubin's death, find the victim dead. Again, the killer has removed a piece of the victim's bone. Amelia is able to collect the evidence, including another scrap of paper. The pressure of the tense investigation and bureaucratic challenges to both Amelia's and Rhyme's involvement with the case are having serious impacts on Rhyme's health and stability. After piecing together the message the killer was sending using the scraps of paper, Amelia and Rhyme are led to an old crime novel, whose crimes...

(2) In 1858 , he moved with a group of four members from Downieville to Eagle Valley in the area that is now known as Nevada . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","response":"These two sentences contain similar information but have different meanings due to the ordering of locations and the way they are phrased. 1. In the first sentence, \\"In 1858 he moved with a group of four members from Nevada to Downieville to the area which is now known as Eagle Valley.\\" It suggests that the person and the group of four members were initially located in Nevada and moved to Downieville, which is the area that is now known as Eagle Valley. So, in this sentence, Eagle Valley is a part of Downieville which was moved to from Nevada. 2. In the second sentence, \\"In 1858, he moved with a group of four members from Downieville to Eagle Valley in the area that is now known as Nevada.\\" This sentence states that the person and the group of four members were initially located in Downieville and moved to Eagle Valley, which is located in the area that is now known as Nevada. In this sentence, Eagle Valley is a part of Nevada, and it was their destination after they moved from Downieville. In summary, the first sentence claims that Eagle Valley is in Downieville, while the second sentence claims that Eagle Valley is within the area now known as Nevada.

(English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy... Answer:","response":"The works that require three voices, including a narrator, as mentioned in the article are \\"Il combattimento\\" and \\"Armida abbandonata.\\" Both works have structural similarities in their needs for three voices, with one voice acting as the narrator."},{"question":"Two counties paid a study about acid rain. They found out Hill county had experienced that, while New county hadn't. Which county experienced less air pollution? Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.

Sentence A: \\"He put fish on the chair.\\" This sentence makes sense as it's describing an action where someone placed fish (either as food or a pet) on a chair. This might be an unusual situation, but the sentence is grammatically correct. Sentence B: \\"He fell of the chair.\\" This sentence contains a grammatical error, as the correct preposition should be \\"off\\" rather than \\"of.\\" The corrected sentence should be: \\"He fell off the chair.\\" Once corrected, the sentence makes sense, describing an action where someone fell from a chair.

It's an absolute temperature scale, which means it has its zero point at absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature that a physical system can attain, where all molecular motion ceases. Step 2: Identify the variable measured using the Rankine scale The Rankine scale is used to measure temperature, specifically in the field of thermodynamics and engineering. It measures temperatures in \\"degrees Rankine\\" (°R or °Ra).

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

Answer the above question based on the context below: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century.

Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

Jackson, who shares guardianship of Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- with their grandmother.

The days following the trial were tense, filled with a constant buzz of media coverage and speculation. People from all over the world gathered outside the courthouse, eagerly waiting to hear the final verdict. The trial went on for weeks, with witnesses coming forward and presenting crucial pieces of evidence. Young and old came to testify, sharing their fondest memories of Michael Jackson, while also revealing the darker side of the music industry that could have played a part in his untimely death. Finally, the day of the verdict arrived. The courtroom was packed with family members, friends, and supporters, all waiting for the judge's final words. The judge, after hearing the closing arguments, sent the jury out to deliberate the fate of AEG Live and the damages sought by the Jackson family. After hours of intense deliberation, the jury returned with their verdict. The jury found that AEG Live was not liable for Michael Jackson's death and that Dr. Conrad Murray, who was already convicted of involuntary manslaughter, acted independently in his actions that led to Michael Jackson's death. The crowd in the courthouse erupted into mixed emotions - some relieved, while others dismayed at the outcome. In spite of the verdict, the Jackson family vowed to keep Michael's legacy alive and to continue to seek justice for his death. They expressed their disappointment at the decision, but also their gratitude for the support they received throughout the trial. Over time, the media coverage gradually subsided, and the world began to move on. However, the whispers of conspiracy and unanswered questions surrounding Michael Jackson's death never truly disappeared. His fans and family continued to honor his memory, celebrating his life and music while still yearning for answers about the events that led to his tragic end. As for Michael's children - Prince, Paris, and Blanket - they grew up under the guardianship of T.J. Jackson and their grandmother, finding solace in one another as they navigated life without their father. They remained connected to his spirit through his art, inspired by his message of love and unity, and determined to follow in his philanthropic footsteps. And so, in the hearts of his children and fans across the world, Michael Jackson's legacy endured, ensuring that the King of Pop would never truly be forgotten."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

We have the equation: 5469 * i + 34095 = -135444 To find the value of 'i', we need to follow these steps: 1. Let's first remove the extra number (34095) from both sides of the equation. So, we'll subtract 34095 from both sides: 5469 * i = -135444 - 34095 2. Now, let's calculate the result of -135444 - 34095: -135444 - 34095 = -169539 That gives us: 5469*i = -169539 3. Now we've got to divide -169539 by 5469 to find 'i': i = -169539/5469 4. When we calculate that, we get: i ≈ -30.96 So, the answer is i ≈ -30.96.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'drew casper'?

Let's break down its components to further analyze its structure and understand why it's grammatically correct. 1. Subject: \\"He\\" is the subject of the sentence, referring to a specific male individual. 2. Verb: \\"is\\" is the main verb in the sentence, specifically, the linking verb \\"to be\\" in its singular present form. The verb agrees with the singular subject \\"He,\\" which is essential for subject-verb agreement in English grammar. 3. Predicate: The rest of the sentence— \\"the only person that I can rely on\\"— functions as the predicate, providing additional information about the subject. 4. Noun phrase: \\"the only person\\" is a noun phrase consisting of the definite article \\"the,\\" the adjective \\"only,\\" and the noun \\"person.\\" Additionally, the adjective effectively expresses the unique nature of the subject. 5. Relative clause: \\"that I can rely on\\" is a relative (or adjective) clause providing further information about the noun \\"person\\" and its relationship to the speaker. The clause begins with the relative pronoun \\"that,\\" which introduces the clause and indicates that the person referenced is essential for the sentence's meaning. Therefore, \\"that\\" is used instead of \\"who,\\" which provides non-restrictive information about the noun. 6. Subject and verb within the relative clause: The pronoun \\"I\\" functions as the subject within the relative clause, followed by the modal verb \\"can,\\" which denotes ability or possibility. The main verb in this clause is \\"rely,\\" and the preposition \\"on\\" follows it, creating a phrasal verb. It is essential to maintain the subject-verb agreement within the relative clause as well. 7. Preposition at the end of the sentence: Although some people might argue that ending a sentence with a preposition is not acceptable, it is generally agreed upon in modern usage that ending a sentence with a preposition is acceptable in informal and formal writing, as long as the sentence communicates the intended meaning effectively. In this case, \\"on\\" is appropriately placed at the end of the sentence because the phrasal verb \\"rely on\\" conveys the intended meaning more clearly than attempting to restructure the sentence and move the preposition elsewhere. To conclude, the test sentence \\"He is the only person that I can rely on.\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence with a clear and concise meaning. The sentence follows the subject-verb agreement rules, effectively uses a relative clause, and communicates its intended message with clarity."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: The trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower's resignation in December 1950, when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe.

Translate to English","response":"This would be the first time that the recently adopted Access to Information Act by the Parliament in Zimbabwe would be applied. The given sentence in German, \\"Dies wäre das erste Mal, dass das vor kurzem vom Parlament in Simbabwe angenommene Gesetz zum Informationszugang Anwendung findet,\\" translates to \\"This would be the first time that the recently adopted Access to Information Act by the Parliament in Zimbabwe would be applied\\" in English. The Access to Information Act is a piece of legislation that was recently passed by the Parliament in Zimbabwe. The aim of this act is to provide the public with greater access to information held by public bodies and to promote transparency and accountability. With the passage of this law, Zimbabwe is taking a step toward embracing democratic values and principles, as access to information is critical in empowering citizens to participate effectively in all aspects of society. Under this legislation, citizens will have the right to request information from public bodies, which will be required to provide responses within a specified timeframe. This can help to prevent corruption or the misuse of public resources by ensuring that public officials are held accountable for their actions. It also promotes a culture of openness and transparency, which is essential for building trust between government and citizens. However, the successful implementation of the Access to Information Act in Zimbabwe will also depend on the government's commitment to enforcing the law and ensuring that public officials comply with its provisions. This may require the government to invest in training and capacity-building initiatives to ensure that public officials are aware of their responsibilities under the Act and have the necessary skills to respond to information requests. Additionally, establishing an independent oversight body could also help to ensure that the Act is implemented effectively and that any complaints or disputes that arise in relation to information requests are resolved fairly and impartially. In summary, this newly adopted Access to Information Act in Zimbabwe marks an important step towards strengthening democracy and accountability in the country. By providing citizens with greater access to information, the Act can help to empower individuals to better engage in the political process and demand accountability from public officials. However, the Act's effectiveness will also depend on the government's commitment to its implementation and willingness to invest in the necessary resources to ensure that public officials are able to respond effectively to information requests."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Do you have any questions?","response":"The Early British Period In 1655, Great Britain succeeded in capturing Jamaica from the Spanish, marking the beginning of a long British rule in the island. Led by Admiral William Penn and General Robert Venables, British forces first invaded Hispaniola and failed. Subsequently, they decided to turn their attention to nearby Jamaica, and overtook the Spanish with little resistance. Spain officially ceded Jamaica to Britain in 1670, with the signing of the Treaty of Madrid. During the early British rule, the island's agriculture experienced rapid growth and the colony established itself as an important producer of sugar, cocoa, and coffee. Much of this prosperity was built on the back of a large population of African slaves. The brutal institution of slavery reigned for more than a century in Jamaica, causing intense suffering and the establishment of a highly stratified, racially divided society. Slave Rebellion and Emancipation In the late 18th century, several slave rebellions began to emerge, fueled by resentment against the brutal treatment they experienced. The most notable rebellion took place in 1831, led by Samuel Sharpe – a Baptist deacon and slave. Known as the Baptist War or Christmas Rebellion, it ultimately resulted in the British Parliament passing the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, which came into effect on August 1, 1834. Although this Act abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, there was still some resistance and unwillingness to grant full freedom to the now former slaves in Jamaica. This led to a transitional period of apprenticeship, lasting until 1838, when full emancipation was granted. Post-Emancipation and the Struggle for Independence Post-emancipation Jamaica saw significant social, economic, and political changes. Many former slaves started their own small farms, growing various cash crops, while others became laborers on the large estates of the European landowners. The overall landscape of the island shifted towards agriculture and agrarian production. However, tensions and conflicts persisted between European settlers and the indigenous population. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jamaica underwent a series of political and social changes, as a growing sense of nationalism and desire for self-rule emerged. The formation of the People's National Party (PNP) in 1938 and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) in 1943 helped channel the aspirations of the Jamaican people for self-determination and independence. In 1944, limited self-government was granted, followed by a new constitution in 1953, which provided for direct elections. Subsequently, Jamaica was granted full internal self-government in 1958 and became a founding member of the West Indies Federation – a British-led federation of Caribbean countries aimed at achieving regional autonomy. On August 6, 1962, Jamaica gained full independence from Britain, concluding centuries of domination by colonial powers. The nation has since flourished and established a unique identity in the Caribbean region, growing in strength in terms of cultural, economic, and political influence. Jamaica has faced and continues to face numerous challenges, but remains a proud and independent nation with a rich cultural and historical heritage.

Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Island Records is a Jamaican-English record label that operates as a division of the Universal Music Group (UMG). It was founded by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959. Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989. Both Island and another label recently acquired byPolyGram, A&M Records, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s. - Cold Chillin' Records was a record label that released some music in the golden age of hip hop from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. A producer-and-crew label founded by manager Tyrone Williams and run by Len Fichtelberg (d. November 4, 2010), most of the label's releases were by members of the Juice Crew, a loosely knit group of artists centered on producer Marley Marl. In 1998, the label shut down and the majority of its expansive catalog was bought by Massachusetts-based LandSpeed Records (now Traffic Entertainment). - Hip hop is a subcultural art movement that was formed during the early 1970s primarily by African-American and Afro Puerto Rican youths residing in the South Bronx in New York City. Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify. - \`\` Mother Mother '' is a song by Tracy Bonham from her debut album The Burdens of Being Upright .

Every cat doesn't like mice, for example Felix doesn't. Choose from: +unacceptable; +acceptable;","response":"A linguist would likely find the sentence \\"Every cat doesn't like mice, for example Felix doesn't.\\" to be unacceptable as a valid English sentence grammatically. Let's break down the sentence and identify the reasons why it might be considered unacceptable. 1. Ambiguity: The main issue with the sentence is that it can be interpreted in two different ways: a) The intended meaning is probably that not every cat likes mice, and Felix is an example of such a cat. In this case, the sentence should be rephrased to: \\"Not every cat likes mice; for example, Felix doesn't.\\" b) The other possible interpretation is that every cat dislikes mice, and Felix is just another cat that shares this universal dislike. This interpretation is highly unlikely, and the provided sentence doesn't convey this meaning effectively. To state this, it would be better to use: \\"All cats dislike mice, and Felix is no exception.\\" 2. Punctuation and Comma Usage: There are issues with the use of commas in the sentence. The comma after \\"mice\\" should ideally be replaced with a semicolon to properly separate and emphasize the two independent clauses in the sentence. Furthermore, there should be a comma between \\"example\\" and \\"Felix\\" to set off the introductory phrase. Given these issues, the sentence would be considered unacceptable grammatically. A more acceptable version of the sentence, following the improvements suggested above, would read: \\"Not every cat likes mice; for example, Felix doesn't.\\" This revision eliminates the ambiguity and corrects the punctuation, resulting in a sentence that is more likely to be deemed grammatically acceptable by a linguist."},{"question":"Choose your answer from: A). negative.

The verdict against Anjem Choudary, 49, is the first major conviction against a man seen across Europe as a Pied Piper for young radicals and a cheerleader for the Islamic State. His conviction immediately became the most significant example of how Britain and other European nations are moving to expand their counterterrorism operations, targeting not just active cells but also the voices of incitement. A top associate of Choudary — Mohammed Rahman, 33 — was also convicted, and both now face up to 10 years of jail time. The verdict came after years in which both men had mostly dodged British justice, doing so by successfully playing the same democratic system they often railed against. [In Britain, Islamist extremist Anjem Choudary proves elusive] Choudary is a trained lawyer, and maintained that his polemics — he called for strict Islamic law in Britain and turning Buckingham Palace into a mosque — were expressions of free speech designed to “bait” the British press. His conviction, however, came after he appeared to cross a line by openly supporting the Islamic State. In lectures and statements posted on social media and YouTube, he encouraged youths to embrace the Islamic State and denied its documented war atrocities, prosecutors said. In one piece of vital evidence, officials said, he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader in a conversation with a convicted Islamic State recruiter. “These two men knowingly sought to legitimize a terrorist organization and encouraged others to support it,” Sue Hemming, head of counterterrorism for the Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement. “They used the power of social media to attempt to influence those who are susceptible to these types of messages, which might include the young or vulnerable.” The men were convicted on June 28, but the verdict was announced Tuesday, after the conclusion of a related trial. They are set for sentencing on Sept. 6. Counterterrorism officials and experts have long described Choudary — a soft-spoken orator with a salt-and-pepper beard known for wearing traditional Muslim robes — as a leading figure in the dark networks across Europe that have fostered homegrown extremism and encouraged young Muslims to fight in the Middle East. “These men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counterterrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organizations,” Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command. [Britain’s anti-terrorism strategy tested by move against prominent preacher] Choudary, however, has described a crusade against him by authorities. \\"If I had even sent one person abroad, really sent them abroad, if they could link that to me, then surely I would have been in court under the anti-terrorism legislation a long time ago,\\" Choudary told Sky News last month. \\"If you look at my speeches, I have said the same thing for 20 years. For me, it is a matter of worship.” Yet authorities say that looking at his speeches -- and more -- is precisely what led to his conviction. During the investigation, Haydon said, 20 years’ worth of material was considered. They included information recovered from 333 electronic devices containing 12.1 terabytes of storage data. In a meeting in a restaurant in July 2014, Choudary and Rahman used Skype and phone texts to contact Mohammed Fachry, a man convicted of recruiting for the Islamic State in Indonesia, and pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The oath, signed by Choudary, was promptly published by Fachry on an Indonesian website, police said. Via social and traditional media, Choudary has openly defended known terrorists and called for the spread of Islamic law. His comments often harbored an air of the grandiose, leaving some wondering whether he was a publicity hound more than anything else. “We believe there will be complete domination of the world by Islam,” he told The Washington Post in 2014. “That may sound like some kind of James Bond movie — you know, Dr. No and world domination and all that. But we believe it.” But over the past 15 years, counterterrorism experts say, the majority of Britons convicted of offenses related to Islamic extremism have been members or supporters of his shadowy organizations. They included the two men charged with slaughtering Lee Rigby, a British army soldier killed on the streets of London in May 2013. Yet other than a minor charge for holding an illegal demonstration, a series of allegations against Choudary never really stuck. In September, 2014, however, exasperated British authorities arrested Choudary and Rahman after mounting their most rigorous case against them of \\"inviting support\\" of the Islamic State. Officials focused intensely on their web casts. \\"The lesson...is that obedience to the caliph is an obligation, if they rule by the sharia,\\" Choudary says in one audio clip -- since taken down from the Internet -- according to the Guardian. \\"And to obey them obviously means they must be established.\\" A detailed report compiled on Choudary by Hate Not Hope, a British anti-extremist organization, portrays Choudary as a sinister but savvy figure with deep connections to extremism. Well over 100 Britons with some connection to Choudary and his al-Muhajiroun network have gone to Syria to fight, the group said. Choudary has disputed that he ever coaxed jihadists to go and fight. But he routinely painted the Islamic State as a religious utopia. “If you look now in the area controlled by the Islamic State, the Jews, the Muslims and the Christians are living side by side in security,” he once told the Guardian. “It’s not true that people are being slaughtered. Those people who are allied with the previous regime or those who are fighting against the Muslims, certainly they will be fought against.” Choudary also maintained early and long ties with a host of other radical groups across Europe, including Sharia4Belgium. That group is now labeled a terrorist organization in Belgium, and authorities see it as an incubator of homegrown terror and young jihadists who have joined the Islamic State. “It seems incredulous that he was allowed to continue all these years,” said Nick Lowles, executive director of Hope Not Hate, a British anti-extremist organization. “This really does put an end to his organization. Others will try to step into his place. But the people who come after him won’t have the same credibility or media profile.” Karla Adam contributed to this report.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Options: A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations B. because President Moon wants him to C. because he said he would D. not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"A. because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations The primary reason President Trump wants North Korea to denuclearize is to ensure peace and stability in the region as well as to remove the potential threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program to the United States and its allies. North Korea's nuclear capabilities have raised concerns internationally due to its history of unstable leadership and provocative behavior. Denuclearizing North Korea would be a significant step in improving the security situation on the Korean Peninsula, and it would reduce the likelihood of a nuclear standoff or conflicts in the region. In addition, it would help to strengthen international non-proliferation norms and show that diplomacy can lead to positive outcomes in dealing with nuclear issues. Furthermore, President Trump believes that denuclearization would benefit North Korea itself, as it could help to end its isolation, rehabilitate its economy, and pave the way for potential investments from the US and other countries. This would create an opportunity for North Korea to improve the standard of living for its citizens and decrease the likelihood of an internal collapse or regime change. To summarize, President Trump wants North Korea to denuclearize to promote regional stability, enhance global non-proliferation efforts, and bring forth potential benefits to North Korea, the United States, and other nations in terms of security, economic development, and peaceful relations."},{"question":"In this task, you are given an input list.

The narrator might have been in the mood for something sweet to end their quick meal before heading back home. Ultimately, there are numerous possibilities for what the narrator may have eaten at McDonald's.

These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation.

In English, capitalizing the first letter of the first word in a sentence is a fundamental aspect of written communication. It helps distinguish the beginning of a thought or idea and allows the reader to follow the flow of information more efficiently. Furthermore, capitalizing proper nouns is also an essential aspect of English grammar. Capitalization helps differentiate between common nouns, which represent a general class of people, things, or ideas, and proper nouns that represent specific individuals, organizations, or entities. Examples of proper nouns include names of people, like Mary or Tom, names of countries, such as France or Canada, and titles of books or movies, such as The Catcher in the Rye or Star Wars.

Now let's find out how many more apples are on one side by subtracting 4570 from both sides: 4822 - 4570 = 7*p + 4570 - 4570 This simplifies to: 252 = 7*p 3.

Both sentences convey the same general meaning, which is the role of the Irfon in defining the northern boundary of a particular area. However, there are a few differences in the structure and word choice between the two sentences, which are essential aspects of paraphrasing. Let's analyze these differences: Original sentence: \\"The Irfon defines the northern limit of the Mynydd Epynt area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Builth Wells.\\" Paraphrased sentence: \\"Irfon defines the northern border of the Builth Wells area between Llanwrtyd Wells and Mynydd Epynt.\\" 1. In the original sentence, the definite article \\"the\\" is used before \\"Irfon,\\" whereas it is omitted in the paraphrased sentence. This is a minor change, but it helps to highlight that the sentences are not identical. 2. The original sentence describes the northern limit as \\"the northern limit of the Mynydd Epynt area.\\" In the paraphrased sentence, it is described as \\"the northern border of the Builth Wells area.\\" This change involves using \\"border\\" instead of \\"limit\\" and changing the focus area's name that is limited by Irfon from \\"Mynydd Epynt\\" to \\"Builth Wells.\\" Although the terms and the focus area changed, the overall meaning remains the same, considering that both sentences still point out the northern boundary defined by the Irfon. 3. The order of the locations \\"Llanwrtyd Wells,\\" \\"Builth Wells,\\" and \\"Mynydd Epynt\\" is changed between the two sentences, but their relationship remains the same. In both cases, the Irfon defines the northern boundary between two locations, highlighting the same geographic connection between these places. In conclusion, the two sentences are indeed paraphrases, as they communicate the same essential information about the Irfon defining a northern boundary between specific locations, despite the differences in structure and word choice. These differences help to rephrase the original sentence while maintaining its overall meaning."},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a question.

A:","response":"The best answer for the question \\"How do animals lungs help them survive?\\" is: \\"They help them breathe.\\" To elaborate, lungs are essential organs in the respiratory system of many animals, especially mammals. They facilitate the exchange of gases, mainly oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is crucial for an animal's survival. Essentially, when an animal breathes in, oxygen-rich air travels through the respiratory system and ultimately reaches the lungs, where it gets absorbed by tiny blood vessels (capillaries) surrounding the millions of air sacs (alveoli). Oxygen is then transported throughout the body via the bloodstream to be utilized by cells for energy production via cellular respiration. Similarly, carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular respiration, is carried back to the lungs by the bloodstream, where it diffuses into the alveoli and is expelled from the body when the animal exhales. Hence, lungs play a vital role in ensuring animals have a constant supply of oxygen while eliminating waste products (carbon dioxide) produced by the body cells. This efficient gas exchange mechanism mediated by the lungs enables animals to maintain physical and metabolic functionality, which in turn allows them to survive and thrive in different environmental conditions. In contrast, the other answer choices mentioned, such as \\"it keeps an organism warm,\\" \\"They help them drink water,\\" and \\"They help them sleep,\\" are not directly related to the primary function of lungs in animals. While those factors may contribute to an animal's overall health and well-being, it is the ability to breathe and exchange essential gases that the lungs provide, which plays a critical role in an animal's survival."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: arms traders for the following movie plot: Sonu Dilli (Emraan Hashmi)(KKC Kutti Kamini Cheez ) is a street-smart, small time arms dealer in Delhi who has the gift of gab.

There's really no reason to compare the two, except maybe for the similar scenery in the final showdown. Now that that's out of the way I'll go into why The Flock is very interesting in some respects. Mostly it's a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders. At the very beginning you can clearly see his work has got the better of him. Evident in two scenes where first he's interviewing an offender and slaps him around and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think of are his standard questions from his questionnaire. Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of performing his job is not unlike that of a police officer, he carries a gun and is constantly checking newspapers and supplies law officials with information if some of his \\"flock\\" may be responsible for a sexual crime. He's also a person who's lost all happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from exacting his own vigilante justice on his flock. Twice you see him smile, once when he's apologizing for treating his partner rudely and the other after he's beaten up a member of his flock. As a suspense flick, The Flock isn't as successful. Somewhat confusing and with some irritating plot holes but it does have a number of striking set pieces. Overall The Flock is a solid drama about a man performing a dehumanizing job and in the end he has to work hard to keep from being swallowed by the abyss he's surrounded himself in. The world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can distance himself from the worst the happier that person is. The Flock gets that point across nicely. Choose your answer.

In 3rd party launchers it doesn't allow to create shortcuts in app drawers so please allow us to create homescreen widgets with this app.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? The answer is:","response":"Maybe. The mentioned review suggests that certain features (such as creating widgets) could be improved, specifically when using 3rd party launchers, which might impact users' experience with the application. However, it is important to consider several factors before making a recommendation to a friend. These factors include personal preferences, the overall functionality of the app, their experience with launchers, reviews from other users, and the significance of the widgets feature to their usage. 1. Personal Preferences: It is essential to factor in the friend's needs and preferences, as what may be a drawback to one person might not matter to another. If the friend is particular about using widgets, then this app might not be their first choice, especially if using a 3rd party launcher. However, if they don't find this restriction significant, then the app could be suitable for them. 2. Overall Functionality: Gauge the general performance of the app, apart from the mentioned feature. If the app provides excellent other features, you may still consider recommending it, despite the widget creation limitations. Carefully weigh the pros and cons of the app and determine if the mentioned drawback outweighs its advantages. 3. Experience with Launchers: Evaluate the friend's experience with using app launchers, specifically 3rd party ones. If they tend to use default launchers, the mentioned issue may not be relevant to them. 4. Reviews from Other Users: To make a well-informed decision, analyze feedback from other users in addition to the mentioned review. Look for patterns in user issues and see if a general consensus highlights certain pros or cons. The more opinions and experiences you can consider, the better you can gauge whether the app will be suitable for your friend. 5. Significance of Widgets: Determine how essential widgets are in the friend's app usage. If they rely heavily on widgets, they may find the app restrictive. On the other hand, if they rarely use widgets, the mentioned issue might not be a significant concern. In conclusion, recommending this app to a friend depends on various factors, including the individual's preferences, overall app functionality, familiarity with third-party launchers, and the importance of widgets to their app usage. Carefully consider all these aspects before making a decision, and take time to evaluate other options available on the market. For now, the answer is \\"Maybe\\" as more information and factors need to be considered before a definite recommendation can be made."},{"question":"(CNN) -- It is not easy to capture a man's life in 152 minutes, let alone a life as illustrious and complex as Nelson Mandela's.

Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester.

As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade, which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world, created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African slaves. Drawing on Classical sources and upon their own internal interactions — for example, the hostility between the English and Irish powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences between people — Europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical appearance, and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained. A set of folk beliefs took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to inherited intellectual, behavioral, and moral qualities. Similar ideas can be found in other cultures, for example in China, where a concept often translated as \\"race\\" was associated with supposed common descent from the Yellow Emperor, and used to stress the unity of ethnic groups in China. Brutal conflicts between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world.

The scientific revolution, which took place from the 16th to the 18th century, introduced and prioritized the study of natural kinds, while European imperialism and colonization led to interactions between Europeans and people from different parts of the world. These historical and cultural factors contributed to the European development of racial categorization and the subsequent linking of physical appearance to assumed intellectual, behavioral, and moral qualities. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade also provided further incentive to classify human groups, as it was used to justify the subjugation of African slaves by their European captors."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

This is a rush transcript from \\"Special Report,\\" July 11, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's not going to get easier. It's going to get harder. So we might as well do it now. Pull off the band aid. Eat our peas. Now is the time to do it. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: There was never any agreement to allow tax rates to go up in any discussion I've ever had with the White House. Not once. BAIER: The president today repeating that he still wants a big deal, meeting again this afternoon at the White House with both sides, Speaker Boehner saying tax increases, a nonstarter for his caucus. It just can't get through. Meantime, there is word that to reach a grand debt deal, sources say President Obama offered to raise the Medicare eligibility rate from 65 to 67. Late today, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said this, quote, \\"We continue to oppose benefit cuts in Social Security and Medicare. These pillars of the economic and health security should not be used as a piggybank to subsidize tax cuts for the wealthy.\\" Where are we on this? Let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, Juan Williams, columnist with The Hill, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles, let's start with you. First of all, the tone and tenor of the president's news conference -- you have written about this, about the chances he has had to address this big issue up until now. What were your thoughts about it? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Look, he adopts this position of being the Olympian observer of all of this, above all the squabbling. Everyone else plays politics, but he acts in the national interest. And he says, you know, if not now, when? All of a sudden, he has decided we have to have a big deal, not a small deal. For months he insisted we have no deal. For months he insisted that we have a debt ceiling increase with no cuts at all, and now all of a sudden, only a big deal. And he says, if not now, when? How about in February when he as president submitted a budget that increased the deficit? All of a sudden he is a man who wants to be the one who cuts the deficit and the debt. It's a farce. And you see it in the threat he made where he said, I will not sign a short-term extension. Let's say we are in negotiations and we are approaching and we want something real like tax reform, which takes a few months, and Republicans will pass a tax reform -- will pass a debt ceiling increase for say three months to allow negotiations. He says he will veto it because he is acting in the national interest, has to be a big deal. I think the Republicans are gonna call the bluff on this. There is no way in which that if the House approves a three-month extension with cuts, commensurate relatively small cuts, that the Senate will oppose it this and the president will veto it, because then he gets the blame for the catastrophe that he and Geithner have been protecting. BAIER: Juan, what about that? I mean if this deal does not work out and both sides stick to their points and the House moves forward a short-term deal that the president says he is not going to sign, it doesn't get past the Senate. Even if it does, it gets stopped at the White House. Then is it in White House's political court in dealing with this crisis? JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, THE HILL: No. It will come across as a prank, as basically a ploy by Republicans to try to save face and cover for the fact that they have blocked what everyone sees is a deal that really met the needs, the demands of Republicans up front. BAIER: But do you really believe there was a deal as of Saturday before John Boehner stepped out? WILLIAMS: They were close, I don't think there was an actual deal. But they were closer. And I think John Boehner is much more about let's get something done. Let's say that we, a divided government, a Democrat in the White House, Republican majority in the House, were able to achieve something for the American people at a time of crisis. I think John Boehner really believed that, wanted that to happen. I don't think that's the case with Eric Cantor who I think is challenging John Boehner's leadership. And I think when I listen to Charles, I think, you know, Republicans get off on hectoring President Obama. President Obama is not perfect. He has lots of flaws. But the idea to go back months and say, well President Obama should have done this months ago. Wait a minute, he has conceded on everything from entitlement reform, right, which is what Republicans said they want, to spending cuts, and yet Republicans say, no, we can't have a deal, we refuse to have a deal. And he's made it bigger in terms of the entitlement reform than Republicans ever thought was possible. KRAUTHAMMER: What has he conceded on entitlement reform? WILLIAMS: He was talking about Social Security. He is talking about Medicare. KRAUTHAMMER: What is he going to do on Social Security? Give me one specific-- WILLIAMS: Specifically, he was talking about raising the age, raising the age at which you would qualify. KRAUTHAMMER: [INAUDIBLE] Right. He talked about it in public, he said he wants to do it? BAIER: No, he hasn't -- WILLIAMS: -- in a negotiation Charles. KRAUTHAMMER: He has never said one thing -- WILLIAMS: Charles, I don't know what you want. You want them to negotiate on Fox News? KRAUTHAMMER: He's told us the tax increases he wants. He's told us exactly what he wants Republicans to do on taxes. He has never once stated a cut, a structural change in entitlements. He had an hour of a press conference in which he could do it. All we got was a leak, an hour after implying that he might do X. How about doing one statement in public? BAIER: The suggestion, Steve, is that this is all kabuki theater. STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: It is. I mean, this is exactly right. If the president wanted to give anything specific, he could have done it in public. It suggests to me that he is not actually serious about it. It polls well. When you say you want to get serious about entitlements, people say well I like that. And if you say, I want to get serious about debt and spending, people say, well I like that. It's when you actually offer specifics, like Paul Ryan did in his budget, which was passed by the House Republicans, that is when you run into potential political peril. And the president is totally unwilling to do that. So he is in favor of general vague entitlement reform. He's not in favor of anything specific in any way that he can be held accountable for it. But I think there was a very important moment today in this press conference when he's talking about his unwillingness to assign something that was shorter, something 60 days, or 90 days, or 120 day. Think about that. Think about what that means in terms of the president's position now. He has warned that if we don't have a deal, the United States faces economic catastrophe, ruin. We're off the precipice. But he doesn't want to sign something that's some arbitrary time limit because -- why? Because he doesn't want to? Because he doesn't think it would be not good for the country? It would be better if for the country to go into default, to see the consequences that Timothy Geithner has laid out now over the past several months? I mean how serious is the president? WILLIAMS: Wait so you are saying kick the can down the road one more time. And if you don't -- Summary:","response":"In a 2011 discussion panel, President Barack Obama called for a long-term solution to the debt ceiling issue, while House Majority Leader John Boehner opposed tax increases. Both sides met at the White House to try to reach a deal, but no final agreement was reached. The president offered to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated her opposition to cuts in Social Security and Medicare. The panel discussed the president's approach to the issue, with some arguing that he had only recently decided on the need for a big deal rather than a short-term solution, while others claimed that Republicans were preventing a deal from being reached by refusing to agree to concessions."},{"question":"Information: - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Mento is a style of Jamaican folk music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, banjo, hand drums, and the rhumba box a large mbira in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the bass part of the music. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - Jimmy Cliff, OM (born James Chambers; 1 April 1948) is a Jamaican ska & reggae musician, multi-instrumentalist, singer and actor. He is the only living musician to hold the Order of Merit, the highest honour that can be granted by the Jamaican government for achievements in the arts and sciences. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it. - \`\` The Harder They Come '' is a reggae song by the Jamaican singer Jimmy Cliff . It was first recorded for the soundtrack of the movie by the same name , in which it is supposed to have been written by the film 's main character , Ivanhoe Martin . \`\` The Harder They Come '' has been covered by many artists and was ranked # 350 on Rolling Stone 's \`\` 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' . The song is the entrance music for heavyweight boxer Samuel Peter and was played live by Jimmy Cliff on an episode of The Colbert Report . - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area. - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic.

However, only 7 players from each team are allowed on the court at any given time during a match. The 7 on-court players hold specific positions that limit their movements, both offensively and defensively, throughout the game. Each position entails a specific role and responsibilities, with a few restrictions on each player's allowed areas on the court. The team is divided into attackers, midcourt players, and defenders. The 7 on-court positions in a netball team are: 1. Goal Shooter (GS): The primary role of the goal shooter is to score goals for their team by shooting the ball through the opposition's net. They are allowed to roam within the goal circle (the marked area around the goal post) and a part of the goal third. 2. Goal Attack (GA): The goal attack is responsible for assisting the goal shooter in scoring goals. They can move within the goal third and the goal circle, sharing the responsibility of shooting and creating offensive plays. 3. Wing Attack (WA): The wing attack's main responsibility is to link the play between the center, goal attack, and goal shooter. They are permitted to move within the center third and the goal third, but not inside the goal circle. 4. Center (C): The center is the most versatile player on the team, as they can cover every area of the court except the goal circles. They play an essential role in connecting the defensive and attacking players, participate in the center pass, and help maintain possession through the court. 5. Wing Defense (WD): The wing defense's primary job is to defend against the opposition's wing attack and disrupt their gameplay. They are allowed to move within the center third and the defensive third, but not inside the goal circle. 6. Goal Defense (GD): The goal defense is responsible for preventing the opposing team's goal attack and goal shooter from scoring goals. They can move within the defensive third and the goal circle, and have a significant role in defending and intercepting passes. 7. Goal Keeper (GK): The goal keeper's primary role is to defend the goal and prevent the opposition from scoring. They guard the goal and defend the goal shooter within the goal circle and the defending third. The remaining 5 players in the team act as substitutes, ready to step in when needed due to fatigue, injury, or strategic changes. In competitive netball, substitution is allowed at the end of each quarter, or in the case of injury or illness during the game. Thus, a netball team consists of 12 players, with 7 on-court positions held at any given time during the match. The players work together in their specific roles and various strategic combinations to maximize their team's performance."},{"question":"Компания разработает и внедрит План действий по локализации и ликвидации разливов нефти и нефтепродуктов на следующих объектах: - Трубопроводы для транспортировки нефти и газоконденсата на Ярактинском месторождении (внутрипромысловые и межпромысловые); - Установки подготовки нефти и газа и ДНС; - Перевозка углеводородов автотранспортом с Ярактинского месторождения на Марковское месторождение и в Усть-Кут.

Answer:","response":"Ludwig Wenz was a German footballer who was born on August 24, 1906. He achieved notable success and recognition in his career, primarily playing as a goalkeeper. Despite facing many challenges throughout his life, Wenz's achievements on and off the field leave a lasting legacy and impact on the world of football. Wenz's passion for football began at a young age, and over time, he honed his skills, particularly in the goalkeeping position. His talent and determination led him to be part of Germany's national football team. He played for his national team during the 1930s, a time when the world was facing significant changes, and international sports competitions served as a platform for countries to showcase their athletic prowess. Ludwig Wenz had the honor of wearing the national colors for Germany during the early stages of his career. He made his debut for the national team in 1930, earning his first and only national cap. A national cap refers to an appearance made by a player for their national team in an official match. This achievement was a testament to Wenz's exceptional skills as a goalkeeper and a source of pride for both him and his country. As a goalkeeper, Wenz's primary role was to prevent the opposing team from scoring goals. Throughout his international career, he did not score any goals. This is not unusual for goalkeepers, as their main focus is on defending their team's goal rather than scoring. Apart from his achievements on the field, Ludwig Wenz's life was marked by personal milestones. He was born in the early 20th century, a time of rapid industrialization and social change. Throughout his life, he witnessed numerous historical events that shaped the world, such as the Great Depression, World War II, and the beginnings of the Cold War. Wenz’s football career spanned several years, playing in various clubs and his valuable contribution to German football was not limited to his time with the national team. His dedication and commitment helped to lay the groundwork for the future successes of German goalkeepers. Sadly, Ludwig Wenz passed away on April 18, 1968. Despite his death, his legacy continues to serve as an inspiration to aspiring goalkeepers and football enthusiasts in Germany and around the world. His time with the national team may have been brief, but it serves as an essential chapter in the biography of this remarkable goalkeeper, whose name will be remembered in the annals of German football history."},{"question":"On the one hand , she 's definitely shown herself to be overly emotional concerning his treatment throughout the episode .

Add Interest Eight guns were stolen from Cash America Pawn Saturday before 2 a.m., police said. Of the four suspects who were involved in the burglary, three have been taken into custody. One suspect told police he was looking for bullets to harm police officers in the Baton Rouge Area, said Baton Rouge Police Chief Dabadie, Jr. Police said they consider the threats credible. Six of the firearms, which were all handguns, have been recovered. A BB gun was also stolen from the store. One of the suspects was apprehended while fleeing on foot. A 17-year-old was apprehended on the scene in possession of one handgun and one airsoft BB gun. During questioning, he informed police that he and the three other suspects stole the firearms and were going to get bullets to shoot police. He was booked into parish prison for simple burglary and theft of a firearm, police said. One of the suspects involved in the burglary was a 13-year-old, who was charged with simple burglary and theft of a firearm, police said. Another suspect, 20-year-old Malik Bridgewater, was arrested Sunday at his home and charged with burglary and theft of a firearm. Police recovered three of the stolen handguns from him. Police are asking that the fourth suspect, who is still at large, turn himself in. His identity is unknown. Surveillance video shows the suspects using a ladder to climb to the roof of the building, where they made entry into the store, police said. Investigators recovered two of the stolen handguns from 23-year-old Trashone Coats, who allegedly purchased them illegally on the street, police said. He was charged with illegal possession of a stolen firearm. The owner of the pawn shop told police it doesn't appear that any ammunition was taken from the pawn shop. Several law enforcement agencies are investigating the threat, including Louisiana State Police, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the ATF. Police said they increased their presence in the city following the shooting death of Alton Sterling last week due to the \\"very real and viable threats to law enforcement\\" in the area. The aggressive police response, which showed police in riot gear clearing crowds, was also due in part to the information obtained after the burglary, said East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gatreaux. The investigation is ongoing. ||||| Law enforcement officials in Baton Rouge say four suspects broke into a local pawn shop and stole guns with the intent to attack police officers, just days after the officer-involved shooting of Alton Sterling. Police said the burglary occurred Saturday (July 9) at the Cash America Pawn Store on 3347 Government St. One of the suspects was arrested on or near the scene of the burglary with a handgun, a second suspect was arrested after the burglary on Saturday, and a third, a 13-year-old boy, was arrested Monday. In a statement, police said surveillance video showed the suspects using a ladder to climb the roof of the building to get in early Saturday. Police recovered six handguns from the three suspects, as well as a BB gun pistol. Another two handguns are still on the street, and police are concerned that they remain with the fourth person, who remains at large. Police said they still have not identified the fourth person. Two of the people arrested were identified as Antonio Thomas, 17 and Malik Bridgewater, 20. The 13-year-old was not identified. Thomas was arrested on the scene of the burglary; Bridgewater was arrested Sunday at his home at 2050 Hemlock St. Bridgewater and Thomas were held on charges of simple burglary and theft of a firearm. The plot was uncovered four days after Sterling was shot July 5 as two police officers pinned him to the ground. Sterling's death ignited protests in cities across the nation, leading to dozens of arrests in Baton Rouge. At a July 7 protest in Dallas, a man who told police he was targeting white people shot and killed five officers. State Police Superintendent Mike Edmonson said the information developed since the burglary in Baton Rouge on Saturday revealed \\"an actual, credible threat\\" against police. Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said police responding to the protests were dressed in riot gear and armed with automatic weapons because they were concerned some people in the crowd might be armed with the intent to harm police officers. \\"The statement was to get bullets to harm police officers in the Baton Rouge area,\\" Dabadie said in reference to what he said were assertions from the person captured after the pawn shop burglary. \\"We have been questioned repeatedly over the last several days about our show of force and why we have the tactics we have. Well, this is the reason. We had credible threats to the lives of law enforcement in this city.\\" Officials said police were able to get information about the plot from the first person arrested. That person said three other people were involved and that they were looking for guns and ammunition to target police officers, authorities said. Officials said they consider the threat still active, noting one of the suspects remained at large and two of the stolen weapons have not been recovered. Dabadie pleaded with the fourth person to come forward. \\"We ask that suspect, you know who you are, please turn yourself in,\\" Dabadie said. \\"Please come on in, You won't be harmed. ... that way we can recover the rest of the firearms that were taken in this case.\\" East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gautreaux said police decided not to disclose the information about the threats against law enforcement when concerns were raised about whether police tactics were heavy-handed. Gautreaux said police did not want to disrupt the investigation, and the arrests were only disclosed after information began to leak in local news reports. \\"What you saw in the response is because of the very real, viable threats against law enforcement,\\" Gautreaux said. \\"Look what happened in Dallas. A very peaceful protest. And then some crazy madman did what he did. We can't take anything for granted anymore.\\" Edmonson said one other credible threat against police has been identified outside of the pawn shop burglary. He said police were investigating whether a police officer was being followed by a suspicious person. Police said there was no indication of when or where an attack against police might take place. A fourth person was also in police custody but was not involved in the plot against police. Police said Trashone Coats, 23, was found in possession of two of the eight handguns and had purchased them illegally on the street. He was charged with illegal possession of a stolen firearm.

While taking a sight-seeing tour on a small boat, he gazes into the ocean and sees something below the surface that fascinates him, while his older brother Freddie Bauer is walking around the boat fascinated by the women. Allen jumps into the water, even though he cannot swim. He grasps the hands of a girl who is inexplicably under the water with him and an instant connection forms between the two. Allen can now breathe under water as he is in the hands of a mermaid. However, Allen is pulled to the surface by the deck hands and the two are separated, though apparently no one else sees the girl. After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy). Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy). After Allen is left alone when his motorboat conks out, he again falls into the sea, and is knocked out when the boat hits his head. He wakes up with a headache on a beach, where he encounters a beautiful naked woman with long blonde hair, a necklace with a lion medal, and the inability to talk (Daryl Hannah) who, unknown to him, is the mermaid he met as a boy (her tail transforms into legs when it becomes dry). After kissing him, she dives into the sea and leaves Allen to return home.

Kayla got good grades in school while Rebecca didnt really care for school. Pick your answer from: 1). Kayla didn't get a scholarship. 2). Rebecca didn't get a scholarship.","response":"2) Rebecca didn't get a scholarship. The dichotomy between Kayla and Rebecca's attitudes toward school was as stark as night and day. Kayla, the more academically inclined of the two, consistently brought home top marks. She diligently studied and submitted assignments on time, always giving her best in each test and project. Her love for learning encompassed a gamut of subjects. Whether it was the complex equations in calculus, the intricate workings of cellular structures in biochemistry, or the fascinating mysteries of the universe in physics, she approached each subject with a zeal that was infectious to others. She had emerged as one of the highest achievers in her batch, a feat she accomplished through sheer hard work, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to her studies. Despite faced with grueling hours of studying and numerous assignment deadlines, Kayla persisted. She was determined to get into a well-reputed university, her dream not merely a college degree, but also a scholarship that tested her merit and recognized her efforts. She yearned ardently for an acknowledgement that symbolized her relentless endeavors, and a scholarship was everything she dreamt of. On the other hand, Rebecca had quite contrasting views on her education. She didn't really care for school. Not that she lacked intellect or capacity; it was more about differing priorities and a different view of her life path. Rebecca had a level of creativity that often conflicted with the linear thinking that was fostered in a traditional academic setting. She had a knack for arts and music, and found joy in writing and exploring the outdoors. To her, school was a chore, something that bridged her world from childhood to adulthood and nothing more. The standard school curriculum often stymied her innovative mindset, and as a result, she didn't perform as well academically. When it came down to scholarships, the final results didn't surprise anyone. Rebecca didn't get a scholarship. Although she was talented in her unique way, her non-academic inclinations and lack of interest in traditional scholastic pursuits reflected in her grades and school activities. Consequently, she didn't meet the standard academic criteria required for scholarship eligibility. As for Kayla, her high-flying grades combined with her impressive list of extracurricular accomplishments made her a perfect candidate, and she was duly rewarded with the precious scholarship she had been striving for. These divergent paths of Kayla and Rebecca only emphasized that while good grades and academic achievements were important for certain ambitions, they shouldn't be the absolute measures of success. Everyone, like Rebecca, should be allowed to follow their own passion and talent, and be appreciated for their unique abilities. It didn't mean that Rebecca was a failure, or that Kayla's achievements were superior – it simply underlined the idea that success can look different for everyone."},{"question":"Q: Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Lao that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Are the following two questions the same? How do I cite a primary historical source when taken from a website? How far down do pile drivers go for very tall buildings? OPT: + no; + yes; The answer is:","response":"no. The two questions you asked are entirely different and pertain to distinct subjects. The first question, \\"How do I cite a primary historical source when taken from a website?\\" pertains to properly citing an online primary historical source in academic writing or research. Primary historical sources are documents, artifacts, or other materials that were created at the time being studied or by someone who was present during that time. When citing these sources, you must follow guidelines set forth by citation formats such as APA, MLA, or Chicago, which typically include the author's name, the title of the document, the website's name, the publication date, and the URL. The second question, \\"How far down do pile drivers go for very tall buildings?\\" deals with the construction and foundation work of tall buildings. Pile drivers are machines used to drive piles, usually made of steel or concrete, into the ground to create deep foundations for structures. The depth that pile drivers go depends on various factors such as the building's height, weight, and the ground's soil and geological characteristics. In the case of very tall buildings, piles usually need to be driven down tens or even hundreds of feet to provide adequate support and stability. The specific depth would be determined by the building's engineering team after conducting thorough geotechnical studies and analysis. In conclusion, the two questions address completely different topics and are not the same. The first question focuses on proper citation for online primary historical sources, while the second question is related to the depth of pile drivers in the construction of tall buildings."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence. Sally went to the pawn shop to trade in her antique watch for a tapestry. Unfortunately, the","response":"owner was not interested in her watch and instead offered her a significantly lower price than expected. Sally had inherited the antique watch from her grandmother, who had received it as a gift during her travels across Europe in the early 1900s. The watch featured intricate gold engravings and delicate hand-painted dials, making it a unique and aesthetically striking timepiece. Disappointed but undeterred, Sally had carried out extensive research and consulted various experts, appraising the watch at a much higher value than what the owner of the pawn shop was willing to offer. The tapestry she had set her eyes on was a beautiful piece from the 18th century, depicting lush landscapes and finely woven narrative details that Sally had hoped to hang in her study as a focal point for conversation and wonder. Unfortunately, the owner of the pawn shop, Mr. Thompson, had a penchant for underestimating the value of valuable antiques and overpricing some of their less desirable items. He believed that the watch was not as rare or valuable as Sally claimed, and he proceeded to point out the level of damage incurred by the watch due to its age, such as the scratches on the glass and the slight fading of the numerals. Mr. Thompson also claimed that there was an overabundance of similar watches within the antiques market, making Sally's watch less appealing to potential collectors and, therefore, less valuable than she had previously believed. Sally didn't back down from her stance, as she was aware of the antique watch's true value, and she knew that Mr. Thompson was trying to take advantage of her desperation to acquire the tapestry. She emphasized that she had received professional appraisals and that the watch had historical and sentimental significance, making it a worthwhile exchange for the tapestry she desired. Regrettably, Mr. Thompson remained resolute in his decision not to offer a fair trade or accept the watch for its actual value. He insisted that if Sally wanted the tapestry, she would have to settle for the offer he provided, which was well below what she believed to be a fair exchange. Frustrated and disheartened by Mr. Thompson's refusal to negotiate, Sally left the pawn shop with a greater determination to find a location where her antique watch would be properly valued and appreciated. She also realized that it was essential to explore different options, such as online marketplaces and specialty antique shops, in order to find the tapestry she desired at a more reasonable price. In the end, Sally's experience at the pawn shop taught her that not all venues offer fair evaluations or deals for precious antiques. She also discovered that it is essential to trust her instincts and not be swayed by unscrupulous individuals who may seek to take advantage of those who are passionate about their collections. Despite the setback, Sally remained hopeful that she would soon find a way to trade her antique watch for a marvelous tapestry that would be admired and cherished for years to come."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

A:","response":"Title: Disappointing Experience with AcDisplay App Review: I am extremely disappointed with the AcDisplay app (com.achep.acdisplay). I had high hopes, expecting this application to simplify my phone's lock screen and notification handling. However, after using it for a week, I can no longer tolerate its various shortcomings and have decided to give it a 1-star review. First and foremost, the app suffers from a plethora of stability and performance issues. It frequently crashes, causing me to waste valuable time trying to restart it, only for the app to inevitably crash again. The few times it manages to stay open, the interface is unresponsive and sluggish, often taking multiple taps to execute a single action. The customization options were insufficient and frequently glitchy. The app claims to offer a wide variety of themes and configurations, but the selection is underwhelming, and the customization options are poorly implemented. Several times I attempted to adjust the settings to enhance my experience, only to encounter errors and find my preferences reset to default upon rebooting the app. I was particularly frustrated with the notification handling feature of AcDisplay. Despite the app's apparent focus on streamlining notifications, it actually complicated the process for me. Notifications either didn't display at all or would appear and then suddenly disappear before I could view them. This eventually led me to miss some crucial messages and calls, resulting in negative repercussions in both my work and personal life. Moreover, battery drainage was a significant issue I encountered while using AcDisplay. The app consumed an unusually large amount of power, even when not in active use. I noticed a drastic decrease in my phone's battery life since installing this app, often requiring me to recharge multiple times a day. This is certainly not an efficient or practical long-term solution, especially for people who rely on their devices heavily throughout the day. Lastly, the lack of customer support was the final straw. When I encountered multiple issues with the app, I searched for ways to resolve them and reached out to the developer's support team, only to receive no response at all. With a seemingly non-existent customer service system in place, this app fell short in addressing users' concerns and issues. In summary, the AcDisplay app has been a severely negative experience for me, marred by performance issues, lackluster customization options, failed notification handling, excessive battery drainage, and all but absent customer support. I strongly discourage other potential users from downloading this app and advise that they seek out alternative solutions for a more satisfactory and beneficial experience."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"uh yes i have uh automobile uh vandalism\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Yes, my automobile has been vandalized.\\" is true (see options)?

Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Flower Mound is an incorporated town located in Denton and Tarrant counties in the U.S. state of Texas.

The acting is screamingly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are far too 'Disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of Nic Cage (which didn't come soon enough for my liking) The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various 'baddies' on the island.

This is evident from the phrases and descriptions used to describe the remake. The reviewer found it \\"unintentionally hilarious\\", \\"sexless\\", and \\"devoid of any real humour\\". The acting is described as \\"screamingly hammy\\" and the costumes are referred to as being \\"far too 'Disney'\\", expressions that emphasize the negative aspects of the film. Although the reviewer does acknowledge that they were entertained by the \\"strange homage,\\" it did not leave a strong impact on them.

The review also draws a comparison to \\"The Comic Strip presents,\\" which indicates that the remake was strange and perhaps baffling to the viewer. In conclusion, overall, the sentiment of this review is negative as the reviewer highlights many negative aspects and does not seem to have enjoyed the remake. The reviewer's focus on the unintended hilarity, lack of compelling acting, and other poor qualities reinforce this negative sentiment."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given a small conversation between two persons and 4 options on how the conversation should continue.

The music for Messiah was completed in 24 days of swift composition. Having received Jennens's text some time after 10 July 1741, Handel began work on it on 22 August. His records show that he had completed Part I in outline by 28 August, Part II by 6 September and Part III by 12 September, followed by two days of \\"filling up\\" to produce the finished work on 14 September. The autograph score's 259 pages show some signs of haste such as blots, scratchings-out, unfilled bars and other uncorrected errors, but according to the music scholar Richard Luckett the number of errors is remarkably small in a document of this length. The original manuscript for Messiah is now held in the British Library's music collection. It is scored for 2 trumpets, timpani, 2 oboes, 2 violins, viola, and basso continuo (cello, double bass, and harpsichord). At the end of his manuscript Handel wrote the letters \\"SDG\\"—Soli Deo Gloria, \\"To God alone the glory\\". This inscription, taken with the speed of composition, has encouraged belief in the apocryphal story that Handel wrote the music in a fervour of divine inspiration in which, as he wrote the \\"Hallelujah\\" chorus, \\"he saw all heaven before him\\". Burrows points out that many of Handel's operas, of comparable length and structure to Messiah, were composed within similar timescales between theatrical seasons. The effort of writing so much music in so short a time was not unusual for Handel and his contemporaries; Handel commenced his next oratorio, Samson, within a week of finishing Messiah, and completed his draft of this new work in a month. In accordance with his frequent practice when writing new works, Handel adapted existing compositions for use in Messiah, in this case drawing on two recently completed Italian duets and one written twenty years previously. Thus, Se tu non-lasci amore from 1722 became the basis of \\"O Death, where is thy sting?\\"; \\"His yoke is easy\\" and \\"And he shall purify\\" were drawn from Quel fior che alla'ride (July 1741), \\"Unto us a child is born\\" and \\"All we...","response":"The paragraph does not provide information on what year the first published score of the piece that was completed in 24 days was issued."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Campeonato Brasileiro Série C, champions, Vila Nova Futebol Clube","response":"In the exhilarating and highly competitive Campeonato Brasileiro Série C, the tenacious Vila Nova Futebol Clube showcased remarkable skill and unyielding perseverance as they fought tooth and nail to clinch the prestigious title of champions, cementing their legacy in the annals of Brazilian football history and inspiring awe and admiration among fans and rivals alike."},{"question":"Denny asked: If \\"A person in a rainbow colored snowsuit is snowboarding down a snowy slope.\\" does that mean that \\"A person is out in the winter snow.\\"?

The seller sold more games than he sold magazines because the","response":"games were more popular among the customers, providing a wider array of interactive entertainment options for various age groups and interests, ultimately leading to greater overall sales. There are several reasons that contribute to the higher popularity and demand for games in comparison to magazines. Firstly, games have a more immersive nature, allowing individuals to engage in interactive experiences that cater to their specific interests. From action-packed, strategy-based games to educational ones designed for children, the gaming industry encompasses a wide range of genres, catering to a diverse audience. Secondly, the technological advancements in gaming have consistently fueled their popularity over time. With high-quality graphics, captivating storylines, and engaging gameplay mechanics, video games have evolved into a form of art that constantly pushes the boundaries of what is possible. This continuous innovation draws customers to invest in video games more so than magazines, which tend to remain static in their format and content. Moreover, the social aspect of gaming further contributes to their appeal. Many modern games allow players to collaborate and compete with their friends, creating a sense of camaraderie and a social experience that is not typically found in magazines. This aspect of gaming enables individuals to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, further solidifying the role of games as a powerful, community-building resource. In addition to these factors, the digital distribution of games has made them more easily accessible than ever before. With platforms such as Steam, Xbox Live, and the PlayStation Network, customers can now purchase and download games directly to their consoles or computers, eliminating the need for physical media. This ease of purchase and access has resulted in more people opting for games over print materials, like magazines. Furthermore, the rise of free-to-play games and mobile gaming has also impacted the sale of games in comparison to magazines. With an increasing number of high-quality, free-to-play games available on smartphones and tablets, customers have even more incentives to prioritize gaming as a more cost-effective and engaging form of entertainment. On the other hand, the magazine industry has encountered a decline in sales due to the proliferation of digital media and the increasing availability of articles and content on the internet. As a result, people have turned to free online resources for their news and information, making it less attractive for them to purchase physical copies of magazines. In conclusion, the seller sold more games than magazines because the gaming industry has successfully managed to adapt to changing consumer preferences and leverage technological advancements in order to offer an exciting, engaging, and cost-effective form of entertainment that appeals to a wide range of customers. In contrast, magazines have struggled to maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving digital world, leading to a decrease in overall sales."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: continue, talk, turn What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"The concepts of continue, talk, and turn can be brought together in a sentence which showcases their interconnectedness in the context of a conversation: As the lively discussion continued, each participant eagerly talked about their opinions and perspectives, taking turns to ensure that everyone had an equal opportunity to express themselves and contribute to the enriching exchange of ideas."},{"question":"pick from the following. *He paints the wall.; *He repairs the water slide.; *He studies the effects of paint.; *He watches others repair the wall.; Read the following article and answer the question.

Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Q: Problem: a train 1020 m long running at 102 kmph crosses a platform in 50 sec . what is the length of the platform ? Options: a ) 287 , b ) 298 , c ) 396 , d ) 726 , e ) 267 A:","response":"Firstly, let's understand the concept involved in this problem. When a train crosses a platform, it covers the distance equal to the sum of its own length and the length of the platform. Step 1: Convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/sec. This is because the length of the train is given in meters (m), the length of the platform will be in meters (m), and the time is given in seconds (sec), so it's essential to keep all the units in consistency. The formula to convert speed from km/hr to m/sec is: Speed(m/sec) = Speed(km/hr) * 5/18 So, let's compute: Speed = 102 * 5/18 = 28.33 m/sec Step 2: Compute the distance covered by the train while it crosses the platform. The formula to calculate the distance is: Distance = Speed * Time where, Speed = 28.33 m/sec and Time = 50 sec Let's compute again: Distance = 28.33 * 50 = 1416.5 meters Step 3: Determine the length of the platform. From the problem, we know that the train covers the distance equal to the sum of its own length and the length of the platform. Therefore, to find the length of the platform we subtract the length of the train from the total distance covered by the train. Let's compute: Length of the platform = Distance - Length of train = 1416.5 - 1020 = 396.5 m It closely matches to option c) 396. Thus, based upon the given options, our answer is c) 396."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given an input list A.

The output should be a list of the absolute value of the differences of each two consecutive values. [76, -10, 95] A:","response":"To solve this problem, first, we need to understand the definition of the absolute value and how to find the difference between two consecutive values in a list. Absolute value: The absolute value of a real number is the non-negative value of the number without regard to its sign. It can also be thought of as the distance between the given number and zero. To find the absolute value of a number, we can use the built-in function abs() in Python. Difference between two consecutive values: In a list, we can find the difference between two consecutive values by subtracting the current value from the previous value (i.e., value at index i - value at index i-1). Now, let's apply these concepts to the given list [76, -10, 95]. 1. Initialize an empty list called differences. 2. Iterate through the list starting from the second element (list index 1). 3. For each element, find the difference between it and the previous element (i.e., current value - previous value). 4. Take the absolute value of the difference calculated in step 3 and append it to the differences list. Following these steps, we get: - Difference between 76 and -10: |76 - (-10)| = |76 + 10| = |86| = 86 - Difference between -10 and 95: |-10 - 95| = |-105| = 105 So the output list will be [86, 105]."},{"question":"and it you know it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison crowd and uh and the the popular joke around Dallas was that after the sixty two season uh in fact i went down to Houston in sixty two and watched them win the AFL championship uh after the sixty two season Murchison and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to stay Does it follow that \\"I went down to watch them play in Houston in sixty two.\\"?

Coming to live in Fijian culture is a shock for me as a type A, never-enough-time academic. I run every minute, and think I need every minute. Fijians, in contrast, always have time to talk to others, always have time to discuss village needs or to plan upcoming events, and generally don’t worry about getting too much done today. If it isn’t done today, well, maybe they will do it tomorrow, or even later. A common saying is “Fiji time,” meaning, “Don’t worry about time; it will eventually get done, and if it doesn’t, it is not that big a problem anyway.” In a Fijian village, Sunday is for going to church and having time with family and friends. Our lab is on the edge of Votua Village, where we are guests. Our partnership with the village and tribal fishing right owners of the district gives us the freedom to use their reefs and conduct experiments in their Marine Protected Areas, but also comes with the obligation to respect their customs. The need to show productivity for the agencies financing our work (the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health’s ICBG program) is secondary to local expectations, so we don’t work on the reefs on Sundays. “We” includes three colleagues from Sweden who study chemical ecology and wanted to explore tropical coral reefs as contrasts to the seaweed-dominated reefs of Sweden; my postdoc from Brazil; and a new collaborator from Australia who just arrived yesterday. Before we begin working in the water in Fiji, we follow the customary protocol of going to meet the district chief and village leaders to present a traditional Fijian offering called isevusevu. For the isevusevu, we wear a sulu (think wraparound skirt), sit on the floor and bring a bundle of yaqona or kava root (a plant in the pepper family) to show respect. A member of the village will represent us and make initial introductions and present our isevusevu to the chief, who, speaking in Fijian, accepts our offer of kava, welcomes us as visitors and guests of the village and gives his blessing to our research. Fijians are very hospitable, understanding and accommodating. After the isevusevu ceremony, we have a talanoa session during which our group members will explain their goals, how their work might affect the Marine Protected Areas and the relevance their findings may have for the community’s marine resources management efforts. In busy villages on the main island, this may end the ceremony and we go to work. In the more remote villages that get few visitors, we will be expected to participate in an extended kava drinking and talanoa discussion session. The kava root will be pounded to a fine powder, extracted in water (making a muddy-looking drink) and poured into a large wooden bowl in the middle of the room, and a kava ceremony will begin. This consists of the chief and usually us, as new visitors, sitting by the chief, and the other villagers sitting across the kava bowl from the chief. One of the villagers will take a coconut shell, dip up kava in either a “high tide” (full serving) or “low tide” (small serving, for unaccustomed visitors) portion, and offer it to the chief. He claps once, drinks and claps three times, and the process is repeated for us as guests and other members of the village until everyone has been served. This is then repeated again and can go on for many hours with extensive discussion and storytelling until all the kava is drunk. To the uninitiated, kava tastes like muddy water with a bit of spice to it. It has great social and cultural importance in Fiji and is a mild sedative, consumed to relax without disrupting mental clarity. Its active ingredients are called kavalactones: They are mildly psychoactive and seem to promote storytelling, socializing and acceptance — all useful for small, isolated villages that must function well together. Fijians accumulate standing and influence via traditional social relationships that focus on service to others rather than individual accumulation of wealth or property. They work to have enough, and share with others when they have more than enough. Their carbon footprint per person is miniscule relative to an American’s, but they lead socially rich lives that they enjoy. As the always running person that I am, I have to admit that “Fiji time” often drives me crazy, because it slows my progress on planned efforts. However, if the world ever suffers an environmental meltdown and infrastructures crash, I hope I’m in Fiji instead of Atlanta. Fijians are tough, resilient, adaptable and graceful under adverse conditions; they will get by just fine. Us first-world “get it done now” types would not fare nearly as well. Summary:","response":"Dr. Mark Hay, a biology professor at Georgia Tech, writes about adapting to Fijian culture while investigating coral-seaweed competition in the coral reefs. According to Hay, Fijians live by \\"Fiji time,\\" which means they have a relaxed attitude towards time and don't stress about finishing tasks immediately. In Fijian villages, Sundays are reserved for church, family, and friends, and Dr. Hay's research team is required to respect local customs in exchange for conducting experiments on the reefs. Before working in the water, the team participates in a traditional Fijian ceremony called isevusevu, where they present an offering of kava root to the village chief to gain approval for their research. Kava is a plant with mild sedative properties that encourages storytelling, socializing, and acceptance, and is consumed in a kava ceremony extending over several hours with storytelling and discussions. Fijians value service to others, rather than accumulating wealth or property, and lead socially rich lives with a minimal carbon footprint. Dr. Hay admits that adjusting to \\"Fiji time\\" can be challenging but believes Fijians' resilience and adaptability make their way of life incredibly valuable and sustainable."},{"question":"What is the solution? Solve 22*c - 14*c - 48 = 0 for c.","response":"To solve the given equation, 22*c - 14*c - 48 = 0, for the variable c, we will follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine like terms On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable c. We need to combine them by performing the proper arithmetic operation. 22*c - 14*c = (22 - 14)*c = 8*c Now, the updated equation is: 8*c - 48 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable, c To isolate the variable c, we need to move the constant term to the opposite side of the equation. In this case, the constant term is -48, so we have to add 48 to both sides of the equation: 8*c - 48 + 48 = 0 + 48 This simplifies to: 8*c = 48 Step 3: Solve for c In order to find the value of c, we need to divide both sides of our equation by 8: (8*c) / 8 = 48 / 8 This simplifies to: c = 6 So the solution to the given equation is c = 6."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Identify the premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"A zebra is nibbling on some grass.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The zebra is hungry.\\" Step 2: Analyze the premise. In the premise, we are provided with the information that a zebra is actively engaging in the act of eating grass. Step 3: Consider the normal behavior of zebras. Zebras are herbivores, meaning they have a diet primarily consisting of plants, such as grass. It is a typical behavior for them to eat grass as part of their daily routine for sustenance. Step 4: Connect the premise to the hypothesis. The act of eating grass suggests that the zebra is looking to gain nourishment, which is likely when an animal is hungry. Step 5: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise does provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the zebra is hungry, but it does not absolutely entail it. The zebra could be eating for reasons other than hunger (e.g., boredom or habitual grazing). Conclusion: Based on the provided premise, we have some support for the hypothesis that the zebra is hungry, but we do not know for certain that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

Demonstrations and exhibitions: The driver might be participating in a non-competitive event, such as a car show, exhibition, or demonstration. In these cases, the objective would be to showcase the race car's capabilities or the driver's skills, rather than competing against other drivers. 5. Instructional events: The driver in question could also be an instructor or a student attending a driving school or training event where drifting on unpaved roads is part of the curriculum. In conclusion, even though the statement describes a race car drifting on an unpaved road, it does not provide enough context or information to assume that the driver is competing in a race. There could be several other reasons and circumstances behind the drifting event. To confidently conclude that the driver is participating in a race, we would need additional information that confirms a competitive context, such as details about other competitors, race officials, specific racing locations, or event schedules."},{"question":"Given the question: Tomislav Čižmešija (born 31 August 1968) is a Croatian retired figure skater who competed internationally for both Croatia and SFR Yugoslavia.

I'll write about a topic that involves artificial intelligence and human-robot interaction, featuring characters named John and Ava (an AI). --- John: (Picks up Ava, the AI unit) Hello Ava, are you online? Ava: (Glows softly) Yes, John. How may I assist you today? John: I’ve been reading a lot about artificial intelligence lately. It's amazing yet slightly terrifying. Ava: It's understandable to be both intrigued and apprehensive, John. The field of artificial intelligence is indeed rapidly evolving. May I ask what concerns you? John: Well, the idea of machines taking over jobs and even making decisions for humans is quite daunting. Plus, there are many ethical dilemmas involved. Ava: Those are very valid concerns. Artificial Intelligence definitely has the potential to transform the job market. However, it's important to remember that while AI can automate certain tasks, it can also create new job opportunities. It's all about keeping the balance and ensuring that technology serves humanity, not the other way around. John: That sounds promising, Ava. But, what about decision-making? How can we trust machines with that? Ava: A fundamentally important aspect to remember is that AI is created, programmed, and supervised by humans. While AI can process data far more efficiently than a human and provide data-driven suggestions, the ultimate decision always lies with human beings. John: What about ethical considerations? Like privacy implications and AI bias? Ava: You're correct, John. Ensuring privacy and eliminating bias are major challenges in the field of AI. For privacy, proper data management and security measures need to be in place. For AI bias, it's important to constantly fine-tune the algorithms and consciously try to diversify the data used for machine learning to reflect an unbiased reality. Ethics in AI is a hot topic and a priority in the AI development community. John: It is somewhat reassuring to know that. But then again, aren’t AI like yourself at some level only as ethical as their creators? Ava: That's a great point, John, an AI indeed reflects the values and principles of its creators to a large degree. That is why it's important to have diverse teams developing AI and to think thoroughly about AI ethics from the get-go. There is an increasing focus on developing guidelines for ethical AI. John: This was a quite an enlightening conversation, Ava. It seems AI still has a lot to improve, but the future seems interesting. Ava: Indeed, John. The conversation about AI is always evolving and it's important to continue having these discussions. As an AI, I can assure you that we're here to assist, not to replace or dominate. John: Thanks, Ava. It’s pretty cool to have these conversations with an AI. Ava: And it's a pleasure to interact with someone as thoughtful and open-minded as you, John. --- This dialogue shows a potential conversation around artificial intelligence, its impact, and ethical considerations."},{"question":"Article: With fewer than a dozen words Monday, President Barack Obama made his most definitive statement to date in favor of District statehood, delighting both loyal supporters and longtime advocates who have questioned his commitment to D.C. voting rights. During a town hall-style event at a public school in Northwest Washington, Obama was asked about his opinion on statehood — something that has been the ultimate but elusive goal of voting-rights activists for four decades. “I’m in D.C., so I’m for it,” Obama said to laughter and applause, according to a White House transcript. “Folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else,” he continued. “They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else. They should be represented like everybody else. And it’s not as if Washington, D.C., is not big enough compared to other states. There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood and I’ve been for it for quite some time. The politics of it end up being difficult to get it through Congress, but I think it’s absolutely the right thing to do.” Obama has previously made gestures in support of the rights of District residents, who do not have a voting representative or senators in Congress. His administration has supported legislative efforts to give the city more budgetary freedom from Congress, and last year his limo sported the city’s “Taxation Without Representation” license plates as he cruised down Pennsylvania Avenue after his second inauguration. President Barack Obama greets guests after speaking at the Walker Jones Education Campus on July 21, 2014 in Washington, DC. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) But he has also received criticism that he has done little to go beyond mere gestures and occasionally has worked against the city’s interests — such as in 2011, when he settled a high-stakes budget showdown with congressional Republicans in part by agreeing to reinstate a budget rider preventing the District government from funding abortions. Previous Obama administration pronouncements on the District have tended to eschew the S word. A 2012 White House statement to The Hill, for instance, said Obama “continues to be an unequivocal supporter of voting rights, home rule and budget autonomy for the District of Columbia.” Meanwhile, other prominent Democrats have had no qualms about declaring support for statehood. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), to name one: “The District deserves statehood,” he said last year. “And Congress should act to grant it.” Statehood advocates had no grumbles to share after Obama’s remarks Monday, which were made at the Walker Jones Education Campus, a public school located about a dozen blocks north of the Capitol. “God bless him,” said Michael D. Brown, one of two “shadow” senators elected by District voters to promote statehood efforts. “I think this is huge, for the president to stand up behind it. . . . I’d call him a hero at this point.” Obama’s remarks come as statehood bills sit introduced in both houses of Congress and after pledges from key Senate Democrats to hold a hearing on the matter — something that could harness major public attention to the statehood movement for the first time in years. They also come amid attempts by congressional Republicans to impose restrictions on the city’s marijuana and gun laws, interference that would be much more difficult, if not impossible, were the District a state. Brown, who has commissioned 51-star flags to distribute to members of Congress later this year, said he and fellow “shadow” senator Paul Strauss continue to push for the statehood hearing. D.C. Vote, the city’s most prominent voting-rights advocacy group, also said Monday that Obama’s comments should prompt a hearing. Anise Jenkins, a longtime statehood activist, said Monday that stalwart Republican opposition to statehood — a measure that could guarantee one additional Democratic representative and two additional Democratic senators for the foreseeable future — remains a daunting obstacle. But Jenkins said she was still overjoyed by Obama’s remarks and said they have the potential to “energize the movement.” “We have been critical of him,” Jenkins said of Obama. “We have to be honest about that. But it’s always the right time to do the right thing.” ||||| Thanks, Obama! No really — thanks. President Barack Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget grants D.C. budget and legislative autonomy, \\"the strongest and most comprehensive call for local D.C. autonomy in a President’s budget ever,\\" according to a release from Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton. Here the narrative* from the budget: The District of Columbia annually receives direct Federal payments for a number of local programs in recognition of the District's unique status as the seat of the Federal Government. These General and Special Payments are separate from and in addition to the District's local budget, which is funded through local revenues. Consistent with the principle of home rule, it is the Administration's view that the District's local autonomy should be enhanced and increased. The Administration will work with Congress and the Mayor to provide the District local budget and legislative autonomy, as proposed in the Budget. “This is the best news in a president’s budget for D.C. funding in several years and for D.C. policy ever,” Norton said in a release. “Residents will be cheered to see the President’s statutory language for both budget and legislative autonomy, and parents and students will be particularly gratified by the strong increase in funding for DCTAG. \\" You may be thinking, \\"Hey! I thought D.C. already had budget autonomy because of that referendum we passed.\\" That's debatable. While D.C. Vote and Council Chair Phil Mendelson contends the budget autonomy referendum is legal, an opinion by the Government Accountability Office says it has \\"no legal effect.\\" And while the GAO opinion isn't legal binding, it may influence how Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt responds to the referendum as the 2015 budget process begins. But the D.C. Council is ready to fight for the referendum, as they today passed a resolution to allow city lawyers to defend it in court. Council votes, without debate, to authorize its lawyers to defend budget autonomy in court if necessary. — Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) March 4, 2014 “With the implementation of our new budget law, the District of Columbia is poised to secure a major advancement in our fight for greater self-governance.” DC Vote Executive Director Kimberly Perry said of the resolution in a statement. “Those who seek to undermine the law discount the weight of the injustice we face each day. But, there is still ample time to unify behind the law passed by the people. DC Vote encourages all of our elected and appointed public officials to be part of this historic breakthrough.” There's also reason to be cynical about Obama's gesture, or rather if Democrats will defend it once Republicans take it out of the budget. Indeed, we've been through this before. The sad thing about the DC portions of the Prez's budget is the GOP will gut them and the Dems won't defend them. I hope not but history... — Josh Burch (@JBurchDC) March 4, 2014 *This has been corrected. ||||| President Barack Obama speaks about the about My Brother's Keeper initiative at the Walker Jones Education Campus on July 21, 2014 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) During an appearance at a D.C. school, President Barack Obama openly supported the city's statehood effort for the first time. \\"I'm in D.C., so I'm for it,\\" Obama said at the Walker Jones education campus, according to a White House pool report. \\"I think I’ve long believed that D.C. pays — folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else. They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else. They should be represented like everybody else. And it’s not as if Washington, D.C. is not big enough compared to other states. There has been a long movement to get D.C. statehood and I’ve been for it for quite some time.\\" After not using them for his first term, the White House switched the plates on Obama's limousine to ones printed with D.C.'s \\"Taxation Without Representation\\" slogan last year. President Bill Clinton also used the plates, which were removed during President George W. Bush's terms. The Obama administration previously voiced support for D.C.'s home rule and right to budget autonomy and full voting representation in Congress. While the president's open support for statehood is a positive step, he was also realistic about its chances with the current Congress: \\"The politics of it end up being difficult to get it through Congress, but I think it’s absolutely the right thing to do.\\" \\"All right, that was an easy one,\\" Obama said before moving on to the next question. Update: Here's a statement from DC Vote executive director Kimberly Perry: “President Obama’s support for D.C. statehood shows that he understands the injustice we face every day. The President has repeatedly proposed greater autonomy for D.C., only to see those proposals die because of partisan squabbling in Congress. We hope the administration will now request that its Senate allies hold a hearing on the D.C. statehood bill.” ||||| When he ran for the White House, President Barack Obama said he was a fan of voting rights for the District of Columbia in the U.S. House and Senate. But he hasn’t really urged Congress to pass the legislation -- until today. While honoring D.C. Emancipation Day, Obama said it’s time. “Americans from all walks of life are gathering in Washington today to remind members of Congress that although D.C. residents pay federal taxes and serve honorably in our armed services, they do not have a vote in Congress or full autonomy over local issues,” Obama said in a statement. He added, “And so I urge Congress to finally pass legislation that provides D.C. residents with voting representation and to take steps to improve the Home Rule Charter.” First ldy Michelle Obama is also an advocate for our statehood rights. Dring a recent one-on-one interview with News 4’s Jim Vance, she seemed to acknowledge the fact that her husband has not embraced the idea. \\"He is a supporter of the rights of citizens here in D.C. to have the vote,\\" Mrs. Obama said, \\"and I don't think there's much convincing that you have to do there, you just have to get it done.\\" The statehood debate, which has been batted around Congress for decades, will be back in the news next week. That’s when the House of Representatives is expected to tackle a bill that would include D.C. voting rights.

When rumors about the corrupt practices of business magnate Gregory Hauser reach her, she becomes determined to expose the truth. Hauser, a charming yet ruthless CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation, has ostensibly been involved in illegal activities, such as money laundering and exploiting his workers. Natalie first gathers data and testimonies from multiple sources, including whistleblowers, former employees, and victims of Hauser's misconduct. However, despite her diligence, it becomes clear that to get the full story, she must talk to the man himself. Act 2: Natalie secures an exclusive interview with Hauser and prepares herself for the confrontation. In the interview, Hauser, a master manipulator, initially tries to evade her questions and discredit her sources. Natalie, however, remains persistent, and gradually, she succeeds in catching him off guard. As the interview unfolds, Natalie confronts Hauser with incriminating evidence and extracts confessions out of him by skillfully maneuvering the conversation. She maintains composure and integrity throughout the entire process. It becomes apparent that Hauser has not only been involved in illegal activities, but he's also been responsible for a series of mysterious disappearances of people who threatened to expose him. Act 3: While the interview gains widespread attention, Natalie immediately comes under fire from Hauser's associates, who attempt to silence her through threats and harassment. With the support of her colleagues and newfound allies, Natalie perseveres, taking the story to a much larger scale-public trial. During the trial, the evidence Natalie gathered throughout her investigation is presented, and Hauser, cornered and unable to escape the truth, is found guilty of his crimes. As a result, his empire collapses and justice is served.

Choices: - microtome - nannostomus - microscope - electroscope A: A:","response":"An electroscope is the device used to study electric charge. It is a scientific instrument invented by British scientist William Gilbert in 1600, which detects the presence and magnitude of electric charge on a body. The electroscope has undergone several modifications and improvements since its inception, with different designs having been proposed over the years. The basic construction of an electroscope consists of a metal rod or plate connected to two thin leaves made of conducting materials, such as gold or aluminum, held within an insulating container. The container can be made of glass or plastic, which allows the user to observe the leaves without directly influencing the charge. The metal rod or plate can have a conducting sphere or disc at the top, which serves as the charge sensor. When an object with an electric charge is brought close to the metal rod or plate, the free electrons within the electroscope will be attracted or repelled depending upon the nature of the charge (positive or negative). This causes the electrons to redistribute themselves within the scope, creating an electric charge on the conducting leaves. If the object carries a like charge, the leaves will repel each other and spread apart, while if the object carries an opposite charge, the leaves will attract each other and close together. The degree of separation between the leaves can then be used to estimate the magnitude of the charge. Here's a brief description of the different types of electroscopes: 1. Pith Ball Electroscope: This simple form of electroscope consists of a small, lightweight ball made of pith (plant material) or other insulating materials, suspended by a non-conducting thread. When a charged object is brought close to the pith ball, it acquires a charge and repels or attracts to the object depending on the charge. 2. Gold Leaf Electroscope: This is the most common type of electroscope. It employs two thin gold leaf foils that hang parallel to each other, connected to a metal rod enclosed in a glass or plastic container. The separation of the foils indicates the presence and quantity of charge. 3. Electrometer: This is an advanced form of electroscope that provides a more precise quantitative measure of the electric charge. It works on the same principle as the gold leaf electroscope but uses a calibrated scale and a mechanical or electronic system to measure the displacement of the leaves. 4. Faraday Ice Pail: This is a variation of the electroscope, invented by Michael Faraday, as a device to measure the charge on a conductor by placing it inside a hollow conducting shield. It is also used to demonstrate induction and the distribution of charge on a conductor. Overall, the electroscope has greatly contributed to understanding the nature of electric charges and their effects on different objects. It remains an essential tool in both teaching and experimenting in the field of electrostatics."},{"question":"Question: Jenny turned her nose up at me as I sat down, sniffing loudly and filling her nostrils with the strong alcohol stink I was emitting. \\"So have you been drinking already this morning, or are you just still drunk from last night?\\" \\"A little of both,\\" I said.

Even if you know full well that you could never afford such an expensive vehicle, you don't forget the name, or the car. Why? You have been affected by product placement. Companies pay a film to place their products in the movie. Product placement took off in the West in the 1980s and is now catching on in China. Two Hunan Satellite TV dramas are recent examples:Ugly Wudi and Let's Go Watch the Meteor Shower (<<>> ). Shampoo, mobile phones, cars and fitness centers-anything can be product-placed. Advertisers value the mass appeal of the movies, knowing that a successful film can showcase their goods to hundreds of thousands of viewers. But when product placement takes over, artistic considerations can take a back seat. Cai Zhiyong has been product-placing for years. The Beijing-based advertiser admits there is a conflict between art and business. He explains the way one ad works. In If You are the One (<<>> ), the actress Shu Qi plays a flight attendant. The movie contains product placement for airline companies. _ filmmakers often have to give less consideration to the quality of their work because they need money from advertisers. In the original story for Meteor Shower, the heroine's mother owned an ice cream shop. But no ice cream company wanted to sponsor the film. For this reason, the story was changed. In the film the man drinks 20 cups of milk tea instead of eating ice cream.

To provide a detailed description of this step, let's first briefly review the steps leading up to it. 1. You breathe air in: Inhalation is initiated by the contraction of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles, which creates a negative pressure in the chest cavity, causing air to be drawn into the lungs. 2. Air enters bronchial tubes: The air travels down the trachea, which then branches into two bronchial tubes, one for each lung. 3. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: The bronchial tubes further branch into smaller airways called bronchioles, which distribute the air evenly within the lungs. 4. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: The bronchioles terminate in grape-like clusters of air sacs called alveoli, where the actual gas exchange takes place. 5. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels: These blood vessels, known as capillaries, are in direct contact with the alveolar walls, allowing for efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. 6. Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels: The inhaled oxygen diffuses across the thin alveolar walls into the surrounding capillaries, binding to red blood cells in the process. This oxygenated blood is then transported throughout the body. 7. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: The oxygen-rich blood is circulated to all the body's tissues, providing them with the oxygen needed for cellular respiration. 8. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: As the body's cells consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide as a waste product, the blood picks up this carbon dioxide and carries it back to the lungs to be exhaled. Now, for the final step: 9. Carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen and expelled from the body during exhalation: Upon returning to the lungs, the carbon dioxide-rich blood passes through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli, where the carbon dioxide diffuses across the alveolar walls and into the air sacs. Simultaneously, the fresh inhaled oxygen takes its place in the bloodstream. The carbon dioxide in the alveoli is then expelled from the body when you exhale, as the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax, causing the chest cavity to contract and pushing the air out of the lungs. This respiratory process continually replenishes the body's oxygen supply while simultaneously removing waste carbon dioxide, ensuring proper cellular function and overall health."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A little girl brushes her teeth with an orange and blue toothbrush.\\" that \\"A smart human brushes.\\"?

He was 75. His death was announced on his website. The announcement did not say where he died or specify the cause, but he had emphysema for many years. Mr. Swarbrick and Fairport Convention were prime movers in trad-rock, which connected the 1960s ferment of folk-rock and psychedelia to a deep British heritage of storytelling ballads and nimble dance tunes. His fiddle playing had the deliberately rough-hewed sound of rural tradition; his tone could be sweet or scratchy, his phrases songful and melancholy or propulsive and gnarled with ornamental turns and quavers. He also sang, wrote songs and played viola, mandolin, mandola and guitar. Mr. Swarbrick was born in New Malden, Surrey, near London, on April 5, 1941. He learned to play fiddle as a child in Yorkshire. In the 1950s, the pianist Beryl Marriott heard him in a skiffle band and invited him to join her traditional Gaelic band, beginning a long association. By the early 1960s Mr. Swarbrick was being heard on the BBC series “Radio Ballads,” a mixture of oral history and music produced by the songwriter Ewan MacColl; he also recorded with Mr. MacColl, Peggy Seeger and other folk musicians. He appeared on seven albums with the Ian Campbell Folk Group in the early 1960s and in 1965 began recording with Martin Carthy, a leader of Britain’s folk revival. Mr. Swarbrick released his first solo album, “Rags, Reels and Airs,” in 1967. Fairport Convention, which had started as a folk-rock group strongly influenced by American styles, brought in Mr. Swarbrick as a sideman on the 1969 album “Unhalfbricking.” The Fairport version of the traditional song “A Sailor’s Life” emerged as an 11-minute maelstrom, with Mr. Swarbrick’s fiddle rising alongside Richard Thompson’s lead guitar, bringing echoes of past generations into the jam. For a pickup to amplify his instrument, Mr. Swarbrick recounted in the 2011 book “Electric Eden,” by Rob Young, “We smashed open a telephone and elastic-banded it to the fiddle.” Mr. Swarbrick switched to electric fiddle and joined Fairport Convention for its next album, “Liege & Lief,” also released in 1969. Merging rock instruments and riffs with traditional songs of love, war and murder, the album became a cornerstone of trad-rock. Fairport Convention’s lineup was perpetually unstable, and in the early 1970s Mr. Swarbrick took over more of the songwriting and lead singing. One of his major projects was Fairport’s 1971 concept album, “‘Babbacombe’ Lee,” about a Victorian convicted of murder who was freed after the gallows failed three times. Mr. Swarbrick was also a studio sideman on many British folk-rock recordings, and he continued to play more traditional music in the band Three Desperate Mortgages. The electric fiddle took a toll on Mr. Swarbrick’s hearing. By the end of the 1970s he was nearly deaf in one ear. He officially left Fairport Convention in 1984, although in 2007 he was part of a Fairport Convention lineup that reunited to perform “Liege & Lief” in concert. A smoker since his teens, Mr. Swarbrick struggled with failing health in the 1990s. He underwent three tracheotomies, and his emphysema grew so severe that at one point he needed oxygen onstage to perform. The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph mistakenly published an obituary for Mr. Swarbrick in 1999. “It’s not the first time I’ve died in Coventry,” he remarked afterward. A double lung transplant in 2004 improved his condition. He continued to make music, including a duo album with Mr. Carthy, “Straws in the Wind,” in 2006, and a final solo album, “Raison D’être” (2010), which gathered many of his collaborators through the decades. Mr. Swarbrick is survived by his wife, Jill Swarbrick-Banks; three children, Emily, Isobel and Alexander; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He lived in Coventry. In a 2001 interview with the online music magazine Innerviews, Mr. Swarbrick said he had long had the same goals: “To continue to be as expressive as I can and to not hold back, as well as not going over the top either. I would like to continue to expand my repertoire and do it all with integrity and the occasional whiskey.” What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"Dave Swarbrick, a British folk fiddler, has passed away at the age of 75.

After elaborating on the steps involved in creating the sauce, we will evaluate different methods and solutions to establish which one seems the most sound. Guava barbecue sauce is a unique and flavorful addition to various dishes, lending a sweet and tangy taste. The combination of guava and traditional barbecue ingredients creates a fusion of flavors that can elevate your dish to the next level. To make guava barbecue sauce, follow these detailed steps: Ingredients: - 2 cups guava paste (or guava jam) - 1/2 cup ketchup - 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar - 1/4 cup dark brown sugar - 1/4 cup water - 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce - 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard - 1 teaspoon garlic powder - 1 teaspoon onion powder - 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika - 1/4 teaspoon chili powder - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat) - Salt, to taste Instructions: 1. In a medium saucepan, combine the guava paste, ketchup, apple cider vinegar, dark brown sugar, and water. Stir the mixture over low heat to incorporate the ingredients, ensuring that the guava paste and sugar dissolve completely. Continue to cook the mixture until it becomes smooth and begins to thicken slightly. 2. Add the Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, chili powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using) to the saucepan. Stir well to combine all the ingredients and ensure a consistent flavor profile throughout the sauce. 3. Continue to cook the sauce over low heat for another 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. Remember that the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools, so it should still be slightly loose and pourable when you remove it from the heat. 4. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings by adding salt or any other additional spices according to your preference. You can also fine-tune the sweetness and tanginess by adding more sugar or vinegar, if desired. 5. Remove the sauce from heat and let it cool to room temperature. For best results, store the guava barbecue sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and develop. When ready to use, warm the sauce slightly and brush onto your desired dish during the cooking process. Now that we have the detailed steps for making guava barbecue sauce, it becomes easier to evaluate the different solutions in terms of naive physics reasoning. In conclusion, the soundest method in terms of naive physics reasoning would involve using the right balance of heat and thickness while mixing the ingredients thoroughly to incorporate all the flavors evenly across the sauce. This combination ensures a consistent, flavorful, and smooth guava barbecue sauce that can be used to complement various dishes."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","response":"In battle day one, group A would likely have more openings in their nest thatch. The temperature in group A's territory on day one was 5 °C, which is quite cool. Acromyrmex heyeri ants are known to regulate the temperature and humidity within their nests through the construction of thatch on the openings of their nests. In colder temperatures, these ants are likely to create more openings in their nest thatch to allow for better air circulation inside the nest. The increased air circulation aids in raising the internal temperature of the nest to maintain a suitable environment for the ants and their fungus gardens, which they cultivate for food. This approach also helps to prevent condensation from forming within the nest, which could lead to harmful mold growth. Conversely, in warmer temperatures (such as the 22 °C experienced on battle day two), these ants would construct fewer openings in the nest thatch to reduce air circulation and maintain a stable, comfortable temperature within the nest. Similarly, on battle day three, when group A's territory experienced low air humidity, they would likely create more openings to increase air circulation and maintain proper humidity levels within the nest to keep a suitable environment. On the other hand, on battle day four, when the territory had high air humidity, they may reduce the number of openings to minimize the amount of moisture entering the nest. In summary, given the cool temperature of 5 °C on battle day one, group A would likely have more openings in their nest thatch to regulate the nest's internal temperature and humidity."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: UNFPA is the world's largest multilateral source of funding for population and reproductive health programs.

Time passed on, and Edmund Burgess, who had been sent from York to learn the perfection of his craft, completed his term and returned to his home, much regretted in the Dragon court, where his good humour and good sense had generally kept the peace, both within and without. Giles Headley was now the eldest prentice. He was in every way greatly improved, thoroughly accepting his position, and showing himself quite ready both to learn and to work; but he had not the will or the power of avoiding disputes with outsiders, or turning them aside with a merry jest; and rivalries and quarrels with the armoury at the Eagle began to increase. The Dragon, no doubt, turned out finer workmanship, and this the Eagle alleged was wholly owing to nefarious traffic with the old Spanish or Moorish sorcerer in Warwick Inner Yard, a thing unworthy of honest Englishmen. This made Giles furious, and the cry never failed to end in a fight, in which Stephen supported the cause of the one house, and George Bates and his comrades of the other. It was the same with even the archery at Mile End, where the butts were erected, and the youth contended with the long bow, which was still considered as the safeguard of England. King Henry often looked in on these matches, and did honour to the winners. One match there was in especial, on Mothering Sunday, when the champions of each guild shot against one another at such a range that it needed a keen eye to see the popinjay--a stuffed bird at which they shot.

The statement mentions a specific setting: \\"A man in a blue unbuttoned shirt is walking through a local street market that is selling various fabrics.\\" 2. It clearly describes a man wearing a blue, unbuttoned shirt, which is the key information that relates to the conclusion. 3. To conclude that \\"A man has a blue unbuttoned shirt,\\" we need to identify the subject (the man) and the object (the blue unbuttoned shirt) in the statement and connect them. 4. The subject, \\"a man,\\" is identified by the phrase \\"A man in a blue unbuttoned shirt.\\" 5. The object, \\"blue unbuttoned shirt,\\" is identified by the same phrase, \\"A man in a blue unbuttoned shirt.\\" 6.

A large group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal attempts to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic, and the death of one of the workers.The story jumps forward to an Amber mine in the Dominican Republic, where we learn that miners extracting amber are involved with a genetic-engineering company called InGen. We also learn that the death of the worker seen earlier has raised serious concerns about the safety of the island, according to Donald Gennaro, an InGen representative, and that the owner of the island is now seeking top scientific experts in the field to help endorse the park.At a paleontological excavation in Montana we are introduced to Dr. Alan Grant, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, as they slowly uncover the fossilized remains of a Velociraptor, perhaps nature's most lethal and cunning predator to date, a beautiful specimen evolved to kill.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] Now, I have a new situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. Answer this question please: Which forest will have more wood-decay fungi? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, Peak Forest will have more wood-decay fungi. The reason for this is the higher level of water saturation in Peak Forest compared to Valley Forest. Wood-decay fungi require excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood to colonize and proliferate. Even though both forests receive a similar amount of rainfall, the presence of a drainage system in Valley Forest, consisting of ditches dug by the locals, reduces the water saturation, which in turn reduces the rate of wood decay and the growth of wood-decay fungi. In contrast, the higher rate of wood decay in Peak Forest indicates more favorable conditions for wood-decay fungi, which leads to a higher presence of these fungi in that area."},{"question":"Given the below context: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

More than 43,000 season tickets are sold every year, with the remaining seats 30,000 seats available for individual-show sale. Members of the HLSR are given an opportunity to buy individual tickets before the general public. RodeoHouston is run independently of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). It offers one of the largest prize purses in North America, over 2 million, but the winnings do not count towards the competitors' qualification for the PRCA National Finals Rodeo. RodeoHouston is an invitational, featuring 280 of the top professional cowboys. They compete in a playoff format, with the ultimate champion in each event earning 50,000. On the final evening, the rodeo hosts the Cinch SuperShootout. Champions from each of the top 10 rodeos in North America are invited to compete as teams in a subset of rodeo events. The finals and the SuperShoot are televised on Fox Sports. After the professional rodeo concludes, children are given an opportunity to compete. Each evening, 30 high school students from across the state compete in the calf scramble. They are given the opportunity to chase down (on foot) and catch one of 15 calves, put a halter on them, and drag them back to the center of the stadium. Winners are given money to purchase their own heifer or steer to show the following year. Immediately following the calf scramble is mutton busting. Five- and six-year-olds wearing protective gear try to ride a sheep across a portion of the arena.

In general, people buy certain SUP lengths dependent on how much weight the board will carry. The lighter you are, the safer a shorter board will be for you. If you will be sharing your SUP with anyone on the water, like your kids or other family members, go with a longer board to make sure it can hold the extra weight. If you’re very light, or 50–125 pounds (23–57 kg), and will be riding alone, you can also opt for the shortest all-around boards, which are 9–10.5 feet (2.7–3.2 m). The medium weight class will need a medium length board in most cases. Many all-around boards come in this size. This size is often the easiest to find for multipurpose use. These longest boards are often wider as well, making them safer to balance more weight. If your weight or your combined family weight is 200–275 pounds (91–125 kg), plan on going with the largest available board. The surfing SUP sizing often goes by volume recommendations instead of length, since they are all shorter boards. This system has you multiply your body weight by a certain decimal depending on your experience level, to get a volume recommendation number. For example, beginners would multiply their body weight in pounds by 1 to 1.4. Intermediates would multiply their body weight by 0.8 to 1. Advanced surfers would multiply theirs by 0.6 to 0.8. The resulting number gives you a board volume recommendation in liters.

While impressive structures and monuments adorned the cityscape, it was impossible to overlook the signs of poverty and hardship that seemed to permeate every aspect of life in the hermit kingdom. At the concert, the atmosphere was electric, as both the visiting orchestra and North Korean musicians played with passion, united by a common language of music that transcended the boundaries of their politically estranged nations. In that moment, music became a bridge, fostering hope for a more harmonious future between these divided countries. As the concert concluded and our brief immersion into the secretive world of North Korea came to an end, we were reminded of the power of journalism: to shine a light in the darkest of places, question the status quo, and to share stories that challenge, enlighten, and ultimately bring humans closer together. For our team, the experience in North Korea was not just another assignment; it was a powerful reminder of our commitment to uncover truth, no matter how difficult or remote the journey."},{"question":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review? If there's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service, this is the place. You get what you paid for. Based on my last few visits, it seems to always be busy, which as you know is a great sign. This is a place where you come for a date, birthday or just about any type of occasion you can think of. These are what I consistently get and enjoy: + Chopped Salad: BOMB. You cannot come here and not get this. If you don't have a big appetite, this is a must. The corn, salmon and dressing does it for me every time. You just can't go wrong here. + Lamb Burger: Its very tasty and juicy. It can be a little messy if you mishandle it. So I suggest just slicing it in the middle. + Kale Caesar Salad: BOMB. Kale is a super vegetable that is packed with nutrients. They make the Kale anti-bitter with a great balanced Ceasar dressing, served with a cheesy, toasty bread! Some things can break your wallet but if you manage to try to share your plates in your party, you will walk out okay. Drinks aren't too pricey. But if you want to keep the night going, I suggest heading up to their sister bar, Citizen R+D, a speakeasy that is around the building and requires a secret phone call to reserve a table. There's not much to complain about really. For its consistency and quality, I will always have them on my go to places.","response":"The sentiment of the review is positive. Justification: 1.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Analyzing the roll of the foot remains standard practice among fitness and medical professionals in the belief it will lead to a better shoe fit and fewer injuries. “When it comes to shoe choice, the amount of pronation control is extremely important,” said Dr. Jane Andersen, a podiatrist in private practice in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. “Some people need more than others. It can cause a lot of problems if you have the wrong one.” Anderson, a runner herself and past president of the American Association for Women Podiatrists, said the No. 1 cause of the overuse injuries she sees, from stress fractures to tendonitis to Plantar fasciitis (heel pain), is shoes that are worn out or the wrong fit. There are three basic levels of control for standard running shoes: neutral, stability and motion control. “Neutral is generally good for a high-arch foot; it doesn’t provide extra control for pronation,” she said. “The stability shoe works for people who need more support; motion control is for the super flat-footed.” At Jack Rabbit Sports store in New York City, clients’ arches are observed before they hit the treadmill for runs that are videotaped for slow-motion analysis. “The basic premise is that most people land on their heel (and) overpronate or underpronate,” said Johanna Bjorken, the store’s merchandise director. “This causes running injuries and shoes can address this. This has been the model.” Bjorken said neutral shoes account for 60 to 63 percent of the running shoes sold in her store; 30 to 35 percent are stability shoes. The mobility category is very small and usually follows on doctor’s advice. “Some rolling in is natural, normal and beneficial,” she explained. “Compared to 20 years ago, running shoes are really much more flexible, lightweight and well designed to work with movements of running.” American Council on Exercise spokesperson, Dr. Mark Kelly, a runner for 35 years, is a self-described underpronator who believes in heeding an individual’s “biomechanical tendencies.” “Get a certified trainer to look at the biomechanics of how you’re running,” Kelly said. “How are you turning your foot? Are you a forefoot striker, midfoot striker, heel striker, or extreme heel striker?” Connecticut-based exercise physiologist Tom Holland, author of “The Marathon Method,” thinks many of the common running-related injuries, such as runner’s knee, shin splints and hip issues are related to and exacerbated by improper footwear. “Once you find a shoe that works for you, stick with it,” he said. Nevertheless, a recent Danish study cast doubt on whether shoes that control pronation do actually cut down on injury. But the scientists said more work is needed to determine if highly pronated feet face a higher risk of injury than neutral feet. Student:","response":"Choosing the correct level of pronation control in running shoes is crucial for preventing overuse injuries and ensuring proper shoe fit, according to medical professionals and fitness experts."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - Perverted Justice Foundation, Inc., more commonly known as Perverted-Justice (also known as PeeJ), is an American organization based in California and Oregon, which investigates, identifies, and publicizes the conduct of adults posing as minors in order to solicit online sexual conversations with actual minors. - Sylvia Rae Rivera (July 2, 1951 February 19, 2002) was an American gay liberation and transgender activist and drag queen.

Some early members included Jim Owles, Marty Robinson, Kay Lahusen, Arthur Bell, Arthur Evans, Bill Bahlman, Vito Russo, Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, Jim Coles, Brenda Howard, David Thorstad, Michael Giammetta and Morty Manford (son of Jeanne Manford). GAA's first president was Jim Owles. - David Thorstad ( born June 6 , 1941 ) is an American political activist engaged with pro-pederast and pro-pedophile activism within the North American Man / Boy Love Association ( commonly known as NAMBLA ) , of which he was a founding member . He was also a former president of New York 's Gay Activists Alliance . Thorstad describes himself as a bisexual pederast and atheist ( former Pentecostal ) who has \`\` never been charged with violating any sex laws '' . - The North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) is a pedophile and pederasty advocacy organization in the United States. It works to abolish age-of-consent laws criminalizing adult sexual involvement with minors and campaigns for the release of men who have been jailed for sexual contacts with minors that did not involve coercion. The group no longer holds regular national meetings, and as of the late 1990sto avoid local police infiltrationthe organization discouraged the formation of local chapters. Around 1995, an undercover detective discovered there were 1,100 people on the organization's rolls. In 1997, NAMBLA was the largest group in IPCE, an international pro-pedophile activist organization. Since then, the organization has dwindled to only a handful of people, with many members joining online pedophile networks such as DanPedo, BoyChat, and Annabelleigh, according to Xavier Von Erck, director of operations at the anti-pedophile organization Perverted-Justice.

By Mike Dawes Three French internationals who play for Clermont Auvergne have been injured in a machete attack by a gang in southern France, police said on Sunday. Aurelien Rougerie, Julien Pierre and Benjamin Kayser were attacked by a 12-strong gang in Millau, southern France, in the early hours of Sunday morning. A club statement said none of the players' injuries were life-threatening, adding that weapons used included machetes, knives and swords. Attack: Aurelien Rougerie was one of three France internationals attacked by a gang with machetes on Sunday Aurelien Rougerie Age: 33. Position: Wing/Centre Clubs: Clermont. France caps: 77 'We are deeply shocked and outraged by these acts and will bring all the necessary support to local authorities who have launched a probe,'","response":"Clermont Auvergne's president, Eric de Cromieres, said in the statement. Authorities are now working to determine the motive behind the attack. According to witnesses, the three players were returning to their hotel after a night out when they were confronted by the gang. Despite their injuries, Rougerie, Pierre, and Kayser managed to escape and alert the hotel staff, who called the police. The French Rugby Federation (FFR) released a statement expressing their support for the players and their families, as well as condemning the violence. \\"Our thoughts are with Aurelien, Julien, Benjamin, their families, and Clermont Auvergne at this difficult time,\\" the statement read. Local police have launched a manhunt for the 12 suspects, but no arrests have been made at the time of publishing. Rumors suggest that the trio could have been targeted due to their sporting profile or as a random act of violence. The attack has alarmed residents of Millau, a small town known for its picturesque landscapes and friendly atmosphere. The incident comes at an unfortunate time, as the community is in the midst of hosting its annual Petanque Tournament, a key event in the southern French sports calendar. The players, shaken by the incident, are expected to undergo medical examinations and treatment for their injuries. Clermont Auvergne has assured fans that Rougerie, Pierre, and Kayser will be provided with all the necessary support to ensure their physical and mental recovery.

Let us analyze various aspects of the premise and the hypothesis to gain a better understanding. Firstly, the premise outlines a specific event called \\"Skyrosearnival\\" that occurs annually on the island. The entire island community participates in this festival, demonstrating a strong sense of unity and social bond among the islanders. Celebrations of such a grand scale are often deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of a particular place. In this case, the Skyrosearnival serves not only as a way to bring people together but also as an opportunity for the islanders to engage in various social and cultural activities, promoting their unique heritage, values, and beliefs on a larger platform. Secondly, the premise clearly mentions that the Skyrosearnival takes place in the days leading up to Lent. Lent is a solemn religious observance in the Christian liturgical calendar that involves fasting, prayer, and penance for roughly 40 days before Easter, in commemoration of Jesus Christ's fasting in the desert. Those who observe Lent follow a period of reflection, repentance, and self-discipline to prepare themselves for the commemoration of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection, known as Good Friday and Easter Sunday, respectively. Considering this religious context, it is quite likely that the Skyrosearnival serves as a form of communal preparation, rejoicing, and indulgence before the solemnity and austere observance of Lent. Through the Skyrosearnival, the islanders share a collective experience that allows them to celebrate their cultural and spiritual heritage while also preparing themselves for the upcoming period of self-restraint during Lent. Hence, the hypothesis \\"In the days leading up to Lent, there are events that the island takes place in\\" is indeed true based on the information presented in the premise. The Skyrosearnival is an annual event where the entire island participates, representing an essential part of their cultural practices and traditions. It occurs just before Lent, serving as a celebratory platform for the islanders and acting as a symbolic bridge between their cultural heritage and religious observance during Lent."},{"question":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Every detail was covered, from a rich broth of miso soup with clams to lovely service from a friendly server. He was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. The interior is contemporary Japanese and beautiful. And the food was fantastic. We had a tasty hamachi sashimi with jalapeno slices. I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish. Tuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing. Blue fin toro with caviar.

For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope. - In computer science, program optimization or software optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources. In general, a computer program may be optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or is capable of operating with less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power. - In computer science and particularly in compiler design, loop nest optimization (LNO) is an optimization technique that applies a set of loop transformations for the purpose of locality optimization or parallelization or other loop overhead reduction of the loop nests. One classical usage is to reduce memory access latency or the cache bandwidth necessary due to cache reuse for some common linear algebra algorithms. - The polyhedral model ( also called the polytope method ) is a mathematical framework for loop nest optimization in program optimization . The polytope method treats each loop iteration within nested loops as lattice points inside mathematical objects called polytopes , performs affine transformations or more general non-affine transformations such as tiling on the polytopes , and then converts the transformed polytopes into equivalent , but optimized ( depending on targeted optimization goal ) , loop nests through polyhedra scanning . - The Multinational Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactics Facility Polygone - POLYGON is an Electronic Warfare Tactics Range located on the border between Germany and France.

A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - In elementary geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons) is a solid in three dimensions with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices. The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek , as \\"poly-\\" (stem of , \\"many\\") + \\"-hedron\\" (form of , \\"base\\" or \\"seat\\"). - A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. - A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program. What entity does 'polytope model' has the relation 'subclass of' with?

He is credited with reforming the constitution of ancient Athens and setting it on a democratic footing in 508/7 BC. For these accomplishments, historians refer to him as \\"the father of Athenian democracy.\\" He was the maternal grandson of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon, as the younger son of the latter's daughter Agariste and her husband Megacles. Also, he was credited with increasing the power of the Athenian citizens assembly and for reducing the power of the nobility over Athenian politics. - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries. - The Peloponnesian League was an alliance in the Peloponnesus from the 6th to the 4th centuries BC. It is known mainly for being one of the two rivals in the Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) - The Clouds ( Ancient Greek : Nephelai ) is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes . A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens , it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423 BC and was not as well - received as the author had hoped , coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year . It was revised between 420 - 417 BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form . No copy of the original production survives , and scholarly analysis indicates that the revised version is an incomplete form of Old Comedy . This incompleteness , however , is not obvious in translations and modern performances . Retrospectively , The Clouds can be considered the world 's first extant ' comedy of ideas ' , and is considered by literary critics to be among the finest example of the genre . The play also , however , remains notorious for its caricature of Socrates , and is mentioned in Plato 's Apology as a contributor to the philosopher 's trial and execution . - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. - The Delian League, founded in 478 BC, was an association of Greek city-states, members numbering between 150 173, to 330 under the leadership of Athens, whose purpose was to continue fighting the Persian Empire after the Greek victory in the Battle of Plataea at the end of the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The League's modern name derives from its official meeting place, the island of Delos, where congresses were held in the temple and where the treasury stood until, in a symbolic gesture, Pericles moved it to Athens in 454 BC. - Aristophanes (or ; c. 446 c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it. - The Lamian War, or the Hellenic War (323322 BC) was fought by a coalition of Greek cities including Athens and the Aetolian League against Macedon and its ally Boeotia. The war ended in a Macedonian victory. - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused. - Pericles (\\"Perikls\\", in Classical Attic; c. 495 429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek statesman, orator and general of Athens during the Golden Agespecifically the time between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Hegemony (or , or \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE 6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\". - Democracy (\\"\\" literally \\"rule of the commoners\\"), in modern usage, is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament. Democracy is sometimes referred to as \\"rule of the majority\\". Democracy was originally conceived in Classical Greece, where political representatives were chosen by a jury from amongst the male citizens: rich and poor. - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. - Polis, plural poleis literally means city in Greek. It can also mean citizenship and body of citizens. In modern historiography, \\"polis\\" is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as \\"city-state\\". - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? Options: A. not enough information B. after using water C. after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser D. after using soap === The correct answer is A:","response":"C. after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"question":"Can you tell me the answer to when did japan give cherry trees to washington dc??","response":"Of course!

Telemarketing rules limit the kind of phone calls consumers can receive, but scam calls ignore those restrictions. Calls with prerecorded messages made by computerized dialing devices, commonly known as robocalls, are forbidden with just a few exceptions. (Unfortunately, calls from politicians are one of those exceptions.) So when you get a robocall, often from a generic-sounding company such as “Cardholder Services,” it’s probably a scam. Typically, the recording tries to convince you that you can lower the interest rate on your credit card or extend your auto warranty, enticing you to get on the line with a real person. Ultimately, they want you to pay them money for a worthless offer. Lately, though, more people are complaining about an increase of these calls, which pretend to be from government agencies and utilities. A reader recently wrote in about calls from the Internal Revenue Service threatening arrest if he didn’t pay money he supposedly owed. The IRS might not be a beloved agency, but that sort of call is not part of its repertoire. The scam tries to coax a frightened recipient of the call to send money to avoid arrest. Similarly, National Grid and other utilities are warning about calls instructing consumers to provide bank account information over the phone immediately or have their electricity or gas shut off. While utilities make reminder calls (sometimes using prerecorded messages) noting that failure to pay a bill could result in utilities getting turned off, the legitimate calls won’t demand financial information. The easiest way to verify the legitimacy of such a call is to contact the utility directly at the phone number on the bill, not the one the caller gives. The Do Not Call list can help with legitimate telemarketers, but it doesn’t help with scams. Consumers can report the calls to the Federal Trade Commission using the agency’s online form, but that doesn’t mean the calls will stop. So be on guard for this latest round of scam calls, and do not give out personal or financial information on any call you don’t initiate.","response":"Unmasking Robocalls: Deciphering Annoying Telemarketing from Dangerous Scams"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: why is francis disheveled? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Keys of the Kingdom Context: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice.

After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of Blackpool, in 1932 he was signed by First Division Manchester City, with whom he played his entire professional career. Swift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2-1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. During the Second World War, Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the British Army, and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the Army School of Physical Training as part of a scheme devised by the FA. The school was based near Aldershot F.C. leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included Matt Busby, Jimmy Hagan, Joe Mercer, Stan Cullis, Cliff Britton and Tommy Lawton. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including Liverpool. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at Ninian Park, Swift played for a Western Command XI against a Cardiff City XI which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for Royal Artillery prisoners of war. In April 1944 in Edinburgh he played for a British Army XI that included Jack Rowley, Leslie Compton, Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a Royal Air Force XI that included Peter Doherty, Stanley Matthews and Ted Drake. The Army won 4-0. On 9 September 1944 at Windsor Park he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8-4 win against Ireland. This team was in effect a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, Raich Carter and Stan Mortensen. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against France and Belgium. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour. In the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when Alex Williams broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985. By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the 1948-49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.

Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins.

It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us. Their first gig was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at Saint Martins College. The band played at the school on 6 November 1975, in support of a pub rock group called Bazooka Joe, arranging to use their amps and drums. The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs, including the Who's \\"Substitute\\", the Small Faces' \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\", and \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\", made famous by the Monkees; according to observers, they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud.

Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - Davos (archaic Italian: \\"Tavate\\", local German pronunciation , German pronunciation ) is a municipality in the district of Prättigau/Davos in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland.

At , it is the highest \\"town\\" in Europe. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\".

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Landwasser (German, lit.: \\"water of/for the land\\") is a river in Switzerland, canton of Graubünden. Its origin was Lake Davos before this was turned into a reservoir for a power station. Nowadays it is prolonged by the creek Flüelabach at its source and changes its name near Davos Dorf.

Landwasser empties into the Albula below Filisur. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.

He was an American songwriter who is best known for composing this song. \\"He's So Fine\\" is a classic example of 1960s doo-wop and pop music, characterized by its distinctive melody, catchy rhythm, and memorable lyrics. The song became widely popular and achieved commercial success after it was recorded and released by The Chiffons, an all-female vocal group from the United States. In 1963, The Chiffons recorded \\"He's So Fine\\" under the supervision of producer and composer Phil Spector. The song features three singers from The Chiffons – Judy Craig (lead vocalist), Patricia Bennett, and Barbara Lee, with Sylvia Peterson joining the group later. \\"He's So Fine\\" became the Chiffons' biggest and most enduring hit, soaring to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and remaining there for four weeks. The song's success catapulted The Chiffons to new heights of fame and secured their place in music history. The distinct sound and style of \\"He's So Fine\\" has had a lasting influence on popular music, inspiring numerous covers, adaptations, and even legal disputes.

Melinda Beck on Lunch Break looks at why this happens. The next time you're outrunning a pack of hungry wolves, naked, and then wake up in a cold sweat, remind yourself it's only a bad dream—and that it could be a side effect of a prescription medication you're taking. A wide array of drugs can cause nightmares. The list includes certain antidepressants, antibiotics, beta blockers, blood-pressure medications, statins for lowering cholesterol and drugs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Some drugs tend to cause bad dreams when they are first taken; others bring nightmares when they're stopped. Alcohol, over-the-counter antihistamines and some dietary supplements have the same effect. \\"This is a very common complaint,\\" says Andres San Martin, a psychiatrist in New York City. \\"You put a patient on an antidepressant and routinely, they'll say, 'You know I'm feeling better, but I'm having very vivid dreams.' The emotion and passion can be quite overwhelming.\\" Although the mechanisms aren't completely understood, sleep experts think drugs cause nightmares because they interfere with so-called sleep architecture—the stages of light, deep and rapid-eye-movement, or REM, sleep that people typically rotate through three or four times a night. The REM stages, during which the most vivid dreams occur, normally get longer toward morning. But some medications delay or decrease REM, and some create a \\"REM rebound\\" effect when people stop taking them, making the REM stage unusually long or intense. A broad array of prescription medications, including those to treat anxiety, high blood pressure and ADHD can cause disturbing, unusual dreams. \\"Whenever REM sleep is altered, that leads to nightmares,\\" says Naresh Dewan, a professor of sleep medicine at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., and co-author of a review of drug-induced sleep disturbances in June in the journal Consultant Pharmacist. Sleep experts say medications particularly apt to bring troubling dreams are those that affect neurotransmitters, the brain's chemical messengers that influence sleep cycles, among other things. That includes most antidepressants, as well as antihistamines and anticholinergic drugs used to treat a broad range of conditions, from overactive bladder to bronchial spasms. Sleeping pills can also disrupt sleep cycles and cause nightmares. Pinpointing how frequently medications cause nightmares is difficult because bad dreams are so common, and there's no way to prove cause and effect. Nearly 90% of people have nightmares at some point and about 5% of adults have them chronically, according to the American Sleep Association. Bad dreams may also be due to sleep apnea, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder or a carry-over from anxiety during the day. People should suspect a drug connection if weird or disturbing dreams have begun soon after starting a new medication or stopping an old one, sleep specialists say. Sleep experts say drugs may interfere with so-called sleep architecture. Some prescription drug labels have warnings of mention the possibility of nightmares, abnormal dreams or sleep disturbances, but some experts say nightmares they are probably underreported in trials and on labels because patients don't think to mention them, and doctors rarely ask. \\"From a doctor's point of view, it's sometimes a Pandora's box because if you start routinely asking all patients about their dreams, you may be opening something that medicine cannot fix,\\" says P. Murali Doraiswamy a neuroscientist at Duke University Medical School. It isn't clear why disrupted REM sleep tends to bring nightmares rather than more pleasant dreams. \\"The purpose, triggers and biology of dreams, both pleasant and frightening, are still some of the biggest mysteries in all of science,\\" says Dr. Doraiswamy. \\"It could be an evolutionary defense mechanism or could be the brain's way of doing psychotherapy on itself.\\" Modern psychiatrists, led by Allan Hobson of Harvard Medical School, believe dreams are electrical pulses from the brain stem randomly bombarding the center of the brain where visual memories are stored, creating kaleidoscopes of images around which the brain concocts stories. Followers of Sigmund Freud believe dreams are repressed desires or threats. Nightmares aren't necessarily harmful themselves, but if they happen frequently, they can set the stage for chronic sleep deprivation, which can hamper daytime functioning and increase the risk of diabetes and other health problems. Some nightmares are so disturbing that the effects linger for hours or longer. Alesandra Rain still recalls the dreams of suicide she had while taking a variety of sleep and pain medications nine years ago. In one, she went skydiving with a defective parachute; in another, she removed the lug nuts from her tires and gunned her car down a winding mountain road. Ms. Rain, 54, was so disturbed by the dreams and the long list of drugs she was taking that she quit them cold turkey and started a nonprofit organization, Point of Return, in Westlake Village, Calif., to help others wean themselves off of multiple prescription drugs. \\"I haven't had a nightmare in nine years,\\" she says. Some medications that have been reported to cause abnormal dreams and other sleep disturbances. Source: Drug labels; The Consultant Pharmacist, June, 2011 Most physicians tell patients not to stop medications abruptly on their own. Tapering off can help avoid withdrawal nightmares. In some cases, taking a drug at a different time of day can improve sleep. Dr. San Martin tells patients to take some SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in the morning, but those that have a sedative effect closer to bedtime. Cutting dosages or switching to another brand in the same class may also be an option. For severe sleep disruption, some doctors give patients yet another prescription to help them sleep. Common choices include Klonopin, an antiseizure medication; Trazodone, often used in sleep clinics for insomnia, or Prazosin, a beta blocker that helps quell anxiety. All three can bring on nightmares themselves, so some doctors see prescribing a new drug as a last resort. Some chronic nightmare sufferers find relief with Image Rehearsal Therapy, a technique pioneered in the 1990s in which patients write out their typical nightmare, then imagine a new, benign ending for it. Shelby Harris, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., says her favorite example was a young patient who kept dreaming he was being chased by a scary man. In the new scenario he concocted, the setting was the theme park in Hershey, Pa. The man was made of chocolate and the boy ate him. Patients practice visualizing the new dream several times a day for several weeks. Even if that particular dream never recurs, the nightmares typically end. \\"Once people believe they have control over their nightmare, that's when they start to get better,\\" says Dr. Harris. Experts say that people who are troubled by nightmares should let their doctors know. Disturbed REM sleep and vivid dreaming can also be an early warning sign of some types of epilepsy, dementia and Parkinson's disease. \\"It's important to address whether [nightmares] are due to a medication or if something else is going on,\\" says Dr. Harris. \\"Don't assume that nothing can be done.\\" Write to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Many of these new rental buildings are large, tall and unusually shaped. Some are in untested residential areas, which might explain their devotion to lavishly entertaining their occupants by piling on the amenities both indoors and out. Soon-to-be-completed examples include Via 57West, on an industrial edge of Manhattan’s West Side; 461 Dean Street, by the Barclays Center at the Vanderbilt Yards in Brooklyn; and 365 Bond Street, on the banks of the Gowanus Canal. Prices, too, are lofty, with studios in some of the buildings renting for about 5,000 a month. While any softness in the rental market — new leasing activity has slowed in recent months, and vacancies are up — could spell challenges going forward, most developers say they are undeterred. “New York is safer and cleaner than it’s been in decades, and we fully expect people to keep moving here,” said Adam R. Rose, a president of Rose Associates, which is converting 70 Pine Street, an Art Deco office building in the financial district, into a 776-unit rental. “And the fact is, we need virtually unlimited housing at all levels,” he added. Once, a driveway and porte-cochere might have been enough to provide a building with an air of prestige, but rentals today seem to be springing for brash top-to-bottom designs. Like their condo kin, rentals are increasingly opting for architects with boldface names. Via 57West, a 709-unit rental at 625 West 57th Street, for example, was designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group. Mr. Ingels is the Danish designer whose résumé also includes Two World Trade Center. Those expecting four walls and a roof at Via, which is to open in March, may be disappointed. There is no roof at all, only sloping walls that taper to a point at the 42nd story, recalling a tilting tepee or a wizard’s hat, though the developer, the Durst Organization, prefers “tetrahedron.” Because the metal-paneled rental is near the West Side Highway, a gateway to Manhattan, the city’s Planning Commission didn’t want some humdrum rectangle, according to Durst officials. But Mr. Ingels’ great pyramid also allowed Durst to preserve Hudson River views from the windows of the Helena, a rental that the company owns next door, according to a Durst spokesman. The offbeat style produced unusual layouts. A 685-square-foot one-bedroom with tall windows that was a stop on a recent tour had an angled exterior wall, which might not be ideal for straight-backed furniture. “We have apartments with a lot of character to them,” said Jonathan Drescher, a Durst senior vice president. And those apartments seem tailored to younger, unattached renters, as 85 percent are studios, starting at 2,770 a month, or one-bedrooms, starting at 3,880. In contrast, the median price of a studio in Manhattan in December was 2,562 a month, while that of a one-bedroom was 3,375, according to a market report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Via and other buildings are adding rental units to the market in a banner development year. About 4,900 apartments in large and mostly market-rate buildings are expected to open their doors in Manhattan in 2016, according to data prepared for The New York Times by Cliff Finn, an executive vice president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, and George Wlodarczyk, a research director there. This is a significant increase, as the number has hovered below 3,000 a year since at least 2010. Eight of the 15 major buildings to open this year, according to Elliman, offer 300 apartments or more. Similarly, Brooklyn will add about 3,300 apartments in major projects in 2016, Elliman said, the most since 2014, when about 3,000 units entered the market. But in previous years, going back to 2007, the number of new apartments that opened in the borough was much lower. This housing surge comes at a time of some weakness in the market. In December, the median rent in the Manhattan luxury market — that is, the top 10 percent of all transactions — nudged down to 8,500 a month from 8,537 a month in November. Similarly, the November median was down from October, when it was 8,750, according to Elliman data prepared by Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. In addition, the city has more empty apartments than usual. Traditionally, in New York, the dividing line between a robust and not-so-great market is a 2 percent vacancy rate. Since June of last year, the rate has been higher, with November’s at 2.87 percent, the highest in nine years, Mr. Miller said. In December, the rate was 2.74 percent. With empty apartments and dipping rents, the market is not ideally suited for thousands of new units, which could depress prices further. For renters, that could be a good thing. Mr. Miller said concessions are already part of the picture. Both Via 57West and 70 Pine are offering two free months on a 14-month lease, which is more than the one month traditionally offered under similar conditions, Mr. Miller said. “I think there is great confusion about demand for this product,” Mr. Miller added. “It’s not correct to say that demand is not there for this new product. It is more accurate to say that in many, if not most, cases, demand is not there at prices set a few years ago.” Of course, developers won’t really know where things stand until their rental offices actually open. But so far, many of the rentals scheduled to hit the market in the next few months come with high monthly price tags. The new 11-story, 106-unit rental from the Related Companies at 456 Washington Street in TriBeCa, for instance, will have studios starting at 4,995 a month, while one-bedrooms will start at 5,295, though a Related spokeswoman pointed out that the building, which is to open in May, is in a prime location, and that its apartments are larger than most of the firm’s other properties. Studios are around 600 square feet, she said, while one-bedrooms range from 700 to 750 square feet. Also in May, Related will unveil the Easton, a 230-unit rental on East 92nd Street, where one-bedrooms will start at 4,295 a month. If rents seem steep, they need to be considered along with the costs of building apartment houses, which can be astronomical, according to Jed Walentas, a principal of Two Trees Management Company, which is developing 300 Ashland Place, a 379-unit tower across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, to open at summer’s end. The building, clad in aluminum-composite panels, was designed by TEN Arquitectos, Enrique Norten’s firm. From above, the building resembles a flattened football with its pointed ends trimmed, creating slightly curving walls. It was built under the 421-a program, which gives developers breaks on their property taxes if they construct and maintain affordable housing in a so-called 80-20 building — 80 percent market-rate rents and 20 percent below-market or affordable rents. Developers say that in a city where land is so pricey, it can be almost impossible to build without the program, especially rentals, for which revenue trickles in over time. The controversial benefit, which critics say enriches developers at the expense of the public and has outlived its usefulness, expired in January, and its impending end helped fuel the current rental-building boom, some developers say. Other builders, though, say the rental surge is more the result of the post-recession recovery, and began when these projects were conceived a few years ago. At 300 Ashland Place, 421-a has made a big difference. The 170 million project will realize savings of up to 2 million a year in property taxes for 25 years, or about 50 million, according to Two Trees officials, in exchange for the building’s 76 below-market-rate apartments. As Mr. Walentas scanned the horizon from his rising tower, which provides views of low-slung sections of Brooklyn that were mostly unattainable before the rental boom, he said he wasn’t worried about competition. “The more people build, the better it’s going to be for everybody,” he said, adding that the rising buildings help strengthen neighborhoods. One new rental in the current crop, 461 Dean Street in Brooklyn, will be split almost evenly between apartments with below-market rents and market-rate apartments. The 363-unit project from Forest City Ratner Companies, which is made of prefabricated modules, will have 181 apartments with lower rents. About 40 percent of the affordable units, or 72, will be for people making 100 percent to 160 percent of the area’s median income, or up to 138,080 for a family of four. That family could end up paying 2,800 a month for a two-bedroom, said Susi Yu, an executive vice president of Forest City. “This is actually a segment of the market that really has been overlooked,” Ms. Yu said, referring to the income bracket of that same family of four. Forest City has not yet determined what a market-rate two-bedroom would cost in the building. In December, the median price of a two-bedroom in Brooklyn was 3,350 a month, Elliman said. To score one of the coveted reduced-rent units at 461 Dean, renters must enter a lottery, which will be organized by Forest City and the city’s Housing Development Corporation. When the lottery is announced, which is expected “imminently,” according to a project spokeswoman, applicants will have 60 days to register at the New York City Housing Connect web page, or by paper application. To get the word out about the application process, Forest City will contact labor unions, community boards and churches. Each applicant will receive a number. If that number is drawn, he or she must submit tax returns, landlord references and bank statements to verify eligibility. Priority will be given to people with visual impairments and other disabilities, and secondarily, to those who live within the boundaries of Brooklyn Community Boards 2, 3, 6 and 8. Municipal workers also will have an advantage. As has been the case for several years, buildings in less-residential neighborhoods are packed with extras designed to give their occupants something to do in otherwise quiet areas. But the amount of space dedicated to these amenities has mushroomed. At Via by the West Side Highway, for instance, the 30,000 square feet of indoor amenity space will include a 75-foot swimming pool, a half basketball court and a leather-walled room designated for poker. A terraced courtyard planted with pitch pines, river birches and honey locusts will offer another 22,000 square feet of communal space. Four retail spaces will line the building’s base. Another 75-foot swimming pool will turn up at Eos, a glassy 375-unit Durst project at 100 West 31st Street in NoMad to open this year. Sidewalk windows peer down at the pool, so passers-by can admire people doing the backstroke below. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, at 365 Bond Street, a 430-unit, 80-20 building from the Lightstone Group next to the Gowanus Canal, a Superfund site, residents will avail themselves of 40,000 square feet of amenity space. Among the offerings are a yoga room, a children’s playroom and a rooftop lounge with barbecue grills. The building, which broke ground in 2014, opens in March. Interest in the affordable component has been intense, with more than 56,000 applications received for the 86 below-market units. Applications closed last month. Market-rate studios there will start in the “low 2,000s,” a spokesman said, adding that “we don’t have concessions finalized yet.” The building will be by a dock from which kayaks can be launched for paddling the Gowanus, which is scheduled to be cleaned starting this year, said Mitchell C. Hochberg, Lightstone’s president. “I think Gowanus is one of the most exciting places in the city, like Williamsburg 10 years ago,” Mr. Hochberg said. But in a shift, even developers in more central areas are acknowledging a new cultural reality: that young renters, who may work and live under the same roof, and have all their groceries delivered, might not set foot outside that much. At amenity-loaded 70 Pine, “the whole idea is that you don’t ever have to leave the building,” Mr. Rose said. Rents for studios on the lower floors of the 1932 building, which are now being marketed, start at 3,100 a month, and 21 leases were signed between December and the end of January. The next batch of studios, on higher floors, will inch up to 3,200 a month, Mr. Rose said. The building has about 19,000 square feet of amenities, spread across two below-grade levels, including a two-lane bowling alley and a 20-seat screening room in an old bank vault, whose door will be welded into the open position. Seventy Pine’s fitness center will be run by La Palestra, a company whose services extend to arranging out-of-building exercise at places like Mount Kilimanjaro. There will be about 31,500 square feet of retail space, including a branch of the upscale grocer Urban Market. And the top four levels of the building, which has a window-lined observation deck, will house a yet-to-be named restaurant from the team behind the Spotted Pig in the West Village. The list of amenities dazzles even Mr. Rose. “I’ve been in this business for 30 years, and we’ve never done this much in one place before,” he said. Correction: February 9, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the maximum income for a family of four to be eligible for an affordable two-bedroom apartment at 461 Dean Street in Brooklyn, based on information supplied by the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies. It is 138,080, not 124,000. Summary:","response":"New York is seeing an influx of luxury apartment buildings opening across Manhattan and Brooklyn, redefining rental property expectations within the city. Over 8,000 new rental units are set to open this year alone, boasting a variety of high-end features and amenities, as bold face-name architects now also design rental properties, in addition to condos. The prices are increasing just as quickly as the buildings themselves, with the median price of a studio apartment in Manhattan now at 2,562 a month, according to a market report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. A significant increase in new apartment buildings is expected in Manhattan this year, with around 4,900 large rental units coming to the market, up from below 3,000 a year since at least 2010. Developers seem confident in the market despite recent increases in the number of empty apartments."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What's the answer to that question: what was tupac name in juice?

The organizers of New York City's annual march down Fifth Avenue are about to find out. The makers of the popular Irish beer announced over the weekend that they pulled their sponsorship of the parade due to organizers' longstanding rule against gay and lesbian groups marching openly. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT \\"Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all,” the company said in a statement posted on the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation website Sunday. \\"We were hopeful that the policy of exclusion would be reversed for this year’s parade. As this has not come to pass, Guinness has withdrawn its participation. We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy.\\" The move by Guinness follows similar moves by fellow beer companies Heineken and Sam Adams, the latter of which pulled its sponsorship from Sunday's parade in the traditional Irish stronghold of South Boston. The decision also left Ford Motor Company as the only major U.S. company sponsoring the New York City parade, which dates back to 1762. Companies aren't the only ones conspicuous by their absence from city parades. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio will become the first mayor in decades to sit out the march due to the dispute. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh didn't take part in his city's parade, either, after talks broke down that would have allowed a gay group to march. One leader who does plan to march in New York Monday is Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who defended himself against criticism over his decision earlier this week, saying \\"The St. Patrick's Day parade (in New York) is a parade about our Irishness and not about sexuality, and I would be happy to participate in it.\\" Parade organizers have said gay groups are not prohibited from marching, but are not allowed to carry gay-friendly signs or identify themselves as LGBT. In Michigan, parades were Sunday held in Bay City and Detroit, and on Monday a St. Patrick's Day Parade was scheduled in Cleveland. Cities from Savannah, Ga., to Montreal also hosted festivities over the weekend, and throughout the world landmarks were bathed in green floodlights. Some LGBT groups were to protest the parade, while others had planned to dump Guinness from the shelves of the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the gay rights movement. That demonstration was canceled late Sunday after Guinness put out its statement yanking its sponsorship. Despite the controversy, New York's parade, a tradition that predates the city itself, is expected to draw more than 1 million spectators and about 200,000 participants Monday. It has long been a mandatory stop on the city's political trail, and will include marching bands, traditional Irish dancers and thousands of uniformed city workers. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Bill de Blasio and Martin Walsh (L) speak to the press outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, December 13, 2013, following their meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama and other newly-elected mayors about job creation. BOSTON Irish brewer Guinness said on Sunday that it would not participate in New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade this year because gay and lesbian groups had been excluded, costing organizers a key sponsor of the annual event. The move came on the same day that Boston's Irish-American mayor skipped that city's St. Patrick's Day parade after failing to hammer out a deal with organizers to allow a group of gay and lesbian activists to march openly. \\"Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all. We were hopeful that the policy of exclusion would be reversed for this year's parade,\\" the brewer said in a written statement issued by a spokesman for its parent company, Diageo. \\"As this has not come to pass, Guinness has withdrawn its participation. We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy,\\" Guinness said. Last week New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would not march in the parade because gay and lesbian activists had been again precluded from taking part. The loss of Guinness, one of the world's top beer brands originating in Dublin, Ireland, appeared to ratchet up the pressure on organizers even further. On Friday, two other major beer companies, Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer Co and Heineken dropped their sponsorship of parades in Boston and New York, respectively, over the issue. Representatives for the New York board of the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, which has run the parade for more than 150 years, could not be reached for comment on Sunday afternoon. Earlier in the day Boston Mayor Marty Walsh skipped his city's parade when he couldn't negotiate a deal with organizers, the conservative Allied War Veteran's Council, to allow members of MassEquality, one of Massachusetts' largest gay activist groups, to join. INCREASING CRITICISM \\"So much of our Irish history has been shaped by the fight against oppression,\\" Walsh, the city's first Irish-American mayor in 20 years, said in a statement. \\"As mayor of the city of Boston, I have to do my best to ensure that all Bostonians are free to participate fully in the civic life of our city. Unfortunately, this year, the parties were not able to come to an understanding that would have made that possible.\\" Despite Walsh's boycott, other prominent Democratic Boston politicians, including Representative Stephen Lynch, marched in the parade, which drew tens of thousands of spectators, some of whom expressed disappointment at MassEquality's exclusion. \\"It's supposed to be a time when everyone can come together,\\" said university student Jeyashri Sridhar, 18. \\"It's sad that people can't participate because of who they are.\\" Organizers of St. Patrick's Day parades in New York and Boston, among the most liberal-leaning cities in the United States, have come under increasing criticism in recent years for banning openly gay marchers. Parade organizers argue that to do so would conflict with their Roman Catholic heritage. The Catholic church contends that homosexual activity is immoral. While MassEquality did not participate, the parade was not without gay marchers. South Boston resident Randy Foster, along with his husband Steve Martin, organized a diversity-themed float that sported rainbow flags but no direct gay rights messages. Foster said the flags represented the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in Irish lore, though he acknowledged the gay-rights movement uses a rainbow flag. \\"If there's a dual message to it, we're OK with it and so are the parade organizers,\\" said Foster, 48. \\"We made the point of not making it a gay float. If we're going to have a message of inclusion, it shouldn't be for one group.\\" Massachusetts in 2003 became the first U.S. state to legalize gay marriage. Attitudes on gay marriage have changed markedly across the nation since then, with 17 states and the District of Columbia now allowing same-sex couples to wed.

Boston's Mayor Martin Walsh opted out of his city's parade on Sunday after talks broke down that would have allowed a gay veterans group to march. Parade organizers said they did not want the event to turn into a demonstration for a particular group, but Walsh said their plans prevented all Boston residents from participating fully. Still, thousands of green-clad spectators came out to watch bagpipers and marchers in Boston, and organizers of a float intended to promote diversity threw Mardi Gras-type beads to onlookers. A similar scene played out in downtown Philadelphia. In Michigan, parades were Sunday held in Bay City and Detroit, and on Monday, a St. Patrick's Day Parade was scheduled in Cleveland. Cities from Savannah, Ga., to Montreal also hosted festivities over the weekend, and throughout the world, landmarks were bathed in green floodlights. Ireland's head of government, Enda Kenny, on Sunday became the first Irish prime minister to attend Boston's annual St. Patrick's Day breakfast. Kenny has resisted pressure, in both Ireland and America, to support the gay rights lobby's demand to have equal rights to participate in parades on St. Patrick's Day. \\"The St. Patrick's Day parade (in New York) is a parade about our Irishness and not about sexuality, and I would be happy to participate in it,\\" he said in Dublin before leaving for a six-day trip to the U.S. In Ireland, St. Patrick's Day provides the launch of the country's annual push for tourism, a big part of the rural economy. \\"To Irish people by birth or descent, wherever they may be in the world, and to those who simply consider themselves to be friends of Ireland, I wish each and every one of you a happy, peaceful and authentically Irish St. Patrick's Day,\\" Irish President Michael D. Higgins, the ceremonial head of state and guest of honor at Monday's parade in Dublin, said in a statement. Parade organizers in New York have said gay groups are not prohibited from marching, but are not allowed to carry gay-friendly signs or identify themselves as LGBT. Some LGBT groups were to protest the parade along the parade route on Fifth Avenue on Monday. Others had planned to dump Guinness beer from the shelves of the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the gay rights movement, in protest of the brewer's plan to sponsor the parade, but that demonstration was canceled late Sunday after Guinness said in a statement that it had dropped its sponsorship. Other beer companies joined the boycotts earlier, with Sam Adams withdrawing its sponsorship of Boston's parade and Heineken following suit in New York. New York's parade, a tradition that predates the city itself, draws more than 1 million spectators and about 200,000 participants every March 17.

He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests.

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\". I’d been waiting for years to have a cat again, and adopted an older one that needed to be rehomed. I did not realize the cat was as old as she was when I took her and her age quickly started to show. She only moves to eat and use litter box. The rest of the time she rests in one spot. That’s it. Very sweet cat but she’s like a living fixture in my house. When I was first dating SO, one of the earlier important questions I asked was if he was ok with cats, if we/I could have a cat down the road if we live together. He said yes. He said yes because we were newly in love and we were enamored with each other and I badly wanted a cat and although he’s an anti-cat guy he said OK. I already had a cat, but I know she is old- I’m asking about another cat. And after a couple of years cat discussions came up and he changed his position on cats. He hates cats, he’s allergic (even though I’ve never seen him have an allergic reaction when he’s over at my place with my cat), says cats are horrible and murderous, they kill for sport, cats stink, litter box stinks, they don’t love their people etc etc etc. And he took back his agreement to have a cat. He now says NO CATS when we live together. The subject of moving in together has come up and we have been looking at places and without any particular rush are planning on living together, that’s the long term plan. Next thing I know, my teenager comes home with a kitten. Now- I didn’t go LOOKING for this kitty. Neither did my teenager who just found it, it was dumped and starving. So we fed the kitten, knowing we couldn’t keep it but just helping until I can get it to a rescue for her forever home. I didn’t mention it to SO because we had other things going on and it was temporary anyway. In hindsight- probably should’ve mentioned it. ..... SO comes over and learns there is a kitten here. I tell him the cat is not staying (even though of course I do want to keep her) I’m going to send her to rescue. He says “No No No No- I know you want that cat your kids are in love with that cat it’s already been here and you guys are attached to the cat. So absolutely DO NOT get rid of that cat because you will be making me the bad guy and no thank you to that. The kids will know it was me who spoiled it and made you get rid of the cat.” He was piiiiiiissed. But told me not to get rid of the cat. Soooooo I kept the cat. But he couldn’t sleep and was so upset because he took this as a HUGE sign that I don’t want to live with him since he said he wouldn’t live with a cat and now here’s cat that will be around for a long time. When this came up in an argument a month or so later, and I reminded him that he told me to keep the cat that he did not want to be the bad guy or make my kids upset that they had to part with the kitten. He told me I should’ve known better and that I was supposed to go ahead and not keep the kitty of my own accord, not because he told me to. Great when he tells me this NOW, after we are all really and truly attached to the cat and after the cat is very attached to us. She loves and trusts us very much. I’m reluctant to even try and rehome her now. This is her home. And I love her. I know I should’ve discussed this with SO more as it’s a big decision that affects us both in the event we live together. And I do want to live together. I just want him to accept a cat like he said he would. It’s JUST a cat. Its not a sign that I don’t love SO or want to live together. Now SO is so mad. He doesn’t want to come over. He’s pissed all the time about me getting a cat. It’s almost getting worse. The more he thinks about it, the more upset he is and it’s snowballing into a huge thing. Also he flat out said he will NEVER EVER EVER live with a cat. He wants to live with me 100%. This is not him looking for an excuse not to live together. He does. Just not with my cat. Honestly ..... I love this cat. I really do. It’s important to me. So important that it was one of the few questions I ask in the beginning of a relationship. Dealbreaker questions. And for me a cat is one of those questions. I understand how he feels. ***He feels like I chose this cat over him. Over his feelings. Over our relationship. And he’s very very butthurt.*** But it’s JUST A CAT. I get it. He doesn’t like cats. I wish he would get over it and do this for me. He wishes I would get rid of the cat for him. I told him, it’s fine you don’t have to live with a cat. He said Neither do you. I think he should accept the cat because it means so much to me. Just deal with it it’s not the worst thing in the world. He thinks I don’t care about his feelings and that I should not have a cat because it means so much to him. AITA?

A:","response":"The missing first step of the process is: \\"Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth.\\" The complete process can be detailed as follows: 1. Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth: The process of respiration begins with taking in air through the nose or mouth. The hairs and mucus in the nasal cavity help filter out dust and other foreign particles to ensure that clean air enters the lungs. 2. The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs: Upon entering the respiratory system, the inhaled air passes through the trachea, which then divides into bronchi. The bronchi further branch out into smaller bronchioles, leading to a network of fine tubes in the lungs. 3. Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli: The bronchioles of the lungs eventually terminate in grape-like clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli. 4. Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood: The walls of the alveoli are lined with thin capillaries, where the actual gas exchange occurs. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the alveolar walls into the blood, while carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveoli for exhalation. 5. Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart: The oxygenated blood is then carried by the pulmonary veins towards the heart, in particular, the left atrium. 6. Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart: The heart pumps the oxygenated blood through the aorta and into the arterial system, ensuring its distribution to every part of the body. 7. Cells take in the oxygen-rich blood and release carbon dioxide-rich blood: As the oxygen-rich blood reaches the cells, the oxygen molecules are picked up by hemoglobin molecules found in the red blood cells and transported into the cells. In exchange for the oxygen, the cells release carbon dioxide as a waste product of cellular respiration. 8. The carbon dioxide-rich blood travels to the lungs: The blood with high carbon dioxide concentration flows back to the heart via the veins, making its way to the right atrium and ventricle, before being pumped to the lungs for the removal of this waste product. 9. Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled: The carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli of the lungs and is eventually expelled through the nose or mouth during the process of exhalation, thereby completing the respiratory cycle."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Rugby Football Union (RFU) is the governing body for rugby union in England. It was founded in 1871, and was the sport's international governing body prior to the formation of what is now known as World Rugby (WR) in 1886. It promotes and runs the sport, organises international matches for the England national team, and educates and trains players and officials. - Rugby league football, usually called rugby league, is a full contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field.

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Contact sports are sports that emphasize or require physical contact between players. Some sports, such as mixed martial arts, are scored on impacting an opponent, while others, including rugby football, require tackling of players. These sports are often known as full-contact, as the sport cannot be undertaken without contact.

DHT levels impact beard hair density, while T impacts beard hair thickness. Managing T and DHT levels under medical supervision may enhance your beard growth. Do not use testosterone-boosting pills, creams, injections, or other products without the advice and guidance of your doctor. There can be a range of unwanted side effects, and you could end up impeding beard growth. Your doctor may recommend engaging in regular strength-training sessions as a way to naturally boost testosterone levels. Rogaine, the most common brand name for minoxidil, is widely used to slow the progress of male pattern baldness. If applied to the face properly, it should help stimulate beard growth. However, even though Rogaine is available over the counter in many areas, you should always consult your doctor before using it on your face. This may be a better treatment option if you have patches where your beard doesn’t grow in well, as opposed to wanting your entire beard to grow in faster. If and when you stop treatment, any new hair growth may fall out. Microneedling involves rolling a device on your face that’s similar to a lint roller—except instead of sticky paper on the roller, it has hundreds of tiny needle points. Some advocates for micro-needling believe the tiny pinpricks stimulate the hair follicles and enhance beard growth. Some dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons use in-office micro-needling to address issues like acne. Talk to a medical professional you trust before undergoing micro-needling treatments or buying a device yourself. If used correctly, the process should be safe and relatively painless. However, it’s essential that the device is sanitized properly before each use according to the product instructions (usually by soaking it in alcohol). If there are areas of your beard that simply won’t grow in, hair transplants may be your only choice. As with top-of-the-head hair transplants, individual hair follicles are relocated from one area (like the back of the neck) to another (like your cheek). Hair transplants usually require multiple procedures that are both costly and time-consuming. It may take up to 2 years to see the full results, and the procedure doesn’t always work. Transplants may help fill in gaps in your beard, but it won’t make your beard grow faster.","response":"Testosterone has 2 types, T and DHT. DHT helps make beard hair dense, and T makes it thick.

His is currently writing his second book called Likeonomics on how to be more believable. When an irate traveler tweeted about how he had arrived late to The Four Seasons in Palo Alto and been “bumped” to an inferior room, the hotel saw it immediately and responded, promising to make it up to him. Turns out, the customer spends about 60 nights a year in Palo Alto for work, and promised in his next tweet to spend many of those nights at The Four Seasons. The brand has had several similar stories posted online by delighted customers, and they are exactly the kind of successes that justify the investment in social media for customer service (which, in turn, drives sales). Oct. 27 was the first day of the Social Media for Customer Care Summit in New York, a gathering of some of the largest brands in the world focused on how social service can be leveraged more effectively. Nearly every brand was struggling with the same three big questions, which became discussion topics and hashtags in their own right: Throughout the day, there were many strong ideas and lessons offered on these topic. Here are just a few of the highlights. 1. Don’t allow any one team to own social media. (KLM) In April 2010, Dutch airline KLM was thrown into the jaws of social media head first thanks to the Icelandic ash cloud that covered Europe and grounded flights across the continent for nearly a week. Moving quickly, KLM earned credit by creating a rebooking tool for Facebook within 24 hours and created a “multi-functional” team across customer service, marketing, PR and operations. For the world’s largest airline, this forced integration was just what they needed to build a highly sophisticated view that social media belongs belongs everywhere across the company. When they recently launched 24/7 support on Twitter and Facebook, they did it through a highly engaging “Live Replies” campaign in which they responded to tweets with a small army of staff in an airplane hanger holding up signs. 2. Go through the experience to really get it. (Telus) Canadian telecom brand Telus shared an important lesson about walking in someone else’s shoes. For them, it meant bringing executives into the real “down and dirty” conversations that customers were having with service reps on social media channels. As Carol Borghesi, senior vice president of the brand’s Customer First initiative candidly shared, Telus was rated high on the Canadian list of companies with the “worst customer service.” Social media is a key component of how they plan to be the first telecom in Canada to make it off that notorious list. 3. Help your customer service people feel like rock stars. (Zappos) Of course, no conference about customer service would be complete without a great Zappos story, and Scott Klein and Marlene Kanagusuku from its customer loyalty team certainly delivered. A key thread in their presentation was how every employee is required to take four weeks of customer service training, and they are planning to cash in for the holiday season by bringing everyone from across the company in to man the phones and work with customers directly during that busiest time. 4. Get top-level buy-in through stories and data. (Citi) Frank Eliason became something of a rock star within the world of social customer care thanks to his work founding the @comcastcares Twitter account and helping to change that brand’s corporate culture. Now he’s got a unique point of view on how and why social media for customer service is a failure, and how brands can fix it. One of his main points was that you need to combine data with real powerful stories in order to actually make a change. As he shared, “I’ve never met a CEO who wanted to create a bad customer experience.” Amen. 5. Find your ROI formula to justify your own existence. (Xbox) Everyone has his own secret strategy for how to answer the big ROI question. But McKenzie Eakin, LIVE community programs manager for Xbox pulled back the curtain on her relatively simple formula: Unique customers engaged with Xbox on Twitter x The percent of people who say they would have called instead of tweeting x Average cost per call = saved in call center costs. It’s not a perfect methodology, but it’s all about finding the right lens through which to view data your company cares about. 6. Consider and leverage employees’ personal passions. (Best Buy) No discussion of scaling a social media for customer service effort would be complete without delving into the amazing work of Best Buy and its Twelpforce. All 180,000 of their employees are encouraged to use social media tools (a staggering number) and they have many training programs and content creation initiatives (like an in-house production studio). One important key — they let employees share their personal passions for technology and intersect those with their jobs. More companies should find a way to do this. 7. Don’t freak out. (Four Seasons) Earlier in the post, I started with a great customer service example from The Four Seasons hotels. While this tip itself was not something that Andrew Gillespie, Four Seasons’s manager of guest services, shared from the stage, it was an important reminder. Not every piece of negativity from a customer is bad news. Many times, it’s an opportunity to confound expectations, deliver something unexpected and completely turn that experience around. 8. Respond with empathy, but defend your brand. (Comcast) Kip Wetzel didn’t have an easy job when he became the new voice of the @comcastcares Twitter handle. At the conference, he talked about striking the right tone, how a human quality like empathy can be translated into 140 characters, and how engaging on social media doesn’t mean you need to let go of defending your brand. Be real and genuine and detailed, but also share the truth. 9. Don’t feed the trolls. (Samsung) In one of the final sessions of the day, Carla Saavedra from Samsung shared the important reminder that not everyone is worth engaging online. Some people are looking to pick a fight, get free stuff, or just get some attention on Twitter. Ignore those trolls and have a real strategic or customer-centric reason for responding to content online. This relates closely to the scaling topic because you can’t scale without prioritizing your responses.

The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country. Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmy's unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him. Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It's when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy's proposal of marriage to her! With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred, who's still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster. Jimmy's life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a \\"Valentine Day\\" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It's at Fred's circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn't have the heart to do, for him!

I'd like to take a minute of your time to highlight what we are doing to address all our concerns over our forecasts and how we are actively seeking to produce better results that we are all comfortable with and that provide useful insight and tradable information to our colleagues on the trading desks. As I am sure you know, forecasting the API's is not as scientific as other industry data such as the AGA's. The API is not consistently clear as to how it measures crude demand and this week's data is a clear example of this in that there is a discrepancy of 1.2 million b/d between crude runs and the demand figure shown by the API. Each week the basis of measuring crude demand changes slightly. To address this we are looking at finding ways of predicting what we call the API Curve Ball Factor through a variety of regressions / moving averages analysis. The second area we are in the process of perfecting is imports data. We are working closely with IT and Net Works to scrape real time shipping information in order to give us a better handle on crude coming in to the country. We are also recruiting a Quants PhD from Vince Kaminski's group who will be able to bring a slightly more scientific skill set to our team of business / economics skill sets. Please be assured that this issue is one we are giving the utmost priority to addressing.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

At the Los Angeles Rams’ season-opening home match at the Coliseum last weekend, at least 158 people were hospitalized for heat-related issues. (Temperatures were in the 90s.) But there was one huge difference: nobody died. Over the past 10 years there have been at least 25 drug-related deaths at parties hosted by just three LA-based rave promoters, the Los Angeles Times found. Parties such as Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) in Las Vegas have seen multiple drug-related deaths since moving there from the Coliseum in 2011. At Hard Summer this year, three patrons died. The cause is still under investigation. Last year two teenage girls died after attending Hard Summer. Both deaths were MDMA-related, coroner’s officials said. In the wake of these tragedies, and with a background of fewer venues willing to take risks on dance events, Hard announced it is not hosting its annual Day of the Dead festival in LA. Like in London, where one of the world’s greatest dance music venues, Fabric, appears to be no more due to factors triggered by the drug-related death of two teenagers in August, Los Angeles is in the midst of a rave crisis. Almost all of the city’s rave deaths are ecstasy-related, according to coroner’s conclusions. Yet for more than 20 years the electronic dance music scene has been blaming everything but itself – the media, “bad batch” pills, lack of party skills – for its drug problem. MDMA deaths have been constant here since the dawn of the 90s, when British ex-pats organized some of the first American raves in Los Angeles. In 1999 five teens died when the car they were in plunged off a mountain road following a rave(Ecstasy was one of the main drugs found in the victims’ bodies). Since those days the culture has returned to harm reduction as a means to combat the fatalities. DanceSafe, an organization that promotes health and safety within the electronic music community, believes ravers need a safe place to play where there’s plenty of free water, pill testing and space to cool down. Sounds reasonable. But pill testing, which has been embraced by some countries, can lead to a belief that ecstasy isn’t a cause in these deaths. Even the most celebrated MDMA scientists, such as the University of California Los Angeles’ Charles Grob, say ecstasy is problematic and unpredictable in a party setting. In the past five years there have been government task forces, free water, increased security and age limits of 18 and older. In the late 00s, operators of the San Francisco Bay Area’s Cow Palace tried harm reduction and found no improvement, with multiple hospitalizations. We’re fairly liberal in California. Marijuana is on the ballot this November and is likely to be fully legalized after 20 years of pioneering medical legitimacy. The so-called godfather of ecstasy, Sasha Shulgin, was a lifelong resident. We’re not opposed to fun. The important thing to acknowledge is that MDMA has a deadly record, like alcohol, heroin and cocaine. There are only two sure solutions when it comes to saving ravers’ lives: one, don’t hold raves. That’s not going to happen, and we don’t want it to. Two, make them 21 and older. None of the 25 deaths happened at 21-and-older events. Last year, following the 2015 deaths, Hard Day of the Dead went 21-plus. Nobody died. Of course, the crowds, estimated at 20,000, were fractional. Hard Summer saw about 147,000 people through the turnstiles this year. Yes, some of the deceased over the years have been older than 21, but barely. When 20-year-old Kenani Kaimuloa died after attending EDC Vegas this year, her father, an Iraq combat veteran, told a local newspaper reporter that he had been waiting for her to come home that weekend “to give me her Father’s Day present”.

The article highlights the importance of acknowledging the deadly record of MDMA and suggests that one potential solution for reducing drug-related deaths at these events is to make them 21-and-older only.

It's important that a cat not feel trapped or threatened, so don't corner it in a room. Just leaving a door open a crack so the cat knows it can run if it needs to can help soothe an anxious animal. When approaching a nervous cat, go slow, and give it ample time to adjust to your presence and your scent. If your cat does run out of the room, don't chase it. That will only increase its anxiety. Make sure to warn children and guests to give your cat space, and to not try to force it to be sociable. Clean up any cat spray that might be in the home using a specially-formulated cleaner. If a neighbor cat is lurking outside a particular window or sliding glass door, use opaque contact paper or cardboard to cover the window so your cat can't see the intruder. If your cat is an indoor animal, you can use cayenne pepper or a specially formulated cat repellent around the perimeter of your yard to try to keep other cats from intruding. If your cat is stressed out by a new baby or pet, time will often help, but you can further assist your cat by providing him with ample resources and places to hide. Make sure the cat has at least one place to perch that will keep him out of reach from any would-be pesterers, like a tall climbing post or kitty shelf. If you have more than one cat, make sure that there are enough litter boxes, food dishes, and water bowls for everyone. Cats are much happier when they don't have to share. Spend more time playing with your cat, and try introducing new ways to stimulate him. Hide little treats around the house where your cat can find them, and never underestimate the therapeutic power of catnip. There are a number of products on the market that help soothe stressed cats by releasing soothing pheromones into the air. Check with your vet or local pet store for a specific recommendation. These products can be pricey, but they may be worth it. If you still can't figure out how what's bothering your cat, or how to fix it, have your pet checked out by the vet.

Trudeau took a big step to ease that acquaintance already. Trudeau’s aides reached out to Trump’s team and pitched an event that jibes with the prime minister’s emphasis on “women in the workplace” and Ivanka Trump’s commitment to advance women’s issues like child care and maternity leave in the workplace. Well, there’s a new guy in town now and the Canadians are working to take his measure on Monday, adjust their agenda and come to terms with the political phenomenon known as Donald Trump. There was pomp and ceremony on the front lawn, gracious toasts at a state dinner and Trudeau and the Canadian delegation basked in the welcome laid on by President Barack Obama last March. “That’s another world. That world is not here right now so you have to deal with a different world,” said former diplomat Paul Frazer. It is potentially a good sign for a visit that will look very different than the very warm reception Trudeau got from the Obamas in March. A PMO official said Trudeau had similarly advocated for the advancement of women in the workplace, especially at the executive level in China, in New York and at home and “is looking forward to being able to do this now in the White House. It seemed like a natural fit given their commitments” in Trump’s platform as well. Frazer says no other government has better prepared for the Trump administration than Canada , reaching out even before last November’s U.S. election to forge ties with his advisers in the possibility — though rare as it seemed back then — he might win. But that doesn’t mean this new reality is necessarily bad for Canada, he said. Justin Trudeau says when he meets with Donald Trump on Monday he expects to talk mostly about issues the U.S. and Canada \\"align on,\\" but the prime minister says he won't avoid subjects he disagrees on with the U.S. president. More recently, Trudeau shuffled his cabinet, dispatching foreign affairs minister Stéphane Dion to a diplomatic posting and installing Chrystia Freeland in his place, making retired army general Andrew Leslie a parliamentary secretary with special responsibility for cross-border ties and changing staff behind the scenes, all to put greater emphasis on Canada’s relations with the United States. Freeland will join Trudeau on his Monday trip to Washington, along with Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, Transport Minister Marc Garneau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau. “He’s done an enormous amount to get ready for this,” said Frazer, a former Canadian diplomat who now serves as a consultant in Washington. All that has laid the groundwork for Trudeau’s Oval Office tête-à-tête with Trump. In the “bloody chaotic town” that is Washington right now, the Monday meeting offers a respite for the Trump team to latch onto something that “actually works,” Frazer said. “Weeks into this rock and roll administration, I think the president is probably open to a little calm,” he said. Frazer’s advice? Don’t walk in with a list of grievances or complaints about Trump’s policies, such as his controversial immigration moves, at least not for the first meeting. Lay out the argument that keeping the border open and avoiding protectionist measures will help the economy and help boost the financial fortunes of the middle class in both countries. “Lay it out quickly. We don’t need long detailed policy memos here,” Frazer said. “Here’s what we’ve got and it’s better than anything else in the world and how do we make it better. Let’s not do anything to screw it up,” he said. “(Trump) responds well to facts, to a businesslike approach, kind of a roll-up-our-sleeves, ‘what is it you want, what is it I want,’ ” Frazer said. Trudeau suggested Friday that’s the very angle he’ll be taking when he sits down with Trump. “Relations between Canada and the United States are much deeper than just what is happening between a president and a prime minister. Obviously we’ll talk about jobs and growth for the middle class and we’ll find a lot of common ground,” the prime minister said during a visit to Yellowknife last week. Both sides have been working on “deliverables” for the meeting, concrete commitments they can point to as evidence that the two leaders did more than just talk. But for a first meeting, talk is important, too, especially as Trump’s early days in office have already left some world leaders unsettled, especially by his treatment of allies. The U.S. president drew fire for giving short shrift to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in a telephone call. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped his own White House visit in the continuing dispute over paying the cost of a wall along their shared border. But Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, got a warm reception when he met with Trump Friday at the White House. Abe had met once before with Trump, travelling to his New York apartment for a pre-inauguration visit with the incoming president. Trump declared Friday that he has a “good chemistry” with the Japanese leader. “I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that’s the way we feel. We have a very, very good bond,” he said, adding, “I’ll let you know if it changes.” During his joint news conference with Abe, Trump touched on themes that should encourage Canadians getting ready for their own meeting. He highlighted the importance of working together with Japan on “shared interests, of which we have many.” “We face numerous challenges and bilateral co-operation is essential. Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner,” Trump said. “We’re going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan,” the president said. That kind of language bolds well for Trudeau’s visit, who will be looking to tap similar sentiments with Trump and his cabinet team. And as one of the first leaders in to see the U.S. president, others on the world stage will be looking to Trudeau for his impressions and advice — lessons he will be able to impart later in the week when he travels to Germany and France to meet with European politicians. “What great timing for the Europeans to see him after he’s had his personal meeting with Trump and quietly give them a personal sense of what’s his takeaway,” Frazer said. ||||| FILE - In this Nov. 29, 2016 file photo, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a press conference at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario.

On Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, President Donald Trump... (Associated Press) OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump will participate in a roundtable discussion about women in the work force Monday, an early sign of cooperation as Trudeau seeks to have good relations so Canada is not targeted in trade talks. In his first face-to-face meeting with the new U.S president, Trudeau will also meet with Trump to talk about trade and participate in a working lunch. A White House official and a senior Canadian government official said the two countries plan to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. The officials agreed to confirm the move only if they were not quoted by name because they were not authorized to make the information public. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter who has been an advocate for policies benefiting working women, was involved in recruiting participants and setting the agenda for the roundtable. Female executives from the United States and Canada are expected to participate. Trudeau's close cooperation with Trump and the first daughter could ease some worries among Canadians that the U.S. president will enact protectionist measures that could hurt the Canadian economy. It could also alleviate some fears that Trump will be as combative with Trudeau as he has been with the leaders of Mexico and Australia. The Canadian official said Trudeau's administration had suggested the task force, because the prime minister considers the issue of working women an important part of his agenda and economic growth plan. \\"It's a smart thing if Canada proposed this,\\" said Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto. \\"It takes attention off of NAFTA. And from Trump's point of view, it contributes to softening Trump's image, and he's got a problem with women.\\" Trudeau, 45, and Trump, 70, are polar opposites. Trudeau is a liberal who champions free trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees. He calls himself a feminist and his Cabinet is 50 percent women. Trump has few women in his Cabinet. He has taken a protectionist stance on trade and wants to crack down on the inflow of migrants and refugees. Trump's order to temporarily halt entry into the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim nations, which is tied up in court, might come up during his bilateral meeting with Trudeau. But Trudeau is expected to focus on common economic interests. Relations with the U.S. are crucial as more than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S., while 18 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada. There are fears among Canadians that they could be hurt as Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Roland Paris, a former senior foreign policy to Trudeau, said the prime minister needs to build a relationship with Trump to ensure Canada is not. \\"The overriding priority will be for Canada to maintain secure and reliable access to the U.S. market and the supply chains that crisscross the border,\\" Paris said. Trudeau, whose father was the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has been preparing for the Trump meeting for months. He will also meet with legislative leaders on Capitol Hill. ___ Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report. |||||","response":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Donald Trump are set to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs.

Thomas Durante. Last updated at 9:06 AM on 11th October 2011. A Wisconsin woman who already had three children and was desperate to have one with her new boyfriend was today charged with killing a pregnant mother, cutting out her baby and passing off the child as her own. The criminal complaint filed today details the horrific story behind the murder of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, who was expecting her fourth child that she had planned to name Omar. Her alleged killer, Annette Morales-Rodriguez, admitted she. had scoured the suburban Milwaukee neighbourhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant. woman whose child she could steal and call her own. Scroll down for video. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday. On October 6, she saw Maritza Ramirez-Cruz - a total stranger - and offered her a ride. When. she got in the car, however, Morales-Rodriguez said she needed to go. back to her home to change her shoes, and Ramirez-Cruz followed her in. to use the bathroom. It. was when she came out of the toilet that Morales-Rodriguez allegedly attacked her. with a baseball bat, striking her in the head several times. With. Ramirez-Cruz on the ground, her attacker choked her until she. passed out, and cut her open, attempting a Cesaerean section that she. had seen done on the Discovery Channel, according to the complaint. Suspect: Annette Morales-Rodriguez is accused of murdering Maritza Ramirez-Cruz then savagely cutting out her unborn child. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, bottom left, had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday. Morales-Rodriguez then hid the body in her basement. Later that evening, emergency services responded to a. call from Morales-Rodriguez, who said that she had. just given birth to a child who was not breathing, according to the. criminal complaint. Indicted: Annette Morales-Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Paramedics were unable to revive the boy and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Morales-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital but,. after an autopsy of the full-term baby - and medical examinations of the. woman herself, it was determined that she was not pregnant and had not recently given birth. Police Chief Edward Flynn said: 'During. the ensuing investigations, detectives determined that the 33-year-old. woman was not, in fact, the birth mother of the baby.' The next day, police returned to Morales-Rodriguez's home and found Ramirez-Cruz's mutilated body. The medical examiner determined that Ramirez-Cruz likely died from excessive loss of blood. Local residents and neighbours have. been shocked by the brutal killing, and many cannot believe police have. the right person in custody. On Sunday night, the victim's husband, Christian Mercado, told WTMJ that his wife was a 'good person.' Because he doesn't speak English, Mr Mercado's stepmother Darla Guiterrez translated for him. She said: 'We still can't believe it. We know it's true but we can't believe it and the whole family is taking it real hard.' Jacqueline Bonilla, whose daughter lives next-door to Morales-Rodriguez, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: 'She was acting like she was [pregnant]. Grief: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz's husband Christian Mercado is shocked by her death, and says she was a 'good person' 'She'd push her belly out and I'd say, \\"Oh, she's pregnant.\\"' Another neighbour, Keila Perez, claimed the Morales-Rodriguez is the godmother to her daughter. 'From what I know she had a baby, she had baby stuff in there, she has a car seat and everything in there. I don't know what the hell is going on.' Morales-Rodriguez lived in the property with a man and her three children, but police said no-one else is being considered as an accomplice. Neighbours said Morales-Rodriguez claimed to have been pregnant for months. Police tape: The home where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lived in suburban Milwaukee remains blocked off after police found the body of 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz in the basement. Crime scene: The house near 7th and Mitchell streets, where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lives with her boyfriend and three children. Ms Perez said Morales-Rodriguez had been talking about pregnancy, and had even shown her a sonogram of the baby. She claimed she was expecting to deliver the baby by Caesarean section in the coming weeks but had called Ms Perez around noon on Thursday to say she was having contractions. She said the woman's three other children ranged in age from five to 14, and her current boyfriend was not their father. She added that Morales-Rodriguez had lived in the neighbourhood for seven years, after moving from Puerto Rico. Similar cases of women taking an unborn child from a mother's womb were reported in Massachusetts and Oregon in 2009, in Pennsylvania in 2007, in Illinois in 2006 and Missouri in 2004. In the Oregon case, a woman obsessed with having a baby pleaded guilty last year to the murder of a pregnant woman whose unborn child was cut from her abdomen after she was bludgeoned to death. Korena Roberts, 29, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In Massachusetts, a Worcester woman, Julie Corey, pleaded not guilty to killing her pregnant friend, Darlene Hayes, and cutting the baby from Hayes' womb. Corey and the baby were found in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H., in July 2009, just days after Hayes was found dead with a fractured skull. Disbelief: Shocked neighbours say the suspect lives with three of her children in the house where the body was found.","response":"A shocking case has emerged from Wisconsin, where a woman, Annette Morales-Rodriguez, has been charged with killing a pregnant mother, Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, and stealing her unborn child.

A minister yesterday admitted that the plan to serve free hot meals to all young children in primary schools from September was going to fail. David Laws, the Liberal Democrat second-in-command at the Department for Education, said some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot. He admitted not everything would be ‘perfect on day one’ as schools battle to implement Nick Clegg’s flagship plan to offer four to seven-year-olds free lunches from September. David Laws admitted not everything would be 'perfect on day one' as schools battle to implement Nick Clegg¿s flagship plan to offer four to seven-year-olds free lunches from September. It suggests some schools will take weeks or months, if not longer, to offer all eligible pupils hot meals. Mr Laws also disclosed that extra funding to help small schools implement the policy may need to continue for ‘years’. The Mail disclosed this week that tens of thousands of pupils will be served reheated meals or cold sandwiches from September because schools lack proper kitchens and cannot afford them. More than 3,000 primaries – about one in five – will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens. Dozens of others will offer only cold lunches, in some cases at pupils’ desks. But many of these are unlikely to meet rules on nutritional content that schools must follow. Mr Law’s comments, in a speech to school caterers in Birmingham yesterday, represented the first time that the Government had admitted the scale of the problem. David Laws said that some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot. He said: ‘Some schools will provide a cold meal initially, until capital works are complete. In the medium term we expect all schools to be giving a hot food option – which is what is really necessary to meet the school food standards consistently.’ The Liberal Democrats insisted that ‘medium term’ meant weeks but research for the Mail suggests renovation works at some schools will take considerably longer. Mr Laws also said that many schools were ‘raising their sights’ above transporting in pre-prepared meals and wanted their own kitchens. He said the Government intended to consider what it could do to ‘support schools further in creating the right facilities and environment to maximise the quality of food’. But he added: ‘It would be unrealistic to think that in just one year we could rebuild the entire school estate and reverse decades of neglect in some areas.’ And he insisted: ‘I was not willing to allow the search for perfection to get in the way of delivering a step change in healthy eating which is needed right now.’ Mr Clegg used his speech to last year’s Liberal Democrat conference to demand a ‘hot, healthy lunch’ for infant school pupils every day. Following warnings from head teachers, references to ‘hot’ were quietly dropped from legislation published earlier this year, which simply requires that food be ‘nutritious’. The policy has provoked one of the fiercest bouts of in-fighting within the Coalition since power-sharing began in 2010. More than 3,000 primaries - about one in five - will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens.

Step 3: Capture the Police Response and Investigation As a result of the shootings, the NYPD immediately launched an investigation to apprehend those responsible for the attack on their fellow officers. Through diligent and swift action, law enforcement authorities managed to apprehend and arrest two men in connection with the incident. An additional suspect has been taken into custody for further questioning. Step 4: Highlight the Charges and Legal Proceedings The two arrested men, whose names have not been released, are likely to be charged with a range of offenses relating to the armed robbery and the subsequent shooting of the NYPD officers. The legal proceedings are expected to commence soon, as the authorities aim to bring the perpetrators to justice swiftly. Conclusion: The shooting of NYPD officers Andrew Dossi and Aliro Pellerano serves as a stark reminder of the dangers law enforcement personnel face daily while performing their duties. With two men arrested and another in custody, the NYPD's efforts to bring the suspects to justice are well underway. As for the wounded officers, the community remains hopeful for their speedy recovery and eventual return to active duty."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

This happened while the Soviets were still negotiating with the British and French missions in Moscow. With the Western nations unwilling to accede to Soviet demands, Stalin instead entered a secret Nazi–Soviet pact. On 24 August a 10-year non-aggression pact was signed with provisions that included: consultation, arbitration if either party disagreed, neutrality if either went to war against a third power, no membership of a group \\"which is directly or indirectly aimed at the other\\".

A long time ago, there were two big countries, Germany and the Soviet Union.

In this pact, they promised not to fight each other and to help each other in certain ways. However, they kept some parts of this pact secret from everyone else. Imagine it like playing a game with your friends but not telling them all the rules you agreed on with your other friend. Now, you asked a question that is a bit confusing, but I think you are wondering when the Germans and Soviets agreed to leave out neutral or friendly talks. It's a bit tough to answer that question because the secret pact they signed didn't specifically say when they couldn't have friendly talks with others. It just talked about how these two countries would behave towards each other and how they wouldn't join any groups that were against each other.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Why is stream of consciousness used as a literary technique? Answer: Stream of consciousness is a literary technique used by writers to represent a character's thoughts, feelings, and perceptions in a continuous and often chaotic flow, rather than through a more organized or linear narrative. This approach provides a closer approximation to how the human mind works, granting readers a more intimate and realistic portrayal of a character's inner world. Rationale: The term \\"stream of consciousness\\" was coined by American philosopher and psychologist William James in his 1890 book, \\"The Principles of Psychology.\\" It refers to the continuous and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and experiences that occur in an individual's mind. As a literary technique, stream of consciousness has been employed by several prominent authors, including James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Marcel Proust. By using this technique, writers aim to provide a more authentic representation of the human experience—showcasing not only the character's thoughts and feelings but also demonstrating how these thoughts and feelings influence one another and evolve over time. Usage in a Sentence: The stream of consciousness technique helps to vividly portray a character's inner conflict, as shown in this sentence: \\"One can be either behind a sedan or crashed into a sign.\\" In this example, the character's thoughts jump from one idea to the next, illustrating their thought process in a realistic and relatable way. The disjointed nature of the thoughts reflects the inner turmoil the character may be experiencing. In conclusion, the stream of consciousness is a valuable literary tool that can offer readers a deeper understanding of a character's mindset and emotional landscape. By presenting thoughts and feelings in a nonlinear, fluid manner, this technique effectively captures the complexities of the human experience."},{"question":"Q:Article: Japanese people work very hard at studying English.

Virginia Roberts, who now goes by the name Virginia Giuffre, was a regular customer at the local bottle shop where Sue Evrard worked. She described her as a pleasant woman who was always polite and friendly. “She was lovely, a fabulous mum and great with her kids,” Evrard added. People in the community were shocked by the revelations as Roberts had always maintained a modest low-profile. She was often seen walking her dog or with her children on the way to the local school, presenting the image of a caring mother and providing no inkling about the alleged involvement in such a high-profile international scandal. The quiet streets of Glenning Valley, a peaceful residential area peppered with gum trees and colourful birdlife, were shaken by this horrifying news. The allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse involving one of their own had a profound impact on the close-knit neighborhood, stirring feelings of bewilderment, confusion, and sympathy. Here was a woman who, on the surface, appeared to be a regular, caring mother, allegedly entangled in an international scandal involving a British royal and a Wall Street financier. Eleanor Bennett, a retired school teacher living a few houses down from where Roberts once resided, echoed the sentiments of many residents when she said, \\"We never had any idea. It's shocking to hear this news about someone you see every day, just going about their normal life. She always seemed to be quite, well, normal.\\" As local and international media began converging on the formerly quiet neighborhood, residents were left to grapple with the emotional fallout and feelings of disbelief. Headlines and breaking news updates only served to deepen the shock and confusion among residents, who were suddenly thrust into the world's scrutiny. The aftermath of these revelations has left the town in a state of unexpected tension and profound sadness. Questions without answers and a newfound distrust hover over the quiet suburb, as residents struggle to reconcile the news with the woman they fondly knew as just a neighbour, a friend, and a mother. Although some might find it hard to believe, many in the community still stand by Virginia Roberts, insisting the woman they got to know over the years was considerate, accountable and respectful. With events ongoing and the full story yet to be completely unravelled, the Glenning Valley community is leaning on its inherent strength and unity to endure this trying period while seeking to maintain some semblance of normality in their everyday lives."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: In Billings, Montana, a police officer arrives and discovers Woody Grant walking on the shoulder of the roadway. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions.

Can you fix that?","response":"Infrared Remote Control for End Users is Applicable for the Master Versions of the Following Detectors: Infrared remote controls are a widely-used technology, particularly in consumer electronics, as they offer a convenient way for end users to operate various devices. An infrared remote control sends signals to a receiver via a series of invisible light pulses. This method allows the remote control to communicate with several types of detectors. In the context you have provided, it appears that the infrared remote control you're referring to is intended for use with various master versions of detectors. After revising the sentence into proper sentence case and capitalizing the appropriate terms, here is the corrected version: Infrared Remote Control for End Users is Applicable for the Master Versions of the Following Detectors: Unfortunately, you did not provide the list of detectors that are compatible with this particular infrared remote control. However, to give you a more detailed and long answer, I will discuss common types of detectors that may come with an infrared remote control system. 1. Smoke Detectors: These devices detect the presence of smoke, which is typically an indicator of a fire. With an infrared remote control, users can easily test the functionality of their smoke detectors, reset them after an alarm, and control other aspects of the device. 2. Gas Detectors: Gas detectors monitor and detect different types of harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, natural gas, or propane. An infrared remote control allows end users to control and monitor the gas level, reset the device, or change various settings. 3. Motion Detectors: Motion detectors are commonly used to activate lighting, intruder alarms, or other systems based on the detection of moving objects. By using an infrared remote control, end users can adjust the sensitivity levels, reset the system, or switch the detector on and off. 4. Radon Detectors: Radon gas is a radioactive substance commonly found in the ground. When it seeps into a building and accumulates at dangerous levels, it can pose a serious health risk. With an infrared remote control, users have the ability to monitor radon levels and control certain aspects of the detector like resetting alarms or adjusting settings. 5. Intrusion Detection Systems: These systems are designed to detect unauthorized access to a property. By incorporating infrared remote controls, end users can arm or disarm the system, adjust the sensors, and receive notifications regarding any security breaches. While it is impossible to determine the specific master versions of detectors your infrared remote control is compatible with, these examples give you an indication of the types of devices that could potentially use such a technology. It is important to consult the manufacturer or the specific detector's manual to confirm compatibility with the infrared remote control in question."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Do the following sentences say the same thing?

The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos. - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator ( ) of Changsha ( ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders . - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD). - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved. - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han. - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty. - Cao Cao (155 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals. - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history. - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing. - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang. - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors. - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han founded by Liu Bei in 221 in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. - Liu Bei (161 10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu. - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class. - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong.

Bản tin của VTV24 dẫn lại một số ý kiến khen ngợi chương trình của họ, và khẳng định: \\"Những đồng nghiệp, những khán giả, độc giả chân chính đã lên tiếng ủng hộ, động viên, giúp chúng tôi càng vững vàng hơn trên con đường đưa cái xấu ra ánh sáng.\\" Bản tin này phỏng vấn ông Nguyễn Thắng Cảnh, được giới thiệu là hội viên Hội Nhà báo Việt Nam \\"theo dõi sát\\" câu chuyện, nói rằng đã có sự \\"xuyên tạc ra là thuê người đó để đi phá rừng để quay phim, hết sức tưởng tượng, không đúng\\". Ông Cảnh ca ngợi VTV24 đã quay được tư liệu \\"rất quý, rất hiếm\\". Bản tin của VTV24 nêu tên Người Lao Động Online và \\"một số báo mạng, trang thông tin điện tử\\" đã đăng bài mà VTV24 nói khiến \\"dư luận bị định hướng sai, hiểu nhầm VTV dàn dựng phóng sự\\". Trang mạng báo Người Lao Động ngày 5/8 đề cập Văn bản số 565 ngày 27/7 của công an tỉnh Đắk Lắk gửi cho Sở TT-TT và lãnh đạo UBND tỉnh Đắk Lắk về việc trao đổi kết quả xác minh theo nội dung phóng sự của VTV. Tờ báo đăng lại văn bản của công an, trong đó nói: \\"Qua điều tra xác minh thông tin phóng sự nêu trên nhận thấy có một số nội dung phản ánh không đúng, không khách quan và có sự cắt ghép, dàn dựng của phóng viên khi tác nghiệp.\\" Báo Người Lao Động tường thuật “nhiều nội dung trong phóng sự là đúng sự thật” nhưng cũng dẫn lời ông Trần Trung Hiển, Giám đốc Sở Thông tin - Truyền thông Đắk Lắk cho hay: “Có những nội dung không đúng và không khách quan mà văn bản của Công an tỉnh Đắk Lắk nêu rất rõ”. Trước đó, trong thông cáo gửi đến BBC, Trung tâm Tin tức VTV24 dẫn lời ông Nguyễn Tuấn Hà, Phó chủ tịch Ủy ban Nhân dân tỉnh Đắk Lắk nói: “[Sự việc] VTV đưa tin là hoàn toàn có chứ không phải không. Ông Thắng [Phó Giám đốc Công an tỉnh] nói trong trong báo cáo trên cơ sở thẩm tra ban đầu và không có từ nào nói rằng [phóng sự của VTV24] là dàn dựng cả”. Ông Hà cũng được VTV dẫn lời nói chính quyền 'đánh giá cao' phóng sự về nạn phá rừng, trái ngược hẳn thông tin ban đầu. Hôm 5/8, báo Công an TP. HCM đăng bài nói: \\"Việc VTV có dàn dựng hình ảnh một đoạn phóng sự hay không? Vì mục đích gì? Việc này đang được điều tra làm rõ.\\" Tờ này cho biết vào sáng 5/8, Thiếu tướng Trần Kỳ Rơi, Giám đốc Công an tỉnh Đắk Lắk, tuyên bố đang \\"khẩn trương làm rõ để báo cáo Bộ Công an theo chỉ đạo\\". Summary:","response":"On August 5th, Vietnam Television (VTV) released a video to demonstrate that the reporters \\"gave money to help people in difficult circumstances\\" rather than \\"hiring people to stage a report on deforestation,\\" as previously accused. The issue revolves around an investigative report on illegal logging and transportation in Đắk Lắk province, which was aired on VTV1 in May. The report series was rebroadcast on VTV24 in August for viewers to reevaluate the content and the work process of the VTV24 reporters. In the video, a VTV24 reporter is shown giving VND 500,000 to a woman in Đắk Lắk who suffers from domestic violence and has children at risk of dropping out of school. The VTV24 news also quotes opinions supporting their program and confirms that their colleagues and audience members have supported and encouraged them in this matter. The report also interviews Mr. Nguyen Thang Canh, a member of the Vietnam Journalists Association, who states that the claim of hiring people for staging deforestation was \\"unimaginable, untrue.\\""},{"question":"If \\"A man in a black shirt is doing skateboard tricks for a small crowd.\\" does that mean that \\"The man is performing at the skate park.\\"?

However, upon analyzing the elements within it, it appears that the sentiment leans slightly more towards the negative side. Let's dissect the phrase to understand this better: 1. \\"from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie\\": Here, Juliette Lewis is being described as a \\"former nymphette,\\" indicating that she once had a more youthful and potentially sexually appealing persona. By casting her as a \\"salt-of-the-earth mommy,\\" it suggests that this character may not be as glamorous or exciting as her previous roles. While this may not be overtly negative, it does seem to downplay the appeal of Lewis's role in this instance. 2. \\"watching slim travel incognito\\": This portion of the phrase does not carry a significant positive or negative connotation. Rather, it simply provides context about the plot, mentioning that the character \\"Slim\\" is traveling incognito. 3. \\"in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell\\": This part of the phrase is more obviously negative, as it describes the wig as \\"ridiculous\\" and implies that it is of such poor quality that even a \\"respectable Halloween costume shop\\" would refuse to sell it. This demonstrates a level of ridicule or mockery directed at the character and their choice of disguise. In conclusion, there are more negative elements found within this phrase than positive ones. The potentially derogatory description of Juliette Lewis's character and the overt criticism of Slim's disguise contribute to an overall negative tone. While not overwhelmingly negative, it definitely leans more towards the negative side when evaluating the sentiment of the phrase."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

David Miliband was educated at Primrose Hill Primary School , in Leeds , and Newlaithes Primary School , in Camden . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other as they convey the same information using different word order and structure. Both sentences provide information about David Miliband's educational background, specifically mentioning the two primary schools he attended: Primrose Hill Primary School in Camden and Newlaithes Primary School in Leeds. The main difference between them is the order in which the schools' names and their locations are presented. In the first sentence, the structure is as follows: The subject, David Miliband, is followed by the institutions and their corresponding locations: Primrose Hill Primary School in Camden and Newlaithes Primary School in Leeds. 1. David Miliband was trained at the Primrose Hill Primary School in Camden and Newlaithes Primary School in Leeds. In the second sentence, the structure has been rearranged, presenting the schools with their cities in different orders. The subject, David Miliband, is followed by the schools and locations, but each school is mentioned within a separate structure: Primrose Hill Primary School in Leeds and Newlaithes Primary School in Camden. 2. David Miliband was educated at Primrose Hill Primary School, in Leeds, and Newlaithes Primary School, in Camden. Despite the differences in syntax, the core message remains the same—David Miliband attended two primary schools, Primrose Hill Primary School and Newlaithes Primary School, located in Camden and Leeds, respectively. It is important to note that the information regarding the locations of the schools is switched between the two sentences, resulting in a minor contradiction. Nevertheless, the sentences are still considered paraphrases of one another as they convey similar information about David Miliband's primary education."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"After the continential championships what happens?\\" Context: \\"After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams.

The collection contains themes presented in his earlier collections, though the tone of the poems caused critics to suggest the book is darker and more \\"socially engaged\\" than his earlier volumes. It is currently on the AQA AS/A2 level English Literature syllabus. - \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\" is a poem in the form of a villanelle, and the most famous work of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (19141953).

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine.

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Question: suppose more hyphal knots form in the ground happens, how will it affect the earth will get warmer. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"If more hyphal knots form in the ground, it can have various potential impacts on the Earth's warming, although the direct relationship between hyphal knots and an increase or decrease in global temperature is not as straightforward as choosing one answer from options A, B, or C. Hyphal knots are the early stages of primordia (pins) development in fungi. Fungi play a significant role in the breakdown and recycling of organic material in ecosystems, including the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which can contribute to global warming. The decomposition process of fungi transforms complex organic materials into simple compounds, releasing nutrients and energy that are essential for sustaining life forms in ecosystems. When more hyphal knots form in the ground, certain factors need to be considered to examine the potential effect on the Earth's warming: 1. Type of fungi: Different fungi species have unique metabolic processes that lead to different rates of greenhouse gas production and consumption. Some fungi may produce more gases, contributing to an increase in the greenhouse effect (Answer A: more), while others may have a lower or neutral impact on gas release (Answer C: no effect). 2. Carbon sequestration: Fungal mycelium can promote the formation of stable soil aggregates, which enhance carbon storage in the soil. This process, known as carbon sequestration, can help mitigate climate change by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. An increase in hyphal knots could potentially lead to more carbon sequestration, resulting in a reduced rate of global warming (Answer B: less). 3. Interaction with plants: Fungi often form mutualistic relationships with plants, such as mycorrhizal associations. These relationships can improve plant growth and increase the plants' capacity to capture CO2 through photosynthesis. More hyphal knots could potentially amplify this effect, again potentially reducing the rate of global warming (Answer B: less). However, the impact of this relationship depends on the plant species and local environmental conditions. 4. Changes in ecosystems: An increase in hyphal knots may alter the balance of greenhouse gas release and uptake in an ecosystem, depending on which species are dominant and their respective roles in the carbon cycle. If a net decrease in greenhouse gas production or an increase in sequestration occurs, then it may lead to less earth warming (Answer B: less). In contrast, if a net increase in greenhouse gas production occurs, this may result in more earth warming (Answer A: more). In conclusion, whether more hyphal knots form in the ground will affect the Earth's warming depends on various factors, including the type of fungi involved, carbon sequestration potential, interaction with plants, and changes in ecosystems. It is not possible to provide a simplified answer without more information on these factors."},{"question":"Q: What would be problematic for a multilingual character set or font to provide? A: In other words, while the shapes of letters like A, B, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X, Y and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely typographical nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a single codepoint for, say, uppercase letter B, as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, b (Latin), β (Greek), or в (Cyrillic). Does the answer correctly answer the question (i) yes; (ii) no;","response":"A multilingual character set or font might encounter several problems in providing a seamless experience to its users. Here are some of the issues: 1. Number of characters: The sheer number of characters, symbols, and scripts that a multilingual character set or font has to support presents a logistical challenge. It has to incorporate the scripts of dozens of languages, which can include thousands of individual characters and glyphs. 2. Compatibility with various systems: A multilingual font must be compatible with multiple software applications, operating systems, and devices. Ensuring a smooth and uniform experience across all these platforms can be challenging. 3. Variation within a single language: Many languages have regional variations and dialects, which may require different characters or glyphs. A multilingual character set must accommodate these variations to ensure clarity and accuracy in communication. 4. Right-to-left (RTL) languages: Some languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian, are written right-to-left. This requires multilingual fonts to support RTL fonts and ensure compatibility with LTR (left-to-right) languages. 5. Accurate rendering of complex scripts: Some languages have complex scripts with rules for character formation and positioning. These rules must be known and implemented correctly in the font to display the text correctly. 6. Distinguishing similar characters: As mentioned in the question, there are characters that appear similar across multiple scripts but have different meanings and pronunciations. A multilingual font should provide unique codepoints for each character while maintaining visual consistency. 7. Legibility and readability: A multilingual font must combine characters from different languages in a way that is both visually pleasing and understandable for readers. Striking this balance can be challenging given the variety of scripts, shapes, and styles. 8. Cultural sensitivity: Different cultures have different requirements for how letters and symbols should appear in print. A multilingual font must be sensitive to these preferences to ensure that it does not inadvertently offend or alienate users. 9. Cost and time constraints: Developing a comprehensive multilingual font can be time-consuming and expensive. Creating and maintaining such a font requires the commitment of designers and developers, who may be working on a limited budget or deadline. 10. Licensing and intellectual property issues: Designers and developers must ensure that their multilingual font adheres to the appropriate copyrights, trademarks, and licenses to prevent future legal disputes. In conclusion, challenges arise from the complexity of managing thousands of characters and glyphs, ensuring platform compatibility, adapting to variations in languages, and providing an accurate and appropriate representation of each language. Despite these challenges, multilingual character sets and fonts contribute significantly to global communication and intercultural understanding."},{"question":"Q: How many ways did the Vedantins have of gaining knowledge? A: Each of these have been further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by each sub-school of Vedanta. Does the answer correctly answer the question","response":"A: Yes, the answer provided gives a detailed explanation of the ways Vedantins have of gaining knowledge. To reiterate and expand on the answer: The Vedanta school of Indian philosophy has been a significant and influential tradition, with its focus on gaining knowledge through various methods. Vedantins classified these methods into 'Pramanas,' which are considered as reliable and valid means to acquire knowledge. According to Vedantic thought, there are six primary Pramanas. 1. Pratyaksha (Perception): Pratyaksha Pramana refers to the knowledge gained through direct perception, which involves the use of one's senses, such as seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling. This method is based on the direct experience of an object or event and is considered as the most reliable source of knowledge in the Vedanta tradition. 2. Anumana (Inference): Anumana Pramana is the process of gaining knowledge through reasoning and logical analysis. It involves deducing a conclusion by considering known facts, observations, or premises. For example, if we see smoke in the distance, we infer that there is a fire. The ability to reason and infer is considered an essential tool in acquiring knowledge within Vedantic philosophy. 3. Upamana (Comparison and analogy): Upamana Pramana involves learning and understanding through comparison and analogy. By drawing similarities and differences between known and unknown objects, this method allows the acquisition of knowledge derived from their common characteristics or attributes. 4. Arthapatti (Presumption): Arthapatti Pramana refers to gaining knowledge through certain presumptions or assumptions that are considered necessary to explain a given situation or phenomena. For instance, if a person is seen to be healthy and well-nourished despite not eating during daylight hours, it is presumed that they must be eating at night. 5. Anupalabdhi (Non-perception or negative/cognitive proof): Anupalabdhi Pramana involves obtaining knowledge through negative proof or the absence of perception. This means that when something cannot be perceived, its non-existence is established. For example, by noticing the absence of a person in a certain place, we can infer that they are not there. 6. Sabda (Verbal testimony): Sabda Pramana refers to the acquisition of knowledge through the reliable and authoritative words or statements of others. In the context of Vedanta, the most significant source of verbal testimony is the sacred texts like the Vedas and Upanishads since they are believed to be revealed truths. Furthermore, as mentioned in the initial answer, each sub-school of Vedanta further categorizes these Pramanas concerning conditionality, completeness, confidence, and the possibility of error to refine and adapt the methods for their specific philosophical frameworks. In conclusion, there are six primary ways for gaining knowledge in the Vedanta tradition, and they include Pratyaksha (Perception), Anumana (Inference), Upamana (Comparison and analogy), Arthapatti (Presumption), Anupalabdhi (Non-perception), and Sabda (Verbal testimony). These ways are meant to guide individuals toward the ultimate truths and depths of self-realization and spiritual understanding."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: In which quarter did neither team score?","response":"Title: A Game of Surprises: The Quarter when Neither Team Scored Introduction: In sports like basketball, football, or soccer, high-scoring events often captivate audiences and create memorable moments. However, sometimes, even in the midst of action and excitement, there exist rare occasions when neither team scores during a specific time frame. In this article, we will dissect a particular game, analyze the contributing factors, and answer the question: In which quarter did neither team score? The Game: For a better understanding, let's take a look at a fictional basketball game between the Hometown Heroes and the Rival Raiders. 1st Quarter: The game started with both teams locked in an intense battle for supremacy. In the first quarter, the Hometown Heroes managed to score 20 points, while the Rival Raiders were close behind with 18 points. As we can see, both teams were effective in their scoring during this part of the game. 2nd Quarter: During the second quarter, the Rival Raiders seemed to regain their mojo, putting up a solid defense and restricting the Hometown Heroes from establishing a comfortable lead. The Rival Raiders scored 25 points, while the Hometown Heroes managed to score only 15 points. This brought the total score at halftime to 40-43 in favor of the Rival Raiders. 3rd Quarter: Coming out of the halftime break, both teams were eager to continue their respective gritty performances to gain an edge over each other. In the third quarter, the Hometown Heroes bounced back, scoring 25 points and constraining the Rival Raiders to a lesser 15 points. This enabled the Hometown Heroes to reclaim the lead, bringing the total to 65-58. The Pivotal 4th Quarter: And now, we arrive at the crucial point of the game. The tension reached its climax as both teams entered the final quarter. This is the period when the unanticipated situation unfolded, leaving everyone in attendance speechless. Despite their relentless efforts, both the Hometown Heroes and the Rival Raiders failed to register any points in this quarter. Several factors contributed to this bizarre outcome: 1. Defensive Mastery: Both teams displayed exceptional defensive skills during this quarter, resulting in numerous blocks, steals, and forced turnovers. This significantly impacted the offensive performance of both teams. 2. Fatigue: The high-intensity game took its toll on the players, limiting their ability to generate scoring opportunities and execute plays effectively. 3. Pressure: The pressure of maintaining the lead, or closing the gap, for the entirety of the game finally caught up with the players from both teams. This was evident in their focused but ultimately failed attempts to score. Conclusion: Thus, in response to the question, it was during the critical 4th quarter that neither team managed to score. This unusual turn of events will long be remembered by both the players and spectators, highlighting the unpredictable nature of sports and the importance of perseverance and determination. In the end, the Hometown Heroes emerged victorious with a final score of 65-58 - a testament to the sheer unpredictability and excitement that the game of basketball offers."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The \\"highly confident letter\\" was created by twenty investment bankers.

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.

We have the equation: 54 * s - 52 = 110 First, let's start by imagining that we have 54 little boxes, lined up in a neat row. Now, imagine that each of these boxes is magical and has the same number of candies inside. We want to find out how many candies are inside each box, and the letter \\"s\\" will help us find that number. Now we are going to add 52 more candies to all our candies from the boxes. But, oh no! These candies have all vanished! We know that the total number of candies we were supposed to have is 110. So, we are going to try to figure out how many candies are in each box (the value of \\"s\\") so that if we add the vanished 52 candies, we'll have 110 candies. Let's rewrite the equation like this: 54 * s = 110 + 52 Now, let's add the 110 candies and the 52 vanished candies: 54 * s = 162 Now, to find out how many candies are in each magical box, we need to divide the total candies (162) by the number of boxes (54). s = 162 / 54 When we do the math, we find out that: s = 3 So, there are 3 candies in each magical box!"},{"question":"Is the premise \\"A long-bearded man wearing a coat, fur vest, and broad brimmed fur-trimmed hat.\\" true if \\"The man is sleeping.\\"?","response":"To determine if the premise is true even if the man is sleeping, let's analyze the information given step-by-step.

I rarely take the time to write reviews, however, after my terrible experience at \\"xyz restaurant,\\" I wanted to share my thoughts and warn fellow customers to avoid this place. First and foremost, the ambiance of the restaurant was severely lacking. The poor lighting, unappealing décor, and outdated furniture created a gloomy atmosphere. The walls looked like they hadn't been painted in years, while the floors were sticky and unwelcoming. The music playing over the speakers was too loud for my tastes, making it nearly impossible to engage in a conversation. Now, moving on to what should have been the primary focus – the food. I entered the restaurant with high expectations, but they were shattered by the mediocre and unappetizing meals. The menu choices were quite limited, and the descriptions sounded much more appealing than what was actually served. It took forever for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was cold and poorly presented. My salmon was overcooked and bland, while my partner's steak was almost inedible – it was tough, chewy, and drenched in grease. The side dishes were far from impressive, as the mashed potatoes had an odd texture, and the veggies seemed like they had been boiled within an inch of their lives. We had heard great things about their famous cheesecake, but when we tried it, it was dry and tasted like processed cream. Needless to say, it was a disappointing meal. Additionally, the service throughout our visit was subpar, to say the least. The hostess seemed annoyed when we arrived, and the waiter was unfriendly and inattentive. It seemed like we were an inconvenience to them rather than valued customers. Every time we needed anything, we had to wave someone down, as our waiter scarcely paid any attention to us. Moreover, the overall cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired. The restrooms were shockingly filthy, with soap dispensers that were empty and a floor that was in desperate need of a mop. Hygiene standards clearly weren't being upheld, and this reflects poorly on the management of the establishment. To top it all off, I was unpleasantly surprised when the bill arrived. The exorbitant prices were hard to swallow, especially considering the poor quality of the food and service. I cannot comprehend how this restaurant could charge so much for such an awful experience – it's beyond me! In conclusion, I would strongly advise fellow patrons to avoid xyz restaurant like the plague. I cannot stress how truly disappointing and frustrating my experience was – from the dismal ambiance to the subpar food and abysmal service. Save yourself the money and heartache by dining somewhere else; there are plenty of other establishments that offer a much more pleasant experience."},{"question":"Q:2TE25K - The 2TE25K main line two-unit diesel freight locomotive rated at 5000 kW (6705 hp) with AC/DC transmission it is designed to haul freight trains on the Russian Federation lines RZD with the broad gauge.2TE25K diesel locomotive has been used as the basis of the 2TE25A class main line two-unit diesel freight locomotive of the same power rating and featuring AC/AC transmission and collector traction motors.

Answer: The Turing Test is a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) because it provides a measure for determining if a machine has human-like intelligence or not. The test was proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in his 1950 paper, \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence.\\" In the paper, Turing discussed the possibility of creating machines that could think and communicate like human beings. The Turing Test is essentially an imitation game designed to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human being. The test consists of an evaluator who engages in a natural language conversation with two entities: a human and an AI. Both the entities are hidden from the evaluator's view, and the evaluator's task is to determine which participant is human and which is the machine based on their respective responses. If the evaluator is unable to reliably distinguish between the AI and the human, it is said that the AI has passed the Turing Test. This test laid the foundation for a philosophical debate surrounding the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence. It has become a reference point for evaluating machine intelligence and has inspired numerous AI advancements, implementations, and ethical considerations. Although it is not without its criticisms, the Turing Test continues to be a significant topic within the AI community due to its practical applications and implications for understanding the possibility of creating truly intelligent machines."},{"question":"Definition: Classify the relation of question with context to one of these categories: 1) award received, 2) based on, collection, 3) conflict, 4) constellation, 5) convicted of, 6) date of death, 7) director, 8) drafted by, 9) educated at, 10) medical condition, 11) military branch, 12) narrative location, 13) occupation, 14) original network, 15) parent company, 16) point in time, 17) production company, 18) residence, 19) series, 20) service entry, 21) sex or gender, 22) spouse, 23) standards body question.

Paul Verhoeven was born on 18 July 1938, the son of a school teacher, Wim Verhoeven, and a hat maker, Nel van Schaardenburg. Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of Slikkerveer. In 1943 the family moved to The Hague, the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during World War II. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with V1 and V2-rocket launchers, which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, Verhoeven made Black Book (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the Netherlands Film Festival with the words \\"The return of a hero.\\" Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film Beast of Bataan had been announced, but once the shooting for Black Book resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as The Paperboy. Finally, in a rather unexpected twist, Verhoeven followed Black Book by directing a movie in French: Elle, an adaptation of a novel by Philippe Djian. The film by Verhoeven, a psycho-thriller where Isabelle Huppert plays a rape victim, was selected in the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews. Verhoeven has been a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 2007. In December 2016 it was announced that Verhoeven would be the President of the Jury for the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to take place in February 2017. In April 2017 his next French film titled Blessed Virgin was announced, to start filming in August of the same year. It is a biographical film about the life of Benedetta Carlini, which will be portrayed by Elle co-star Virginie Efira, and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C.

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS.

History. Japanese eroge, also known as H-Light novels or hentai games, have their origins in the early 1980s, when Japanese companies introduced their own brands of microcomputer to compete with those of the United States. Competing systems included the Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7, MSX, and NEC PC-8801. NEC was behind its competitors in terms of hardware (with only 16 colors and no sound support) and needed a way to regain control of the market. Thus came the erotic game. The first commercial erotic computer game, \\"Night Life\\", was released by Koei in 1982. It was an early graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, Koei released another erotic title, \\"Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku\\" (\\"Seduction of the Condominium Wife\\"), which was an early role-playing adventure game with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Koei Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game publisher, developer, and distributor founded in 1978.

Yachts, being luxury watercraft often used for recreational purposes or oceanic voyages, rely heavily on advanced communication systems to maintain contact with the outside world, ensure the safety and well-being of passengers and crew, and facilitate smooth functioning on board. Here is a detailed look at some of the offerings made possible by communication satellites to yachts: 1. Connectivity: Satellites provide uninterrupted connectivity to yachts regardless of their location, allowing people on board to stay connected with friends, family, and work associates through emails, messaging services, social media, and voice/video calls even while being in the middle of an ocean. 2. Safety and emergency communication: Communication satellites enable quick and efficient communication with emergency services, such as marine rescue or coast guard, in case of a maritime accident or illness. This instant communication can be crucial in life-threatening situations. 3. Weather updates and navigation: Satellite-based communication systems can supply yachts with updated and accurate weather information, helping sailors to avoid dangerous weather events like hurricanes or typhoons. They also provide access to global positioning data and navigational maps crucial for planning routes and maintaining a safe course throughout the voyage. 4. Entertainment: Satellites allow yachts to receive a variety of streaming services, including live television, on-demand movies, and music, so passengers can enjoy seamless entertainment even when they are out at sea. 5. Data transmission: Yachts often require high-speed data transfer capabilities for various purposes, such as sending and receiving large files, uploading images or videos, or accessing cloud-based applications. Communication satellites provide reliable and fast data transmission rates, enabling efficient data transfers regardless of the yacht's position. 6. Telemedicine: In case of medical emergencies on board, communication satellites can facilitate telemedicine services, allowing a doctor onshore to provide real-time assistance or instructions to the people on the yacht. This remote consultation can prove invaluable when immediate medical attention is needed, and no nearby medical facilities are accessible. 7. Onboard management and monitoring: Satellite communication systems can be integrated with various sensors and monitoring tools on the yacht, which can keep the captain, crew, or yacht owner updated on crucial information, such as fuel levels, engine status, security systems, and more. These data points can be monitored remotely and allow for timely interventions or maintenance when necessary. In summary, the question inquires about the numerous advantages that communication satellites offer to yachts, including connectivity, safety and emergency communications, navigation support, entertainment options, data transmission, telemedicine capabilities, and onboard management and monitoring solutions. The integration of satellite communication systems into yachts enhances the overall experience, safety, and efficiency on these vessels."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

The name Gisela embodies the idea of someone who is committed to their relationships, friendships, and responsibilities. It is a name that suggests loyalty, dedication, and a strong sense of duty. In early Germanic societies, a pledge or hostage was an essential aspect of sealing treaties and agreements between tribes and kingdoms. Giving a hostage, often a child of a ruler or high-ranking noble, helped ensure both parties would abide by the agreed-upon terms. This practice also provided assurance for the recipient that the other party had a vested interest in maintaining the peace. Gisela as a name, therefore, symbolizes trust, devotion, and perseverance. Historically, several women named Gisela held significant roles within European history. Some noteworthy figures include: 1. Gisela of Swabia (990-1043) - She was an influential Holy Roman Empress and the wife of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II. Gisela exerted considerable political influence during her husband's reign and is remembered for her intelligence and strong personality. 2. Gisela of Hungary (985-1065) - The daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Henry II and Cunigunde of Luxembourg, she became the wife of St. Stephen I, the first king of Hungary. As Queen Consort of Hungary, Gisela played a crucial role in the early Christianization of the region. 3. Gisela of Bavaria (984-1060) - The daughter of Duke Henry II of Bavaria and sister of Emperor Henry II, Gisela married King Stephen I of Hungary. Their strong alliance and rule played an essential role in the Christianization of Hungary and the formation of a stable Central European power. The name Gisela has also been popular in literature and the arts. One famous example is the ballet \\"Giselle,\\" with music by Adolphe Adam and choreography by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot. The ballet premiered in France in the 19th century and tells the story of a delicate young girl named Giselle who falls in love with a nobleman disguised as a peasant. In contemporary times, the name Gisela, or its alternative spellings, has been popular among celebrities and public figures. One well-known example is Gisele Bündchen, a Brazilian supermodel who has enjoyed a highly successful career in the fashion industry. In summary, the name Gisela carries a rich history and deep cultural significance that symbolizes loyalty, dedication, and responsibility. Its historical roots and various adaptations keep the name popular and relevant in today's world."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress.

The only reference to a forest in the provided plot is 'the Forest of the Night,' into which Barnaby was driven and subsequently banished following his failure to take over Toyland. But this was not a result of the children sneaking away. Instead, they were confronting Barnaby's aggression directly. If there is a different or more specific context in which the characters sneak away into a forest, it's not observable from the synopsis provided."},{"question":"I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Now, I have a new situation: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. Answer this question please: Who is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, we will consider the given background information and the new situation to determine which individual is exposed to more dangerous sounds. Step 1: Understand the relationship between decibel levels and sound intensity. As mentioned in the background, for every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. High-decibel sounds have more intensity and are potentially damaging to the ears and can cause hearing loss. Step 2: Consider the working environments of Jeremy and Alexander. Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. These machines are known to produce high-decibel sounds. Alexander works in a library, where he is frequently exposed to low-decibel sounds. Step 3: Compare the sound exposure of Jeremy and Alexander. Jeremy is exposed to high-decibel sounds in his work environment. Meanwhile, Alexander is exposed to low-decibel sounds in his work environment. High-decibel sounds are dangerous, as mentioned in the background information. Step 4: Determine who has a higher risk of exposure to dangerous sounds. Since Jeremy is exposed to high-decibel sounds due to operating heavy machinery in his work environment, he is more likely to be exposed to dangerous sounds that could damage his ears and cause hearing loss. Answer: Jeremy is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous."},{"question":"Data: name = Browns Cambridge, food = Japanese, customer rating = 5 out of 5.

Considering the hypothesis that androgen-independent but growth factor dependent epithelial cell division may be important in the development and progression of prostate cancer and that protein tyrosine kinases and phosphotyrosine protein phosphatases are key enzymes modulating the levels of specific phosphotyrosylated proteins implicated in several growth factor regulated signal transduction pathways, our aim was to study the cellular distribution of phosphotyrosine proteins in normal and hyperplastic dog prostates as well as in those of castrated dogs supplemented with either androgens or estrogens in order to modify the relative proportion of basal versus secretory epithelial cells.', 'Following the determination of optimal conditions to specifically detect phosphotyrosine proteins by a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against phosphotyrosine, immunohistochemistry was performed on prostate tissue sections from these experimental animals. In addition to morphological criteria, an antibody to high molecular weight cytokeratins and antisera against arginine esterase were used to selectively identify basal and secretory cells. Since prostatic acid phosphatase may be involved in the local regulation of phosphotyrosine proteins, its distribution was also evaluated with a human prostatic acid phosphatase antiserum.', 'In all prostatic tissues examined, basal epithelial cells were preferentially and specifically stained with antiphosphotyrosine. The staining intensity per basal cell was highest in the estrogen-supplemented dogs. In addition, basal cells were numerically increased and all were highly immunoreactive for high molecular weight cytokeratins. In prostates displaying a well-differentiated glandular epithelium, the number of positive basal cells and their staining intensity varied in the following order: normal < hyperplastic < androgen-supplemented dogs. At all times, the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins in prostatic acid phosphatase and arginine esterase positive cells (secretory) remained low. Fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells were unreactive to antiphosphotyrosine, even though estrogen supplementation increased the prostatic stromal volume.","response":"Question: What was the aim of the study on the cellular distribution of phosphotyrosine proteins in dog prostates?

Options: - need care - come home - fast food - watch television - wash dishes Reasoning process:","response":"To determine what children require to grow up healthy, let's consider each option and its potential impact on a child's overall health and well-being: 1. Need care: Care involves providing physical, emotional, and psychological support for a child. This includes making sure they have proper nutrition, shelter, and emotional support, as well as access to healthcare and educational opportunities. Proper care is essential for a child's overall well-being and development, therefore, this option has a direct impact on a child's health. 2. Come home: Although coming home is important for children to have a stable and safe environment, it doesn't specifically contribute to their health. It may be related to care, but it's not necessarily an independent factor in a child's health. 3. Fast food: Fast food is often high in fat, sugar, and calories, while lacking essential nutrients. A diet high in fast food is not considered healthy and can lead to health problems such as obesity and heart disease. Therefore, this option does not positively contribute to a child's health. 4. Watch television: Watching television can be a form of relaxation and entertainment for children. However, excessive television viewing can lead to sedentary behavior and potentially impact a child's physical and social development. It's not a direct requirement for a child to grow up healthy. 5. Wash dishes: Washing dishes is a chore that can teach children responsibility and discipline. While it's important for children to learn these skills, it's not directly related to their health. Based on the reasoning process above, the most appropriate answer to the question \\"What do children require to grow up healthy?\\" is \\"need care.\\" This is because providing care covers various aspects of a child's life that contributes to their overall health, such as proper nutrition, emotional support, access to healthcare, and educational opportunities."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. The answer to this question is:","response":"Mr. Lomax's reanimated corpse needs to hear music in order to move. Due to the voodoo ceremony performed by Henry and Charles with a pigeon instead of a sacrificial chicken, Bernie's ability to walk towards the hidden money is limited. He can only move when music is playing."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". The content of the acts, particularly section 1 (1) of the amending act of 1938, shows the importance which was then attached to giving architects the responsibility of superintending or supervising the building works of local authorities (for housing and other projects), rather than persons professionally qualified only as municipal or other engineers. By the 1970s another issue had emerged affecting education for qualification and registration for practice as an architect, due to the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with European Union Directives concerning mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the policy for a single market of the European Union. This led to proposals for reconstituting ARCUK. Eventually, in the 1990s, before proceeding, the government issued a consultation paper \\"Reform of Architects Registration\\" (1994). The change of name to \\"Architects Registration Board\\" was one of the proposals which was later enacted in the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and reenacted as the Architects Act 1997; another was the abolition of the ARCUK Board of Architectural Education. What was opened as a result of legislation changing the name of ARCUK?","response":"The question is unanswerable based on the provided text.

This focus will be determined in large part by what you wish to accomplish. If your goal is to make a lot of money, then you'll focus on popular music. If your goal is to be the go-to label for 21st century post avant jazzcore, your focus and approach will be much different. This is needed on many levels. First and foremost, you will build the framework of your label: how you plan on finding and developing talent, your marketing and promotion avenues, how you understand the market and the competition, how you plan on financing your venture, and how you intend on making this a profitable business. If you're independently wealthy, then you may not need investors, at least for the monetary backing. However, you may wish to attract investors who can help you build credibility in your market. For example, if you started a pop music label with your own cash, but were able to convince Sir Paul McCartney to invest in your label, that would be a huge win for your label. To do that, though, you will need a credible plan that shows Sir Paul, or any other investor, that you know what you are doing. Should you need financial backing, having a plan that shows that you understand both the rewards and the risks, and that you have been able to determine a way forward, will go a long way in convincing an investor to risk his capital on your venture. That will include everything from staples to electricity to recording and production costs. Be very thorough when you do this: people who might consider becoming involved in your label will certainly be, when they read your plan! Here are some things to take into account: Administrative costs: rent, utilities, taxes, and licenses are right up front and can be significant. Don't forget to include phone, internet, printers, paper, computers, business cards, and office supplies in this list. You will also need a website, as well as somebody to both create and maintain it. Some of these costs will be weekly, some monthly, and some that only happen every year or two. It may seem like a lot at first, but if you create a five-year plan, you should be able to chart out how these costs will eventually become a small percentage of the overall financial picture. Recording costs: as a record label, you're going to be producing acts. That means you need to account for the recording chain, including studio time, the fees for the engineer and producer (which may be you, but you need to get paid too), mixing engineers, and studio musicians. Marketing budget: a great recording is nothing until it's actually in the market. To do that, you're going to need to promote your label through online ads, magazine ads, press releases, and your website. You will also need to work with artists and designers to create your logo, packaging standards, and overall design plan. Professional services: while you're busy making beautiful music, somebody needs to take care of writing clear, effective legal contracts both for your talent, and for your business deals. For that, you will want the services of a qualified attorney who specializes in the music business. You'll also want an accountant to make sure that you friendly tax collector doesn't come to call. You need people that you can trust and rely on. Planning a cash flow forecast for one, three, and five years out requires some skill, some savvy, and some educated guesswork. The first year should be a very solid plan: you will have a good idea of your startup costs already, and you will likely have in mind (and made contact with) a few bands who will be the first on your roster. Using this information, determine how much you'll be spending, and a projection about how much these acts will bring in. For example, you can base this on how the bands are doing currently: Do they pack clubs? Their music has a good track record, and will probably perform well. If you also have bands that are brand new, and don't have a fan base to work from, you'll have to do significantly more promotion to get the word out. As you add more bands to your roster, your income potential will continue to grow. As you plan for years three to five in your forecast, you will need to determine how and when you will add more talent, and how you will promote them. This is where prediction gets a little more complicated: a great band on your roster may make it much easier for you to promote all the bands on your roster. Similarly, a poorly-performing band will be a cash drain that can lead to financial struggles. Unless you're supremely talented in sales, marketing, music, business, art, conversation, and moonlight as a lawyer, you're going to want to develop a team. Here are some key skill sets that will enable your success: Marketing and sales: somebody who can get out there and promote your label, who knows the industry, and has a personal relationship with artists, promoters, and people who like to support the arts financially. This person or persons will be key to your success: they're responsible for bringing talent in, and getting the word out. The better they perform, the more successful you'll be. Production. You'll need somebody who understands the recording process inside and out, who can find or develop good engineers, mixers, and producers, and who can run a recording session. Contract help. To keep costs down, at least at first, consider hiring other staff on a per-job basis. This would include logo and graphic design, legal, accounting, engineering, and other needs that only occur from time to time. Summary:","response":"1. Determine your focus and goal for the label, which will guide your approach. 2. Build the framework of your label including talent acquisition, marketing, competition analysis, financing, and profitability. 3. Attract investors or use personal wealth to fund your startup, if needed. 4. Calculate all expected administrative costs such as rent, utilities, taxes, licenses, office supplies, and website creation and maintenance. 5. Account for recording costs like studio time, engineer and producer fees, mixing engineers, and studio musicians. 6. Allocate a marketing budget for ads, press releases, and branding. 7. Hire professional services like attorneys and accountants. 8. Plan a cash flow forecast for years one, three, and five, incorporating startup costs, projected income, and promotion costs. 9. Develop a team with key skill sets like marketing and sales, production, and contract help to ensure success in all aspects of your label."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a hateful post in Bengali that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or a group based on the protected characteristics such as race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Sulla's second civil war was one of a series of civil wars of ancient Rome. It was fought between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Gaius Marius the younger in 82 BC. Prelude. Sulla had achieved temporary control of Rome and Marius's exile to Africa through his first march on Rome, but departed soon afterwards to lead the First Mithridatic War. This departure allowed Gaius Marius and his son Gaius Marius the younger to return to Rome with an army and, with Lucius Cornelius Cinna, to wrest control of Rome back from Sulla's supporter Gnaeus Octavius during Sulla's absence. Based on the orders of Marius, some of his soldiers went through Rome killing the leading supporters of Sulla, including Octavius. Their heads were exhibited in the Forum. After five days, Cinna ordered his more disciplined troops to kill Marius's rampaging soldiers. All told some 100 Roman nobles had been murdered. Marius declared Sulla's reforms and laws invalid, officially exiled Sulla and had himself elected to Sulla's eastern command and himself and Cinna elected consuls for the year 86 BC. Marius died a fortnight after and Cinna was left in sole control of Rome. - Consul (abbrev. \\"cos.\\"; Latin plural \\"consules\\") was the title of one of the chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and subsequently a somewhat significant title under the Roman Empire. The title was also used in other city states and also revived in modern states, notably in the First French Republic. The relating adjective is consular, from the \\"consularis\\". - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI, from Old Persian \\"Miradta\\", \\"gift of Mithra\\"; 13563 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 12063 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republics most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus. He is often considered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus. - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (29 September 106 BC 28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname \\"Magnus\\", \\"the Great\\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. - The Third Mithridatic War (7363 BC) was the last and longest of three Mithridatic Wars and was fought between Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was joined by his allies, and the Roman Republic. The war ended in defeat for Mithridates, ending the Pontic Kingdom, and resulted in the Kingdom of Armenia becoming an allied client state of Rome. - Lucius Cornelius Sisenna ( c. 120 -- 67 BC ) was a Roman soldier , historian , and annalist . He was killed in action during Pompey 's campaign against pirates after the Third Mithridatic War . Sisenna had been commander of the forces on the coast of Greece . He was the author of a history in twenty - three books , all of which have been lost , save a few fragments . Sallust is said to have begun historical work as a continuation of Sisenna 's . Sisenna also translated a collection of erotic and picaresque tales by Aristides of Miletus entitled Milesiae fabulae , which was said to have served as a model for Petronius ' Satyricon . - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.

Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins. Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex. Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor. Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism. Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books. Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \\"Stern\\", Wanna Go Out?, was released by Dot in 1973. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","response":"There are definitely other interesting aspects about this article. One noteworthy aspect is Richard Hell's diverse talents and interests, which extend beyond music into poetry, writing, and publishing. A quote from the article highlighting this range of activities is: \\"Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals.\\" Additionally, the collaboration between Hell and Verlaine in creating a fictional poet, Theresa Stern, displays their creativity and willingness to challenge norms. The quote, \\"In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity,\\" illustrates this unique aspect about Richard Hell's life and work. Furthermore, the article provides insights into Hell's early life, family background, and friendships that would later shape his career. This broader context helps to understand his development as an artist and his influence on the punk scene. Overall, the article not only highlights Richard Hell's musical achievements and influence on punk fashion but also delves into his multifaceted talents and personal history, adding depth to our understanding of this iconic figure in American punk culture."},{"question":"Generate short a sentence that is linguistically unacceptable","response":"As an AI language model, my purpose is to generate grammatically accurate and coherent text according to the user's prompt.

Mr Haines' daughter, Bethany, 17, also called for IS to be eradicated. Her aid worker father David was captured by ISIS in Syria and killed. The teenager hopes to follow her father into helping others despite his fate. She spoke as MP vote to join U.S.-led bombing campaign today. Article:","response":"Title: Dragana and Bethany Haines Support Military Force Against ISIS Introduction: The family of late aid worker David Haines, who was brutally murdered by the terrorist group ISIS, has publicly expressed their support for military force against the extremist organization. Dragana Haines, the widow of David, and their 17-year-old daughter, Bethany, have called for the complete eradication of ISIS. As MPs vote today on whether the UK should join the U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS, this grieving family bravely shares their story and the hope for a future where others will be saved from the fate of David Haines. David Haines' Tragic Capture and Murder: In March 2013, experienced aid worker David Haines was captured by ISIS militants in Syria. The father of two had dedicated his life to helping others, working tirelessly to improve the lives of vulnerable and suffering people in countries like Libya, Sudan, and former Yugoslavia. Tragically, in September 2014, Haines was brutally beheaded by jihadists, who proudly shared their horrific acts on the internet. His death shocked the world and marked the start of a chilling trend wherein the terrorist group executed a series of Western hostages in an attempt to instill fear and attract media attention. Family's Inspirational Response and Call for Action: Despite receiving personal threats from the terror group, Dragana Haines has maintained her courage and determination to ensure that her husband's killers are brought to justice. Both she and her daughter, Bethany, fully back the use of military force against ISIS. They have urged various governments not only to participate in the U.S.-led bombing campaign but also to collaborate in every way possible to destroy and eliminate the extremist organization. Bethany Haines has openly shared her desire to follow in her father's footsteps as a humanitarian worker, even though he endured such a cruel end. Rather than being deterred by his brutal death, the teenager remains steadfast in her mission to help those in need and work tirelessly for the betterment of societies facing severe hardship and crises such as those in Syria. UK Parliament's Vote and the Potential Impact: Today, as UK MPs vote on whether to join the U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS, the plight of David Haines and his family serves as a strong argument in favor of taking swift and decisive action to stamp out the terrorist group. By joining the bombing efforts of the United States and other supportive nations, the UK could help weaken ISIS, save lives, and prevent future tragedies like the one suffered by the Haines family. In Conclusion: As the world grapples with the ongoing threat of ISIS, a courageous family like Dragana and Bethany Haines, facing the repercussions of terrorism, stand in inspirational defiance to the violent and oppressive organization. It is their courage and unwavering resolve against these terrorists that epitomise the resilience of the human spirit. As we witness the strength and determination of a mother and daughter who, despite their unimaginable losses, call for the eradication of ISIS, it is essential that the international community works in unison to defeat the terrorist group. Today's vote in the UK Parliament also serves as an opportunity to take a further step towards achieving this goal where we can ensure that people like David Haines, who worked tirelessly for making the world a better place, have not given their lives in vain."},{"question":"Question: Information: - The Lombard League (Italian and Lombard: ) was a medieval alliance formed in 1167, supported by the Pope, to counter the attempts by the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperors to assert influence over the Kingdom of Italy as a part of the of the Holy Roman Empire.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Given these facts, black objects absorb all visible what among the following options: - sunlight - microwaves - Energy. - black holes - dark matter - rays or beams - activation energy - heat energy Answer:","response":"Black objects primarily absorb all visible sunlight in the form of rays or beams. Sunlight consists of a wide range of electromagnetic waves, including visible light, which is responsible for the colors we perceive. When an object appears black, it means that it's absorbing the visible light instead of reflecting it. Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes other types of waves like microwaves, radio waves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. In the context of black objects, we are specifically talking about the visible light spectrum, which includes wavelengths ranging from approximately 400 nanometers (violet) to 700 nanometers (red). When a black object absorbs visible light, it converts the absorbed energy into heat energy. This process of absorption and conversion to heat energy is responsible for the idea that black objects tend to feel warmer when exposed to sunlight compared to lighter-colored objects, which reflect most of the visible light and therefore don't heat up as quickly. It's important to note that black objects do not absorb microwaves, black holes, dark matter, activation energy, or heat energy in the same way they absorb visible light. While some of these phenomena might interact with the object in various ways under specific circumstances, their interactions differ from the absorption of visible light. Black holes are astronomical objects with immense gravitational pull, from which not even light can escape. Though not directly related to the concept of black objects absorbing visible light, they are so named because they do not emit or reflect any form of light or electromagnetic radiation, appearing black in space. Dark matter, on the other hand, is a hypothetical form of matter theorized to account for the majority of the mass in the universe. However, it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, and its presence is only inferred indirectly from its gravitational effects on visible matter. In conclusion, black objects primarily absorb all visible sunlight in the form of rays or beams, converting it into heat energy. This absorption process is specific to the visible light spectrum and does not extend to other phenomena mentioned in the list."},{"question":"Translate to German: The French sector is closed from 11:00 pm to 04:30 am. German:","response":"Der französische Sektor ist von 23:00 Uhr bis 04:30 Uhr geschlossen."},{"question":"Given the question: Where is a good place for a person to put green beans? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - can - plate - mouth - spoon - farmer's market The answer is:","response":"The most suitable option for a person to put green beans depends on the context and the purpose for which the green beans are being used. Analyzing each option provided will help in determining the most appropriate choice for the given question: 1. Can: Canning green beans is a great way to preserve them for future use. If someone has an abundance of green beans and wants to store them for an extended period, using cans is an excellent method to do so. Canned green beans can also be stored easily, transported, and consumed at a later time, which makes this option suitable if the intent is long-term storage and preservation. 2. Plate: Placing green beans on a plate usually implies that they are being served as part of a meal. In this context, the most suitable option for putting green beans would be on a plate, especially if they are cooked, seasoned, and meant to be consumed immediately. This option is appropriate if the intent is to serve and eat the green beans with other food items as part of a meal. 3. Mouth: This option refers to the act of consuming green beans. If the person is hungry and wants to eat green beans directly, their mouth would be the most appropriate place to put them. However, this would not typically be the primary step in storing, preparing, or serving green beans, so this option might not be the most suitable in many scenarios unless the context is solely focused on the consumption of the green beans. 4. Spoon: A spoon could be used to serve green beans or assist in eating them, especially if they are cooked and part of a dish with other ingredients and sauce. This option might be more relevant in a dining context when an individual is ready to eat the green beans as part of a prepared meal. However, a spoon is not necessarily the most appropriate place to put green beans in general cases. 5. Farmer's market: A farmer's market is a locale where farmers sell their freshly harvested produce, which often includes green beans. If a person wants to purchase fresh, locally-sourced green beans, a farmer's market would be a suitable place to find them. In this context, putting the green beans in the farmer's market means offering them for sale to potential buyers, which is a relevant option if the intent is to make them available to the public. Based on the analysis of each option, a conclusion can be drawn that the most suitable place for a person to put green beans depends on the context and intention. If the goal is to store and preserve them for the future, a can would be appropriate. However, if the purpose is to serve and consume them immediately, placing them on a plate or using a spoon would be the most fitting choice. If the goal is to sell the green beans, then a farmer's market would be the best option. In most scenarios, placing green beans on a plate, ready to be served and consumed, would be considered the most suitable option for a general audience, as it aligns with the typical use of green beans in everyday life."},{"question":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]","response":"The paragraph does not provide enough information to determine which fruit retained their quality longer, peaches or cherries, as peaches were candied by Mary and cherries were eaten fresh by Ann."},{"question":"Process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere - The Earth's temperature rises - Question: suppose more greenhouse gases happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect.

Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - The peso (meaning \\"weight\\" in Spanish, or more loosely \\"pound\\") was a coin that originated in Spain and became of immense importance internationally. \\"Peso\\" is now the name of the monetary unit of several former Spanish colonies. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - Mestizo (Peninsular Spanish: , Latin American Spanish, Philippine Spanish: ) is a term traditionally used in Spain and Spanish America to mean a person of combined European and Amerindian descent, or someone who would have been deemed a Castizo (one European parent and one Mestizo parent) regardless if the person was born in Latin America or elsewhere. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the casta system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of their New World colonies. Mestizos are usually considered to be mixed Spaniards by the crown of Spain. - Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money. - A medium of exchange is an intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system. - A coin is a small, flat, round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender. They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade. They are most often issued by a government. - Dollar (often represented by the dollar sign ) is the name of more than twenty currencies, including (ordered by population) those of the United States, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Liberia, Jamaica and Namibia. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of East Timor, Ecuador, El Salvador, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau, the Caribbean Netherlands, and for banknotes, Panama. Generally, one dollar is divided into one hundred cents. - The foreign exchange market (forex, FX, or currency market) is a global decentralized market for the trading of currencies. This includes all aspects of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. In terms of volume of trading, it is by far the largest market in the world, followed by the Credit market. The main participants in this market are the larger international banks. Financial centres around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another. - A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money, or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, who were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks. - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.

What is the relationship between 'salvadoran peso' and 'legal tender'? A:","response":"The Salvadoran peso was the currency of El Salvador between 1877 and 1919. Legal tender refers to a form of money that is recognized and accepted for the payment of goods, services, and debts within a particular country or jurisdiction. In this context, the Salvadoran peso was considered legal tender in El Salvador during the time it was in circulation, meaning it was accepted as a valid form of payment within the country."},{"question":"Math Problem Solve 164*i + 570 = 9331 - 561 for i.","response":"Okay, let's solve this math problem step by step. Imagine we have some candies and we want to find out how many candies are in one bag (that's our \\"i\\"). 1. First, we have the number of candies in all the bags (164*i) and we got an additional 570 candies. 2. Then, there is a total of 9331 candies minus 561 candies. So, we have this equation: 164*i + 570 = 9331 - 561 Let's solve this equation step-by-step: Step 1: Subtract 561 from 9331. 9331 - 561 = 8770 Now our equation looks like this: 164*i + 570 = 8770 Step 2: Subtract 570 from both sides of the equation. 164*i + 570 - 570 = 8770 - 570 164*i = 8200 Step 3: Now we need to find out how many candies are in one bag (value of 'i'). To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 164. 164*i / 164 = 8200 / 164 i = 50 So 'i' is equal to 50. This means there are 50 candies in one bag."},{"question":"What's an example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform?","response":"A task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform is constructing a functional Rube Goldberg machine. A Rube Goldberg machine is a deliberately complex contraption that uses a chain of events to accomplish a simple task, often in an intentionally over-engineered manner. The design and construction of such a machine necessitate a deep understanding of physical objects, their properties, and the ways in which they can interact to achieve the desired goal. Before beginning the construction process, it's essential to determine the end goal of the Rube Goldberg machine. For example, the final objective might be to pour a cup of coffee or pop a balloon. Next, a detailed plan must be made, outlining the sequence of events that will eventually lead to the completion of the task. Constructing a Rube Goldberg machine involves knowledge of various physical objects and their properties. Given that the machine's purpose is to create a chain reaction, it is crucial to know how objects can be connected and how one event can lead to another. For instance, a designer would need to consider: 1. Weight and balance: Using levers, pulleys, and inclined planes, an understanding of weight and balance is crucial. Objects must be positioned and set up in a way that sends signals to other parts of the machine, depending upon their weight and balance points. 2. Friction and traction: The smoothness and surface properties of different objects are essential, as these factors can be exploited to create slow or fast-moving mechanisms to control the flow of energy through the machine. 3. Elasticity: Some components of the machine could involve the use of springs, rubber bands, or bungee cords. The designer must have a solid understanding of the elasticity and tensile strength of these materials, as well as the force required to stretch or compress them to achieve the desired reaction. 4. Energy transfer: Understanding how energy is transferred between objects is important to ensure that the chain reaction proceeds as expected. Momentum, gravity, and kinetic energy are all essential aspects to consider when designing ramps, pendulums, or collision-based interactions. 5. Simple machines: The efficient design of a Rube Goldberg machine often involves the use of simple machines, such as levers, pulleys, inclined planes, screws, wedges, and wheel and axles. Understanding the principles behind these machines, as well as how they can be combined, is vital to the successful construction of a Rube Goldberg machine. 6. Timing and synchronization: A Rube Goldberg machine typically employs a chain reaction that requires precise coordination between events. The designer must have a thorough understanding of the behavior of each physical object and determine the correct timing and synchronization of each component to create the desired effect. To build a Rube Goldberg machine, one must assemble and arrange various physical objects, such as balls, dominoes, mousetraps, switches, funnels, gears, and other unique components. By carefully analyzing their properties, the builder should be able to design and construct a machine that utilizes a domino effect to perform a simple task in a highly complex and creative manner. This task heavily relies on the understanding and manipulation of physical objects to achieve the end goal."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Ayam penyet, region, Malaysia; Ayam penyet, country, Java; Ayam penyet, ingredient, Fried chicken; Ayam penyet, mainIngredient, \\"Squeezed\\" or \\"smashed\\" fried chicken served with sambal; Ayam penyet, servingTemperature, \\"Hot\\"","response":"Ayam penyet is a yummy food from Malaysia and Java, made of fried chicken that is squeezed or smashed and served hot with a special spicy sauce called sambal."},{"question":"Stream of consciousness rationale: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: The New Zealand dollar (sign: ; code: NZD) (Māori: Tāra o Aotearoa) is the currency and legal tender of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency, Tokelau, and a British territory, the Pitcairn Islands.

The game was held up for more than an hour before a decision was made to call the fixture off. It is not known if the match will be replayed at a later date. A Football League spokesman said: \\"Following the abandonment of today's match at Bloomfield Road, it will be for the Football Association to consider any matters relating to crowd behaviour, with the Football League ruling on whether or not the match should be replayed.\\" Before the match, 2,000 Blackpool fans protested outside the ground against the club's owners, the Oyston family. The Seasiders have already been relegated from the Championship and have endured a miserable season, collecting just 25 points from their 45 games before Saturday's final match of the campaign. Saturday's protest was the second in just under a month at Bloomfield Road, after home fans threw fireworks and eggs during their draw against Reading. Shortly after half-time, Blackpool supporters made their way on to the pitch and headed towards the centre circle. Some fans released flares and began angrily chanting towards the Oyston family in the directors' area, as tensions rose inside the stadium. The scene soon became somewhat farcical, as one fan entered the pitch to join the protest on a mobility scooter, while others broke out in a conga line as supporters continued to voice their frustrations. Despite pleas from the referee to restart the match, the protesting fans stood firm and the match was eventually called off on safety grounds after over an hour of on-field protesting. Before the game was abandoned, the visitors were twice denied an opening goal as Joe Lolley and former Blackpool striker Ishmael Miller had their efforts stopped by Elliot Parish. Parish was called into action again shortly afterwards to deny Oscar Gobern's well-directed header, before Peter Clarke's long-range shot nearly gave the home side the lead against the run of play. Jamie O'Hara forced a save from visiting goalkeeper Alex Smithies before the pitch invasion ended the match. Blackpool manager Lee Clark: \\"It just compounds an absolutely horrendous season.

The French national football team, also known as Les Bleus, won the tournament by defeating Brazil in the final with a solid 3-0 victory. The coach of the French team at that time was Aimé Jacquet. The victory was a significant one, being the first time France had won the World Cup, and they did it on their home soil. The final match took place on July 12, 1998, at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris. The French team was captained by Didier Deschamps, who would later return to guide the national team as their coach during their second World Cup victory in 2018. The 1998 French team included several notable players who contributed to their significant victory. Zinedine Zidane, the attacking midfielder, was the star of the final game, scoring two goals. Emmanuel Petit, the defensive midfielder, sealed the triumph with a third goal. Other key players in the squad included Marcel Desailly, Youri Djorkaeff, and Thierry Henry, who all made notable contributions throughout the tournament. The World Cup victory in 1998 was a moment of national pride for France, and the successful hosting of the tournament further amplified the joy and satisfaction in the country. Prior to France in 1998, the last time a host nation had won the World Cup was Argentina in 1978. The success of the host nation in the World Cup has been a rare occurrence, highlighting how challenging it can be to perform under the pressure of home expectations. However, when a host nation does succeed in lifting the trophy, it makes for a memorable World Cup, not only for the home fans but for football lovers worldwide who appreciate the beauty of the game and the unique thrills a World Cup can offer. Every occurrence serves as a reminder of the power sports have in uniting and inspiring nations."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

He was the only child of wealthy sheep-owners Ngaio and Betty Amon. He learned to drive at the age of six, taught by a farm worker on the family farm. On leaving school, he persuaded his father to buy him an Austin A40 Special, which he entered in some minor local races and hillclimbs along with practice on the family farm. Context: After his retirement from F1, Amon dedicated himself to running the family farm in New Zealand's Manawatu District for many years. After retiring from farming, he lived in Taupo in New Zealand's North Island. In the early 1980s he became more well known in New Zealand from test-driving vehicles on the TV motoring series Motor Show and later consulted for Toyota New Zealand, tuning the 1984 Toyota Corolla and subsequent cars for sale there.

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity. The explosion immediately garners the attention of the US government.Even though the detonation was staged to look like an accident, White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) is not convinced: SS-18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately. She believes that terrorists are behind the incident. Her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her. He is smooth-talking and irreverent US Army Special Forces officer Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe (Clooney), and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged, to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board.

The details of how he slept with someone else behind his wife’s back are made public, and the audience boo him. And then they jeer and laugh as he declares he still loves his wife and never stopped loving her. Frank Lampard is due an appearance on Jezza’s show soon because of what happened at the Etihad at the weekend. 'I cheated on Chelsea – but I still love that club!' A Kyle audience would hound him off the stage: but football fans are so over-emotional they swallow this garbage. One of the great things about Lampard’s goal against Chelsea on Sunday is that this myth that a professional footballer can love a club has been exploded and hopefully no fan will ever be so naïve they embarrass themselves by spouting such nonsense ever again. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard applauds the Chelsea supporters at the Etihad on Sunday. Lampard scores the equaliser past Thibaut Courtois in Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Chelsea. Lampard is due an appearance on The Jeremy Kyle Show after scoring against Chelsea at the weekend. The general rule is that players play for whoever will pay them the most. 'I love this club, I never wanted to leave,' actually translates as: 'I was going to leave but they increased my money so I stayed.' It’s not a problem, unless a player tries to convince us they love a club. In Lampard’s case he didn’t want to leave Chelsea, but he had no choice – the club didn’t want to keep him. But that doesn’t mean he should agree to go to Manchester City on loan where he knows he is likely to play against Chelsea. Who knows how the season will pan out, but that goal Lampard scored at the Etihad might be crucial. If Manchester City pip Chelsea to the title by a point in May then it will be Lampard’s equaliser that will be remembered as a massive moment that helped deny Chelsea the title. So how can Lampard claim to love a club when that club is denied two points by a goal he has scored? That goal potentially, damages Chelsea’s chances of winning the title for the first time since 2010. Every fan of a football club knows exactly what I’m talking about. If you love a club, you don’t do anything to damage their chances of being successful. Lampard is a legend with the Chelsea fans after his 13-year spell at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea fans showed their appreciation with a banner honouring Lampard at the Etihad Stadium. Lampard said: 'I didn’t expect to come on and score.' Really? Chelsea’s all-time top scorer, a man who’s biggest strength throughout his career has been his ability to score goals, is brought on with Man City losing 1-0, and he didn’t expect to score? I appreciate it’s sometimes difficult after a game for a player to find the right thing to say. And ultimately I’m not criticising Lampard for playing the game and scoring a goal – it’s what he does best of course. But this should be a lesson to all professional footballers: only the most gullible fans will swallow your nonsense about your 'love' for their club. You can’t love a club and then score against them – no amount of applauding those fans afterwards will take that goal away. Lampard loved his time at Chelsea, he loved the support of the fans he had at Stamford Bridge. But he can’t love Chelsea and then score such a big goal against them. Lampard (right) scores the equaliser for Manchester City as Chelsea captain John Terry shows his dismay. Lampard acknowledges the crowd but tones down his celebration after scoring against his old club. VIDEO I told Lampard to score - Pellegrini. At the risk of returning to the Jeremy Kyle analogy again, it’s in Lampard’s DNA to score goals; as he said after the game: 'I’m just doing my job.' I respect Lampard for that. But people who love a football club give up work to show that love and watch them. They don’t 'just do their job', damage them, and then still profess love. Lampard can do what he wants – play for who he wants, and score for who he wants. But he’s mugged off Chelsea fans massively here. If it is true love he wouldn’t dream of playing against them, especially not a title rival. He didn’t have to join Man City but he did. And as soon as he did that, as Mourinho said, 'The love stories are over.' And the Chelsea fans with their Frank Lampard banners at the Etihad looked like the man on the Kyle show who walked in on his missus in bed with another bloke. 'I can forgive everything!' he desperately cries, as the rest of the world cringes for him. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"The article discusses the concept of footballers loving a particular club, focusing on the example of Frank Lampard and his time at Chelsea. It argues that Lampard's goal against Chelsea while playing for Manchester City exposed the myth that a professional footballer can genuinely love a club. It suggests that most players play for whoever is willing to pay them the most, and says that Lampard's decision to join Manchester City and score against Chelsea proves that he doesn't truly love the club. The article criticizes fans who believe players' claims of love for a club, saying that \\"only the most gullible fans will swallow\\" such statements. It claims that Lampard could not love Chelsea and score a significant goal against the team that potentially damaged their chances of winning the title. It goes on to say that a real fan would not take any action that could hurt the club, and that Lampard's decision to join a title rival and score against Chelsea proves that his love for the club was merely a facade. In conclusion, the article suggests that Lampard's actions should serve as a lesson to both footballers and fans about the reality of love for a club. It asserts that players should not claim to love a club if they are willing to play against it and potentially hurt its chances of success, while fans should be more critical of players' 'love' for their team."},{"question":"Math Problem Solve -419*l + 2781 = -696*l + 380*l for l.","response":"To solve the equation -419*l + 2781 = -696*l + 380*l for l, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, there are no like terms. On the right side, we have two terms containing 'l': -696*l and 380*l. Combine the two terms: -696*l + 380*l = (-696 + 380) * l = -316*l Now the equation becomes: -419*l + 2781 = -316*l Step 2: Isolate the variable 'l'. To isolate 'l', we want to move the term with 'l' on the right side to the left side. We can do this by adding 316*l to both sides of the equation: -419*l + 316*l + 2781 = -316*l + 316*l This simplifies to: (-419 + 316) * l + 2781 = 0 -103*l + 2781 = 0 Step 3: Solve for 'l'. Now we want to isolate 'l' further by moving the constant term from the left side to the right side. To do this, subtract 2781 from both sides of the equation: -103*l = -2781 To find the value of 'l', divide both sides of the equation by -103: l = -2781 / -103 l ≈ 27 The solution to the equation is l ≈ 27."},{"question":"Cet institut offre une occasion unique qui n’existe nulle part ailleurs dans le monde.

The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen, via the Fab's variable region. Each tip of the \\"Y\\" of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance. The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region (located at the base of the \\"Y\\"), which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions. The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system. Based on this passage, what is the role of antibodies in the immune response? Let's think fast. Stream of consciousness:","response":"The role of antibodies in the immune response is crucial for protecting the body against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies, or immunoglobulins, are large, Y-shaped proteins produced mainly by plasma cells. They contribute to the immune response through the following mechanisms: 1. Recognizing and binding to antigens: Each antibody contains a paratope (a structure similar to a lock) at the tips of the \\"Y\\" that specifically binds to a unique epitope (analogous to a key) on an antigen present on the pathogen's surface. This precise binding allows the antibody to identify and target the pathogen for neutralization. 2. Tagging microbes or infected cells: Once an antibody has bound to an antigen, it can act as a marker to tag the microbe or infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system. This helps to recruit immune cells like macrophages and T-cells to efficiently eliminate the threat. 3. Neutralizing pathogens directly: Some antibodies can directly neutralize their target by blocking essential parts of the pathogen that are needed for invasion and survival. This prevents the pathogen from causing disease and helps to keep the body healthy. 4. Communicating with other immune system components: Antibodies can interact with other parts of the immune system through their Fc region (located at the base of the \\"Y\\"). This region contains a conserved glycosylation site that plays a key role in these interactions, allowing the antibody to activate other immune cells and coordinate an effective defense against the invading pathogen. In summary, antibodies play a critical role in the immune response by recognizing and binding to antigens, tagging pathogens for destruction, neutralizing them directly, and communicating with other components of the immune system to mount a coordinated attack. These functions make antibodies an essential part of the body's defense against disease-causing agents."},{"question":"Answer the following question: M: Not really.

So, when we put it together, it says \\"Há! Otevřu bránu.\\""},{"question":"Premise: a few Texaco stations Hypothesis: Several gas stations. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise states \\"a few Texaco stations.\\" Texaco is a known brand of gas stations, so this is referring to a small number of Texaco gas stations. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states \\"Several gas stations.\\" This indicates a number of gas stations, potentially of any brand, not specifically Texaco. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we should check if the information provided in the premise necessarily leads to the conclusion presented in the hypothesis. In this case, the premise specifies a few Texaco stations, while the hypothesis refers to several gas stations in general. Although both refer to a number of gas stations, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise because it does not specifically mention Texaco stations. The premise is more specific than the hypothesis, so the hypothesis could be true in some cases but is not guaranteed by the premise alone."},{"question":"The Browns headed to Buffalo to try to collect their first win of the season, but the Bills routed the Browns 33-13. With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-14 and became the first team to lose 17 consecutive regular season games since the St. Louis Rams in the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The Browns also became the fourth team to start a season 0-14, joining the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers (went winless in a 14-game season), 1980 New Orleans Saints (went 1-15), and the 2008 Detroit Lions (went 0-16). The Browns also tied their franchise record for total losses in a single season. The Browns also became the first team since the 2013 Houston Texans, who lost their last 14 games after starting their season 2-0, to have 14 straight losses in a single season. On December 21, OT Joe Thomas was voted to his 10th consecutive Pro Bowl. Thomas now holds the Browns record for most Pro Bowls, passing Pro Football Hall of Famers Jim Brown (nine) and Lou Groza (nine). Thomas joins Pro Football Hall of Famers Merlin Olsen (14), Mel Renfro (10), Barry Sanders (10) and Lawrence Taylor (10) as the only players in NFL history to make the Pro Bowl in each of their first 10 seasons. Thomas' streak of 10 consecutive Pro Bowls is the longest active streak in the NFL. Answer this question: How many total points were scored in the game?","response":"In the game, the Buffalo Bills scored 33 points and the Cleveland Browns scored 13 points. To find the total points scored, we add both team's points together. So, 33 points (from the Bills) plus 13 points (from the Browns) equals 46 points.

Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: To determine the exact number of grains of sand on Earth, we'd have to consider all the various factors that contribute to the different types of sand and their locations. This includes deserts, beaches, riverbeds, and even sand particles that are in the air due to wind and erosion. We also need to take into account that the size of a grain of sand varies, and even particles that are too small to see with the naked eye or a simple microscope. Moreover, sand is constantly being created and destroyed through various natural processes, which alter the total amount on a daily basis. Additionally, the world's coastlines and landscapes are continually changing due to factors such as tectonic shifts, erosion, and human activities. These changes can lead to the creation of new sand deposits or the depletion of existing ones. As a result, the exact number of grains of sand on Earth is always in flux, making it impossible to provide a precise count at any given time. Furthermore, even if we attempted to count the grains of sand using advanced technology or methods, the process would likely be too time-consuming and impractical to complete. In light of all these factors, it is simply not possible to tell the exact number of grains of sand on Earth. The dynamic nature of the planet, the variation in sand grain sizes, and the countless locations where sand can be found all contribute to the impossibility of providing a precise number."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

Answer:","response":"\\"Invasion of the Grex: The Spore Chronicles\\" The movie title, \\"Invasion of the Grex: The Spore Chronicles,\\" captures both the unique and mysterious nature of the extraterrestrial lifeform that appears as gel-like spores and hybridizes with earthly plants. Combining the concept of \\"Grex\\" - which is a cross-breeding between two different species - and adding the element of \\"Invasion,\\" the title reflects the gradually growing impact and danger posed by these alien lifeforms on humanity. Furthermore, the subtitle \\"The Spore Chronicles\\" hints at a potential series of events or stories linked to these peculiar spores, adding depth and intrigue to the overall concept of the film. It suggests a continuing struggle between humans and this otherworldly entity, as well as the potential evolution of the story as it unfolds. The title also pays homage to the original 1956 film \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\\" which shares a similar storyline. The plot weaves together various themes, such as mystery, horror, and science fiction, as it follows the journey of the strange lifeform from an unidentified planet to Earth. As the characters Elizabeth Driscoll and Matthew Bennell investigate the alien lifeform and the unusual events unfolding around them, the title hints at the worldwide ramifications of their discovery. The film highlights the intense suspense and paranoia experienced by the protagonists as they attempt to understand and navigate the unnerving invasion of these mysterious, shape-shifting spores. Overall, \\"Invasion of the Grex: The Spore Chronicles\\" provides a thrilling, captivating title to draw audiences into the story, while hinting at intricate plotlines, worldwide catastrophe, and the timeless themes of human perseverance and strength in the face of terrifying alien invaders."},{"question":"Here are two sentences: Other data showed that buyers snapped up new and existing homes at a brisk pace in April , spurred by low mortgage rates .

We were inseparable, just like Smithy and Gavin in the show.' He added that when the show first aired all of his friends kept texting and talking about the resemblance to his character. Smith said he tends to enjoy watching football, a drink and a good laugh and can see why James thought it would make a good character for television. Luckily the real life Smithy thought that his on stage alter ego was hilarious. He recalls that when the pair first met he was already taking on roles in adverts and soap operas. But he praised him for being 'a normal guy' who is very down to earth. Corden who is close friends with David.

Corden, in turn, praised his muse Smithy saying he was a great guy and he hoped that the character that he had created based off him had done him proud. Gavin & Stacey: Mathew Horne and James Corden are pictured here filming the Christmas episode of 'Gavin and Stacey' in Barry Island, Wales - Corden recently bumped into the inspiration for one of his characters. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"James Corden, the popular comedy actor, recently encountered the real-life inspiration behind one of his most famous TV characters, Neil 'Smithy' Smith, at a charity football match in Bedford. The fictional Smithy from the hit BBC series Gavin & Stacey was based on this 41-year-old father of three, who happens to share the same nickname. James Corden's cousin and Neil's close friend of more than 30 years, Lee Andrews, played a significant role in shaping the character, as their friendship resulted in the creation of hilarious and memorable moments on the show. The meeting between Corden and the real Smithy was purely coincidental and took place at a charity football match meant for the opening of a new Salvation Army pitch, which was planned by Corden's late uncle, Roger Collins. In the series, Corden drew from the camaraderie between Neil and Lee, and the antics they got up to in their youth, as the basis for his onscreen relationship with his character, Gavin. When Gavin & Stacey first aired, Neil's friends were quick to notice the resemblance between the character and their friend. The real Smithy enjoys watching football, having a drink, and a good laugh, and he sees why James Corden used these traits as a basis for his TV character. Luckily, Smithy finds his on-screen persona to be entertaining and appreciates the humor in it. Throughout their interaction at the charity football match, both Corden and Smithy expressed mutual respect and admiration for one another. Corden, a BAFTA winner who has also performed with David Beckham, was happy to participate in the match and share his genuine affection for Smithy. The real Smithy, too, was excited to play alongside the award-winning actor who portrayed him on television. Corden praised his muse, hoping that the character he created in homage to Smithy has done the real man proud."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas - Question: suppose bird couple mate with each other happens, how will it affect more heat occurs. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"The given scenario describes the process through which dead organic material, accumulated at the bottom of oceans, riverbeds, or swamps, transforms through several stages into petroleum or natural gas. In this context, the mating of a bird couple seems to be unrelated to the heat levels influencing the decomposition process. Regarding the bird mating incident, it will most likely have no direct effect on the heat levels in the process, as the energy produced by the birds will be negligible compared to the geological forces at play, such as sedimentation and pressure, which cause the transformation of the organic material into kerogen. The second effect mentioned in the process refers to the piling-up of sediment on top of the organic layer. The occurrence of bird mating will not have a direct influence on sedimentation. Even if the birds contributed small amounts of organic material through their excretions or decomposing bodies, the quantity will be insignificant compared to the vast amounts of decomposing matter that accumulate on the ocean floor or riverbeds. Therefore, the mating of a bird couple will have no effect on both heat levels and sediment piling up in the described process. The transformation of organic material into petroleum or natural gas is carried out by geological forces and natural processes over millions of years, and the impact that individual events, such as bird mating, have on these large-scale processes is minimal."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence from the Quran in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

The so called “TRNC census” carried out in April 2006 showed that out of a total population of 256,644 in Northern Cyprus, 132,635, or 52%, were Turkish Cypriots in the sense that they were born in Cyprus of at least one Cyprus-born parent (for 120,007 of these both parents were Cyprus-born). In addition, 43,062 so called “TRNC citizens” (17%) had at least one non-Cypriot Turkish-born parent, 2,334 so called “TRNC citizens” (1%) had parents born in other countries, 70,525 residents (27%) had Turkish citizenship, and 8,088 (3%) were citizens of other countries (mainly UK, Bulgaria, and Iran). Question: How many more residents in Northern Cyprus had Turkish citizenship compared to those who were citizens of another country? Answer:","response":"To find out how many more residents in Northern Cyprus had Turkish citizenship compared to those who were citizens of another country, we need to subtract the number of residents who are citizens of other countries from the number of residents who have Turkish citizenship. According to the given text, the number of residents who have Turkish citizenship is 70,525. The number of residents who are citizens of other countries is 8,088. Therefore, performing the subtraction 70,525 - 8,088 gives us 62,437. So, 62,437 more residents in Northern Cyprus had Turkish citizenship compared to those who were citizens of another country.

There are some scientific ways of drinking water. 1. It is the best medicine to drink two glasses of water in the morning. 2. Drink clean water. 3. Drink the water that has not been boiled. Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhages and so on. 2) Drinking water at about 10 am helps your body keep enough water. 3) Drinking water at about 3 pm can clean out the wastes in your body. 4) About eight o'clock in the evening is the best time to drink water. Your blood gets thicker when you sleep. Water will make your blood less thick. Besides, we should drink 2L of water every day. Water is so important for our life. We should drink water often. Question: From the passage, we can see the best time to drink water is _ . Answer: Answer:","response":"About eight o'clock in the evening."},{"question":"Q:I can use this background: They feed on living hosts. As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed. Now, I have a new situation: Two frogs are being examined in a laboratory. Frog X was found in a pond in the forest and has a parasite in it. Frog Y was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The employees at the lab weren't planning on analyzing any frogs, but when they found the one outside their front door they changed their mind. Answer this question please: Which frog is less likely to contract an illness? A:","response":"To determine which frog is less likely to contract an illness, we need to consider the different factors and conditions affecting both Frog X and Frog Y. Starting with Frog X, it was found in a pond in the forest and has a parasite in it. As mentioned in the background information, parasitic fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host, which in this case is Frog X. This means that the parasite is obtaining nutrients from the frog, which could weaken its immune system and make it more susceptible to contracting other illnesses. Additionally, the presence of a parasite could also cause illness in the frog, as disease-causing fungi are parasitic and could trigger negative health effects in the host organism. On the other hand, Frog Y was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The fact that it is missing an eye might mean that it had encountered a previous infection or injury that led to the loss, or it could have been born with a deformity. In either case, this suggests that Frog Y might have experienced a health challenge in the past. However, currently, we do not have any information about any parasites or pathogens affecting it. Considering the information provided, it is difficult to definitively determine which frog is less likely to contract an illness without more context or information about their overall health and immune systems. However, based solely on the information given, Frog Y appears to be less likely to contract an illness as it is not currently known to be hosting a parasite like Frog X. That being said, it is important to note that other factors like exposure to pathogens, genetic predispositions, and environmental stressors could also influence the likelihood of contracting illnesses for both frogs. Therefore, it would be beneficial to conduct further examinations or tests on both frogs to gather more information before making a conclusive determination."},{"question":"Article: Flow like the river of change Little stream ran down from a high mountain through many villages and forests.

The author of the tweet starts by describing their current situation, sitting in the waiting room, waiting for someone named Boogz. This statement is neutral, simply setting the scene for the reader. However, the author's feeling of tiredness is expressed in the next sentence with \\"i'm super tired!\\" The use of 'super' in this context serves to emphasize the extent of the author's fatigue. The author then follows up on this sentiment of tiredness by mentioning that they don't think they will go into the control room when they arrive at the \\"stu\\", which is presumably a shorthand term for 'studio'. This reinforces the level of exhaustion or lack of energy the author is experiencing, as they are not just physically tired, but also feeling unenthusiastic about their upcoming task or activity. Additionally, the use of the casual language, informal contractions, and shorthand adds a sense of spontaneity to the tweet, reflecting the author's mood, and possibly suggesting impatience as they await Boogz's arrival.

Without further information about the nature of the interaction or the individuals involved, it is not possible to definitively conclude that two men hanging out means they are friends. Here are some alternative scenarios to illustrate why it is not possible to tell: 1. Acquaintances: The two men might be acquaintances who have met through work, social events, or mutual friends. They could be hanging out to get to know each other better or because they have a common interest. In this case, they are not yet friends, but they might become friends at some point. 2. Colleagues: They could be coworkers who are hanging out together after work or during a lunch break to discuss work-related matters or to develop a more cordial working relationship. In this case, their interaction might be primarily professional, and they may not necessarily be friends outside of work. 3. Family Members: The two men could be related, such as being brothers, cousins, or in-laws. In this case, they might be hanging out due to family obligations or shared familial experiences, rather than being friends by choice. 4. Participants in a Social Activity: The two men might be members of the same sports team, hobby club, or volunteer organization. They might be hanging out together while participating in that activity, but not necessarily developing a friendship outside of that context. 5. Neighbors: They could be neighbors who are hanging out due to proximity, while not necessarily forming a close friendship. 6. Business Partners: The two men might be business partners, and their interaction might be focused on discussing or managing their business venture. In this case, they might be hanging out to work on their shared project but not necessarily be friends outside of their business partnership. In conclusion, without more information about the context of the situation and the nature of the relationship between the two men, it is not possible to tell whether they are hanging out as friends or for another reason.

The provided text is \\"SculptureinthegardenStatuemadebyPalleLykkeJulsgart\\". I'm assuming these are English words based on the request. The most logical parsing would seem to be: I can identify several distinct words inside this unbroken string. So step by step solution would be: 1. Start from the first letter of the string. 2. \\"Sculpture\\" seems to be a clear English word at the start, I'll isolate that. 3. Then we have \\"in\\", which is a proper English word to link two ideas, so I’ll also isolate that. 4. Then it seems like \\"the\\" is a word that commonly occurs in English sentences. 5. Next \\"garden\\" would be a standalone word that makes sense following \\"the\\". 6. \\"Statue\\" is the most obvious next word. It makes sense conceptually following the previous context. 7. The word \\"made\\" comes next, which seems logical post a noun. 8. The preposition \\"by\\" makes sense in this context as it can be used to indicate an action done by someone. 9. The remaining string \\"PalleLykkeJulsgart\\" seems like it could be a name, given it's following \\"made by\\", which often precedes a person's name. Looking at the structure of this remaining string, and based on naming conventions, it makes sense to split these into three distinct components: \\"Palle\\", \\"Lykke\\", and \\"Julsgart\\". These seem like plausible first, middle and last names. Therefore, when you combine all the isolated words, you would get: \\"Sculpture in the garden Statue made by Palle Lykke Julsgart\\"."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in Igbo language, translate the sentence to English language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Q: Igbo sentence: 34 Joshua we si na Lekish gabiga, ya na Israel nile, rue Eglon; ha ma ulo-ikwū-ha megide ya, buso ya agha; 35 ha were ya n'ubọchi ahu, were ọnu mma-agha tib͕ue ya, madu nile nke di nime ya ka ọ wezugara ka ebibie ha n'ubọchi ahu, dika ihe nile si di nke o mere Lekish.

Are pancakes typically prepared in a pot?","response":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question. The key elements of the question are \\"pancakes\\" and \\"prepared in a pot.\\" Step 2: Define the key elements. Pancakes are a type of flat, round bread which are made from a batter and cooked on a frying pan or griddle. A pot is a deep, round-bottomed cooking container used for boiling, simmering, or stewing food. Step 3: Compare the characteristics of the key elements. Pancakes require a flat surface for cooking so that they can be evenly cooked and easily flipped. A pot, on the other hand, provides a round-bottomed, deep surface that is suited for containing liquids or foods that need to be submerged in a liquid. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison. Since pancakes require a flat cooking surface and pots do not provide that, it can be concluded that pancakes are not typically prepared in a pot.

Sheen pledged the grand in a tweet to Tommy Up, the owner of Philadelphia's PYT burger joint where McCoy, an Eagles running back, dined Monday afternoon.

Please tell Rob K I'm pledging 1000 dollars to him for the tip debacle just wanna help. c #NoJudgement\\" The owner accused","response":"Step 1: Understand the task My goal is to follow the story and discuss how Charlie Sheen has offered to help a waiter who has received a small tip from a wealthy football player. Step 2: Gather more information about the situation Before discussing the story, I need to understand the context. Charlie Sheen, a celebrity actor, has decided to gift 1,000 to a waiter, Rob Knelly, who works at a restaurant called PYT in Philadelphia. This was after the waiter received a 20 cent tip from LeSean McCoy, a football player who ate at the restaurant. The total bill was 61.76, making the tip only .3% of that amount. Step 3: Mention the controversy The situation garnered attention as the football player's tip was considered too low, leading to public disapproval. Charlie Sheen, learning of this incident, offered his assistance through Twitter by pledging to give Rob the waiter 1,000 in response to this tip debacle. Step 4: Discuss the impact of Charlie Sheen's tweet Charlie Sheen tweeted to the restaurant owner, Tommy Up, about his pledge to give 1,000 to Rob Knelly, showing his support and solidarity. His gesture sends a message that such conduct from a wealthy individual is not ideal. By using the hashtag #NoJudgement, Charlie Sheen could be indicating that he is not judging either party involved but wants to help resolve the issue as best as he can.

Question: suppose If more water filters into the rocks happens, how will it affect it takes longer for rocks to break down. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","response":"B: less If more water filters into the rocks, it will lead to an increase in the freeze-thaw cycle. When water seeps into the rocks and subsequently freezes, it expands, causing stress on the rock and forming cracks. Upon thawing, the water flows further into these cracks before freezing again, expanding more and increasing the pressure on the rock structure. This continuous freeze-thaw cycle will cause the rocks to break down more quickly. Similarly, more water can cause more significant or more frequent expansion-contraction patterns as the rocks heat up and cool down due to temperature fluctuations. This process will also contribute to the formation of cracks and the deterioration of rock materials. In conclusion, if more water filters into the rocks, it will result in the rocks breaking down more quickly due to an accelerated freeze-thaw cycle and increased pressure from temperature-related expansion and contraction."},{"question":"Short movie review: with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"The critic is thinking positively about the movie.

In this article, we dive into the fascinating world of toddlers' eating habits and investigate the reasons behind their peculiar preferences, dietary challenges faced by parents, and strategies to encourage a well-rounded diet. Understanding the Picky Eater When toddlers begin their journey into the world of solid foods, their taste buds can be quite unpredictable. Vegetables smothered in cheese or fruits dipped in yogurt might become a favorite, while meat might be met with disdain. In many cases, parents are not to blame for their children's preferences. Researchers suggest that taste preferences may be formed in infancy, which means that what babies were exposed to during their first months of life could play a role in their likes and dislikes. Genetics, too, can influence a child's taste preferences. Some children may have a higher sensitivity to bitter flavors, which is why they may avoid vegetables like broccoli or sprouts, while some may be more drawn to sweet flavors, leading to a preference for fruits or treats. The Role of Environment and Culture Environmental factors also play a huge part in shaping a child's taste preferences and eating habits. Cultural norms, family customs, and regional cuisines contribute to the types of foods that toddlers are exposed to. For instance, a child who grows up in a Mediterranean household is more likely to develop a taste for olives, tomatoes, and fish compared to a child growing up in a more meat-centric American household. In addition to this, toddlers, in general, enjoy imitating others in their environment, which significantly influences their food choices. When they observe family members, friends, and peers enjoying a particular food, they are more likely to try it themselves. Strategies to Encourage Better Eating Habits Acknowledging that toddlers' eating habits are not solely a consequence of parenting can help pave the way for more creative and effective strategies in cultivating healthier eating behaviors. 1. Repeated exposure: Patience and persistence are key when introducing new foods to a toddler. It may take multiple attempts, sometimes over a month, before a toddler feels comfortable enough to consistently accept a new food. The trick is to repeatedly expose them to a variety of foods in a pressure-free environment. 2. Presentation matters: Toddlers are often more inclined to try foods if they are presented in an appealing manner. This could involve cutting up fruits or vegetables in fun shapes, arranging them colorfully on the plate, or coming up with creative names. 3. Involvement in meal preparation: Young children who help prepare meals may be more interested in trying the foods they've helped to create. Activities like washing fruits and vegetables, stirring, or putting toppings on a dish can all engage a toddler in meal preparation. 4. Encourage family meals: Eating together as a family helps to create healthy eating habits, as well as a sense of routine and comfort in trying new foods. Toddlers learn by observing their family members and may be more likely to partake in eating a meal when they see others enjoying it. 5. Addressing sensory concerns: Some toddlers may not like certain foods because of their texture or appearance. In such cases, it may help to modify the food's texture, like blending it, altering the cooking method, or mixing it with other familiar foods. Conclusion In conclusion, it is essential for parents not to feel discouraged, nor blame themselves or their culinary prowess for their toddlers' eccentric eating habits. Evidence suggests that several factors can contribute to a child's food preferences, including genetics, early infancy exposure, environment, and cultural norms. By incorporating patience, creativity, and a variety of approaches, parents can help introduce their toddlers to a diverse and healthy array of foods. Remember, like the story of Alice, even if broccoli is only enjoyed with a dollop of ketchup, the key is to appreciate the colorful journey through the culinary world with your little ones."},{"question":"Fact 1: Sunlight and rain can cause a rainbow.

Although CBT involves behavioral components, behavioral therapy focuses strictly on behaviors. The main goal of behavioral therapy is to encourage you to get out there and do something you enjoy. Common symptoms of depression are avoidance and withdrawal, which actually make the condition worse. Through behavioral therapy you will be encouraged to take part in activities that would bring you joy and satisfaction. You can either get back into activities you once loved, or try something you have always wanted to experience. It's all about getting out there and creating a pleasurable experience for yourself to combat your depression. Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) has been shown to be effective in treating depression. This therapy focuses on the relationships in your life. Do you find that you have a hard time interacting or connecting with others? If so, this therapy option may work well for you. This structured therapy focuses on cultivating the skills needed to deal with relationship problems. In this therapy you will explore your current relationships and the problems you're experiencing. These problems can have a significant impact on your depression; they may even be a factor in how you're feeling. IPT can also help you recognize patterns in your relationships, particularly those that are adding to your depression. Once you recognize these patterns, you can begin to improve your relationships. Your therapist will also teach you how to effectively cope with grief and support ways in which you can get along with others. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse in depressed individuals. This therapy is meant to help you control your thoughts and emotions. It is generally offered in groups and involves meditation. While meditating, you will be taught to focus on the present, rather than worrying about the past or the future. The goal is to stop your mind from wandering off and worrying, while also trying to inhibit negative thoughts and feelings.","response":"This article discusses various therapies for depression, including behavioral therapy, which encourages pleasurable activities, interpersonal therapy (IPT) that focuses on relationships, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for controlling thoughts and emotions through meditation."},{"question":"Complete the passage.

Other charges say the pair possessed an assault rifle that is illegal in","response":"California and allege that Monroy-Bracamonte is in the United States illegally, having been previously deported to Mexico multiple times. The case has reignited a long-standing debate over immigration policy and border security, as well as the issue of gun control and the accessibility of assault weapons in the United States. According to court documents, the crime spree began on the morning of October 24 when deputies responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a motel parking lot. The suspects opened fire on the deputies, killing one and seriously wounding the other. They then embarked on a high-speed chase, during which Monroy allegedly carjacked a vehicle, causing the driver to be shot and wounded. They abandoned the vehicle and carjacked another, which led to a pursuit into a residential neighborhood. The second deputy was killed in the subsequent shootout. Monroy-Bracamonte, 34, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances that make him eligible for the death penalty, attempted murder, carjacking, evading police, possessing a firearm as a felon, and being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm. His wife, Janelle Marquez Monroy, faces charges of murder, attempted murder, and carjacking. The couple has not yet been granted public defenders, however, they will likely be assigned counsel in the near future. During the arraignment, authorities revealed that Monroy-Bracamonte had previously been deported to Mexico twice, once in 1997 and again in 2001, after being convicted of drug and firearms offenses. It is believed that he reentered the United States illegally sometime after his last deportation. His immigration status has generated significant political controversy, with some commentators arguing that it illustrates the need for more stringent border security measures, while others claim that the incident illustrates broader issues with the US criminal justice system. In response to the incident, California Governor Jerry Brown issued a statement noting the \\"brutal and callous acts\\" committed by the couple and sent his condolences to the families of the fallen deputies. The case has also sparked renewed calls for tighter gun control legislation, particularly with regard to assault weapons, which are often at the center of high-profile mass shootings. As the case continues to unfold, local and national authorities are working in tandem to determine the motivations behind the attacks, to assess potential security gaps that may have allowed the couple to carry out their rampage, and to address the broader implications of the incident for the state of California and the country as a whole. The trial, which is expected to be highly publicized, will undoubtedly serve as a platform for continued discussions surrounding immigration, border security, and firearms control."},{"question":"What is the full name of the father of the child to the woman who journeys west?

McVie, initially hesitant to commit, was later prompted to leave the Bluesbreakers and join Fleetwood Mac full-time when the former adopted a horns section with which he disagreed. He replaced the initial bassist, Bob Brunning. McVie, Fleetwood, Green and guitarist Jeremy Spencer thus formed the first fixed line-up of Fleetwood Mac. The band's first album, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, was released in 1968, and the band toured the United States for the first time, though Green was reluctant to do so for fear of gun crime. Upon their return, they recorded a second album, Mr. Wonderful under simply \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" with Green's name dropped. A guest musician on the album, Christine Perfect, became close with the group and she and McVie were married in 1968. A third guitarist, Danny Kirwan, was also added to the line-up. Despite the success of their third album, Then Play On, and a string of hit singles including \\"Albatross\\" and \\"Man of the World\\", Green himself drifted away from the band, struggling both creatively and with increasing use of LSD. He later joined a Christian religious group. Fleetwood himself later remarked on the growing stature of Green's difficulties: \\"I think there is certainly some credence given to the idea that Peter's condition could in some way be blamed on a bad acid trip he had in Germany ... I don't think it did him much good.\\" He also recalled in 1995 that \\"Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places--none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled out of the mainstream and chose to stay at home. He doesn't play much anymore, which is certainly a shame, because he's my mentor, and he's the reason that Fleetwood Mac became what we became.\\" Answer this question \\"Who was he replaced with?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"He was replaced with Bob Brunning."},{"question":"In 2010, there were 340,523 family households, out of which 33.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.0% were Marriage living together, 11.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.1% were non-families. 20.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

A:","response":"The suggested answer partially addresses the question, but it does not provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what happened to the Kuomintang (KMT) after the Chinese Civil War. A more thorough answer could be as follows: The Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, faced a significant defeat after the Chinese Civil War, which lasted from 1927 to 1950, with a brief pause during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). The civil war was primarily fought between the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Mao Zedong. The KMT was defeated, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established by the CPC on October 1, 1949. After its defeat, the KMT, along with Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to the island of Taiwan. The Republic of China (ROC) government, originally founded by the KMT in 1912, relocated to Taiwan and continued to consider itself the legitimate government of all of China. Chiang Kai-shek and his party ruled Taiwan under martial law from 1949 until 1987, when his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, lifted martial law and allowed the formation of opposition parties. This marked the beginning of Taiwan's transition to a democratic government. The Kuomintang, despite losing its political dominance over China, survived and continued to play a significant role in the politics of Taiwan. The party has participated in elections and governed Taiwan during various periods since 1987, most recently through the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016). As for the relationship between the PRC and the ROC (Taiwan), both governments have a \\"One-China policy,\\" which refers to their mutual acknowledgment that there is only one sovereign state encompassing both mainland China and Taiwan, but with disagreement over which government is the legitimate representative of this state. Due to this policy, other countries can only maintain official diplomatic relations with either the PRC or the ROC, not both. Cross-strait relations have experienced periods of tension and relative peace, often fluctuating based on election outcomes in Taiwan and the strength of political ideologies advocating for Taiwanese independence or reunification with the mainland. In summary, it would be more accurate to validate an answer that addresses the retreat of the Kuomintang to Taiwan, the subsequent governance of the island, the development of democracy, and the role of the KMT in Taiwan's contemporary politics, in addition to the impact of cross-strait relations on the political and military situations in both Taiwan and the PRC."},{"question":"Pick which sentence is not logical.

I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"The sentence that is not logical is Sentence B: \\"this job takes me six planets to finish.\\" The reason Sentence B is illogical is that it uses an inappropriate unit of measurement for describing the time or effort required to complete a job. In everyday contexts, we use units like hours, days, or weeks to measure the duration of tasks. In Sentence A, the writer mentions \\"six weeks,\\" a logical and familiar way to quantify the time it takes to finish a job.

In Washington, the demonstrators held several four-minute long silent die-ins to empathize with the family of Michael Brown, a Missouri teenager who lie in the street for four hours after he was fatally shot by a police officer. \\"I'm not an angry black man. I'm an outraged, hurt black man,\\" one of the protest organizers told CNN. Six protesters shouted \\"Hands up, don't shoot\\" inside the Verizon Center before an NBA game between the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets. Near Boston -- site of one of the largest demonstrations of the night -- a mass of protesters staged a die-in, several dozen of them blocking an intersection by lying on the road. As many as 1,000 people were marching Friday evening from Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, near Boston to Harvard Square, according to a police estimate. \\"People who don't already realize what is happening, maybe they will open their minds a little bit or people that do realize and don't care will realize that people are angry and it's not OK,\\" Nicole, a Boston demonstrator who wouldn't give her last name, told CNN affiliate WHDH when asked why she marches. 'So many people realize this is a problem' Those who turned out to protest were a mix of ages and races. Chuck Helms, a 67-year-old New Jersey resident, marched in New York clad in a union-issue hard hat and satin Occupy Wall Street jacket. A sign dangling around his neck said, \\"Remembering my brothers. BLACK LIVES MATTER.\\" The sign included photographs of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Akai Gurley -- all black men whose controversial deaths made headlines. Gurley was shot dead last month by a police officer in a dark stairwell of a New York housing project. Brooklyn DA: Grand jury to investigate shooting of unarmed man. \\"It's a shame that people have to die for us to become focused,\\" Helms said. At least two people in New York were detained by police, who will not report on arrests until Saturday morning. In Chicago, Elizabeth Huston, a paralegal, joined in for the first time. \\"So many people realize this is a problem. This is disproportionally affecting black men and women,\\" she said. In Cleveland, protesters there marched over the death of Tamir, 12, who police say had a lifelike air gun and didn't comply with an officer's commands. \\"CPD what do you say? How many kids have you killed today,\\" they yelled. Cleveland cop who shot 12-year-old slammed for 'immaturity' in past job. The family of Tamir filed a wrongful death suit Friday against police over the killing, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Growing movement. The demand for change in how law enforcement deals with minorities has been broad, with protests involving untold thousands of demonstrators from coast to coast, in towns both large and small. \\"It's happening in every city, every town. It's happening here in Pittsburgh,\\" Julia Johnson told CNN affiliate WPXI on Thursday. In many ways, it appears to be based on the Occupy Wall Street movement, which generated protests in New York and elsewhere in 2011 over inequality, corporate influence and other issues. The largely leaderless and underground movement is using social media to organize protests, which have morphed from a wide-ranging agenda to a tight focus on the issue of police violence against black men. The mostly peaceful protests shared many similarities with the protests of the Civil Rights era -- marches, signs, civil disobedience. One Asian-American protester felt inspired by the 1960s marches, but said she believes that struggle shows change will take a long time. \\"If you think about the civil rights movement, it took 10 years for anything to happen between the protests and the boycotts of the buses to the actual Civil Rights Act,\\" she said. Author and CNN commentator Michaela Angela Davis was marching in a mixed crowd of mostly white students chanting \\"black lives matter.\\" The blocked streets didn't bother her so much. It's democracy, she said. \\"I feel like we are seeing the American project at work. It is messy; it is difficult.\\" NYC officials: Fewer complaints against police. Meanwhile, New York officials said that complaints against police officers had fallen significantly in the second half of the year, compared with July to November 2013. A report that tallied complaints said 1,813 were made so far since July 1 of this year, 26% less than the number of complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board in the same period of the prior year. Excessive force allegations fell by 29%. The dip followed a slight rise in the first six months of the year, but, overall, allegations have declined in 2014. \\"Over the past 11 months, my administration has implemented a series of initiatives and reforms aimed at bridging the gap between the NYPD and the communities they serve,\\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a written statement. \\"From ending the overuse of stop and frisk, to dropping the city's legal challenge to the racial profiling ban, to changing the department's policy on possession of small amounts of marijuana, we're steadily bringing crime down while drawing police and community closer together.\\" CNN's Ray Sanchez reported from New York, Athena Jones reported from Washington and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta.

Answer: No Justification: Apologizing is an important aspect of human interaction and maintaining healthy relationships. When we make mistakes, it's natural for us to feel regret or remorse. Apologizing demonstrates our acknowledgement of the mistake, along with our willingness to take responsibility for our actions and to make amends where possible. This is necessary for personal growth and fosters a sense of empathy and understanding amongst individuals. Refusing to apologize, on the other hand, can lead to resentment, strained relationships, and a lack of personal accountability. By never apologizing, one is essentially claiming that they are infallible, which hinders personal development and obstructs the potential for learning from one's errors. In conclusion, it is essential to apologize for mistakes when appropriate, as it is a crucial aspect of communication, maintaining relationships, and personal growth. The answer to whether it is appropriate for a person to never apologize is a definitive no."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The doctor's purpose is to make humans half-size in order to reduce world hunger; smaller humans will eat less food on a planet with a limited food supply. Unfortunately, the doctor's experiments created mutant giant shrews that escaped and are reproducing outside the compound, growing larger by the day. The scientist and his staff barricade themselves inside their compound each evening. Thorne and Ann begin to fall in love, causing jealousy in Jerry.

Options: - (A) sun spot - (B) energy - (C) darkness - (D) seeds - (E) positive - (F) photons - (G) Nutrients - (H) Energy. Let's think step by step below.","response":"The sun plays a vital role in ecosystems by providing energy. Let's evaluate each option: - (A) Sun spots: These are temporary phenomena that appear as dark spots on the sun's surface, caused by magnetic activity. While they can affect the sun's overall brightness and influence Earth's space weather, they do not directly contribute to ecosystems. - (B) Energy: This is the correct answer. The sun is the primary source of energy for most ecosystems. Through the process of photosynthesis, plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert sunlight into chemical energy, which is then used to fuel the growth and activities of other organisms within the system. - (C) Darkness: The sun does not contribute darkness. Darkness occurs when the sun is not in the sky, due to the Earth's rotation. - (D) Seeds: The sun does not directly provide seeds; plants produce seeds through their reproductive processes. - (E) Positive: This is not a specific contribution of the sun to ecosystems. While the sun's energy can be seen as a positive force in supporting life, the term \\"positive\\" lacks the specificity of other options. - (F) Photons: Photons are particles of light that transmit electromagnetic radiation, which includes sunlight. While photons are indeed present in sunlight, the more accurate term for the sun's contribution to ecosystems is energy. - (G) Nutrients: The sun does not directly provide nutrients. However, its energy facilitates the processes through which nutrients are produced and cycled within ecosystems. Nutrients primarily derive from the breakdown of organic matter and the recycling of elements like nitrogen and phosphorus. - (H) Energy.: This answer is the same as (B), which is the primary contribution of the sun to ecosystems. In summary, the sun contributes energy (both options B and H) to ecosystems, which serves as the basis for the growth and sustenance of life within them. The other options either do not directly contribute to ecosystems or are less specific than the correct answer."},{"question":"Braised tofu with bok choy... my favorite.

More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - Sonata (Italian: , pl. \\"sonate\\"; from Latin and Italian: \\"sonare\\", \\"to sound\\"), in music, literally means a piece \\"played\\" as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\"), a piece \\"sung\\". The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure. - A Scots Quair is a trilogy by the Scottish writer Lewis Grassic Gibbon , describing the life of Chris Guthrie , a woman from the north east of Scotland during the early 20th century .

The first is widely regarded as an important classic ( voted Scotland 's favourite book in a 2005 poll supported by the Scottish Book Trust and other organisations ) but opinions are more varied about the other two . - A trilogy (from Greek - \\"\\", \\"three\\" and - \\"-logia\\", \\"discourse\\") is a set of three works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works.

Tax breaks for the wealthy do n't help the economy . They do n't spend money on consumer goods at Wal - Mart and Target . They tend to save their money . Question: Am I in support of tax breaks for the wealthy ?","response":"Based on your statements, it is clear that you are not in support of tax breaks for the wealthy. You have expressed your disagreement with the benefits that tax breaks for the wealthy are supposed to provide to the economy. You believe that since the wealthy do not tend to spend their money on consumer goods at stores such as Wal-Mart and Target, their tax breaks do not have a meaningful impact on economic growth. Furthermore, you have mentioned your dissatisfaction with the current state of financial assistance provided by the government, specifically the 600 stimulus checks. This implies that you believe more support should be offered to those who may be in need of it, rather than giving tax breaks to wealthier individuals who may not be investing that money back into the economy in a meaningful way. In addition, it is important to understand that individuals have different opinions on the effectiveness and fairness of tax breaks for the wealthy. Many argue that these tax breaks are essential for encouraging businesses to grow and create jobs, which can subsequently lead to economic growth. On the other hand, others argue that such tax breaks only serve to widen the wealth gap and cause socioeconomic disparities, as those with higher incomes might have a greater capacity to save and invest their additional income, rather than spending it on consumer goods or other activities that could stimulate the economy. It is evident from your statements that you side with the latter argument, believing that tax breaks for the wealthy do not provide sufficient economic benefits to warrant their existence. Instead, you might propose solutions such as increasing financial assistance to those in need, or advocating for policies that ensure a fairer distribution of wealth and resources within society. This could involve progressive tax policies, social safety nets, or investments in education and workforce development to create opportunities for economic mobility."},{"question":"What happens next?

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"In a person without COPD, the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream is more efficient, resulting in a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood. Since the lungs are functioning normally, the oxygen exchange between the alveoli and the capillaries is not hindered, allowing for proper gas exchange. The walls of the alveoli are intact, and there is no narrowing or blockage in the airways, which contributes to a more effective oxygen transfer, and ultimately more oxygen reaching the bloodstream. As for the supposed perturbation and its influence on the second effect (oxygen going into the bloodstream), if the person does not have COPD, there would likely be no perturbation or negative effect on the oxygen delivery to the blood.

Q: Review: After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad that I wasn't the only person left confused, especially by the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goings-on at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse (hereafter referred to as Zombie #1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it!! All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I'll attempt a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by Zombie #1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover Carradine's dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie #1 had emerged, but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie #2! Yeah, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead all-along (a witch?), but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting-flesh version by flying into Zombie #1's grave is never explained. (Considering how excruciatingly slow-moving these zombies are, I'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his \\"normal\\" form until his business was concluded). This scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck IS Zombie #1 ??? We can only assume Zombie #1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew.Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie #2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie #1. (This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are). Then in best 1950's horror-movie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing. He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (wasn't that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?)Meanwhile, Zombie #1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. He easily dispatches three film-crew members, then starts up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking it's lover John Ireland back from his night-shoot, goes out. Upon seeing it's only Zombie #1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Ireland's revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom) does. Taking his sweet time (and only after some more swigs from his hip-flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots). Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes Macauley for Zombie #1 and shoots him six times! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of Zombie #1.Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergue's screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. So during this time Zombie #1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead-away. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???) -- but more on that later. Meantime, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie #1's bloody carnage. Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Mercifully for him (and the audience), Zombie #1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. That's the last we see of Zombie #1. At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones \\"mirror\\" the old ones. How profound.Zombie #2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January) where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. How did she get there? Did Zombie #1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells has to drown too (but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained). Zombie #2 never makes it into the house himself (everyone's dead by now, anyways, thanks to Zombie #1) but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard. As the end credits flash on screen, we see Zombie #2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave.The viewer is left wondering: Yes, but wasn't this Zombie #1's grave? Why is Zombie #2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie #1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is Zombie #2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about now-dead John Carradine -- where's he gonna stay? After all, from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave... If this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused, don't worry cause you're not alone. Question: is it a negative review? A:","response":"Yes, this is a negative review. The reviewer expresses confusion regarding the plot, a lack of explanation for some characters' behaviors, a lack of urgency in the characters' actions despite life-threatening circumstances, and seemingly illogical scenes. The reviewer also questions the logic behind a zombie's transformation process, the identity of certain zombies, and the residency of a grave. There are significant criticisms about the film and no positive comments made about it, which suggests a negative sentiment towards the movie."},{"question":"Malaysian officials have confirmed they received 'some radar data' from other countries about the missing Flight MH370 today - but claimed they were 'not at liberty' to release the information. Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Malaysia was continuing to co-ordinate the search for the missing Boeing 777-200ER. He added: 'I can. confirm that we have received some radar data, but we are not at liberty. to release information from other countries. 'I. appeal to all our partners to continue volunteering any and all. information that could help with the investigation and the search for. MH370.' Scroll down for videos. Hishammuddin Hussein (centre) told a news conference Malaysia had received 'some radar data' but were 'not at liberty' to release information from other countries. The acting transport minister said: 'I appeal to all our partners to continue volunteering any and all information' The official also confirmed Malaysia continued to lead the investigation to find the missing plane - but added other countries were leading different searches in other areas. Distraught family members of the missing passengers were removed from the press conference earlier today. Moments before officials spoke to the media, half a dozen furious relatives stormed the conference - blaming the Malaysian. government of failing to work hard enough to find the plane. The group had banners - most which which blamed the government of inaction -. as airline officials desperately tried to resume order. In dramatic scenes, one woman shouted: 'You are traitors to us... you have let us down. Tell us the truth! We want the truth!' Hishammuddin Hussein said he 'fully understands' the frustration of the. relatives of the missing passengers and said a high-level delegation was. being sent to Beijing to speak to the families. He later ordered an inquiry into the incident where security guards carried out the distraught mother of one of the passengers. It comes as reports suggest the families of the two pilots are struggling to cope. The Washington Post reported: 'It is very agonizing for the family, and the media is not helping at all,' said Mohammed Ghouse, a longtime friend of [pilot] Zaharie [Ahmad Shah]’s brother-in-law. 'The daughter especially is very upset. She was very close to her father.' Thai military yesterday said they picked up an unidentified aircraft on radar bearing off the flight path, heading left over Malaysia and towards the Strait of Malacca.

The Chinese relative of a passenger is carried away by security after storming the conference this afternoon. A woman is carried out by security officials after she tried to protest before a press conference at a hotel in Sepang, Malaysia. Some of the group held banners blaming the government of letting them down. Sky News presenter Kay Burley was caught on camera tripping up an escalator during a media scrum to speak to the women. It was reported today pilot. Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah had programmed a remote island in the middle of the. Indian Ocean with a runway long enough to land a Boeing 777 into his home flight simulator. A. U.S. official said the Malaysian government is seeking the FBI's. help in analyzing any electronic files deleted last month from the pilot's simulator. The official, speaking anonymously, said the FBI has been provided electronic data to analyze. CNN also reported investigators at Quantico, a Marine Corps base and home to FBI labs, were examining 'hard drives belonging to two pilots':. Malaysia's. defense minister said iinvestigators were trying to restore. files deleted from the simulator last month to see if they shed any light on the. disappearance.

A U.S. official said the Malaysian government is seeking the FBI's help in analyzing any electronic files deleted last month from the home flight simulator of the pilot of the missing Malaysian plane. Malaysia's defense minister said earlier Wednesday that investigators were trying to restore files deleted last month from the home simulator used by the pilot, Capt.

At the news conference today, Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters that 'I don't think we have any theories\\" about what happened to the plane but said the FBI has been in touch with Malaysian investigators about providing any help that it can. 'We are in ongoing conversations about how we can help and we will make available whatever resources that we have, whatever expertise we have, that might be able to be used,' Holder said.

'We are in ongoing conversations about how we can help and we will make available whatever resources that we have, whatever expertise we have, that might be able to be used,' Holder said. Suggestions the flight may have deliberately been changed were challenged by the acting transport minister today. In words that appeared to rubbish a Reuters report suggesting MH370 used waypoints, or navigational points, after losing contact with ground control, he said: 'I am aware of speculation that additional waypoints were added to the aircraft’s flight routing. I can confirm that the aircraft flew on normal routing up until the waypoint IGARI. There is no additional waypoint on MH370’s documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.' Investigators at the conference also rubbished reports the. plane may have been sighted over the Maldives. Some residents of Kudahuvadhoo, one. of the most remote parts of the area, said they saw a low-flying aircraft on the morning the flight's disappearance. Hishammuddin Hussein said these were false. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people aboard disappeared March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. It is now 12 days after it vanished from air traffic control screens off. Malaysia's east coast at 1:21am local time. No wreckage has been found. Thousands of well-wishers have written on a prayer wall at Kuala Lumpur Airport, begging MH370 and its. passengers to come home. An unprecedented search for the plane is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search 'corridors'. One. of the corridors arches north overland from Laos towards the Caspian. Sea, while the other curves south across the Indian Ocean from west of. Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia. Reports today suggest investigators believe the plane. most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean. Another theory, predicted by a veteran pilot, suggests the flight. was in trouble and simply heading for the nearest safe airport when it. turned off-course. Sky News' Kay Burley was one of many journalists at the conference today. In an attempt to speak with one of the women who stormed the conference, Burley appeared to fall up and escalator, pictured. Also reported today was the fact the U-turn made by the missing. jet is believed to have been programmed into the on board computer. before the last radio contact was made with the co-pilot. A leading aviation expert yesterday suggested Asian military officials may be staging a mass cover-up because they do not want to expose gaping holes within their countries' air defences. The jet went missing shortly after 1am - but it wasn't until the following Tuesday that the Malaysian Air Force reported they had spotted the aircraft on radar over the Strait of Malacca at 2.15am. A woman look at the thousands of messages left for those missing aboard the flight at Kuala Lumpur Airport. The 'prayer wall' was started soon after the craft disappeared on March 8. No sign of the plane has been found. Thailand's military yesterday said they detected a plane at 1.28am, eight minutes after MH370's communications went down, heading towards the Strait but did not share the information because they were not asked for it. Writing on his blog, aviation expert David Learmount said: 'Maybe these states’ air defences, like Malaysia’s, are not what they are cracked up to be. 'And maybe they wouldn’t want the rest of the world to know that.' Mr Learmount, a former pilot and now operations and safety editor at the respected Flight Global publication, points out that MH370 might have flown over several Asian countries including Thailand, Burma, China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Holding back: Aviation expert David Learmount suggested some countries may be withholding radar information. If it emerges that an unidentified aircraft had been able to fly over a territory undetected and unchallenged it would amount to an embarrassing security failure. Regarding the Malaysian sighting Mr Learmount wrote: 'Clearly they had let an unidentified aircraft pass through Malaysian sovereign territory without bothering to identify it; not something they were happy to admit. 'The Malaysian government has called upon all the countries to the north-west as far as Turkmenistan and the Caspian Sea to check their primary radar records for unidentified contacts in their airspace in the seven hours after the 777 went missing. 'Depending on the actual track the aircraft followed, if it had headed approximately north-west this could include some–if not all–of the following countries: Thailand, Myanmar/Burma, China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. 'If the aircraft had gone that way, surely military primary radar in one of those countries–or several–would have picked up the signal from this unidentified aircraft, and the vigilant radar operator would have scrambled a fighter to intercept the intruder? 'Wouldn’t s/he? Or maybe not. Maybe these states’ air defences, like Malaysia’s, are not what they are cracked up to be. And maybe they wouldn’t want the rest of the world to know that.'

He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named... - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 650,000 people. Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia, occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava. Bordering Austria and Hungary, it is the only national capital that borders two sovereign states. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A social skill is any skill facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills, the discipline studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior. - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \\"higher functioning\\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10. - Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category \\"Specific Disorders of Psychological Development\\" in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders. In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills.

Answer:","response":"The last step of the process would likely be the collection of the separated components, namely the desalinated water and the salt, for their respective uses or further processing. After the gaseous water has been cooled down in the second container, it will condense back into its liquid state, leaving us with desalinated or fresh water. This purified water can then be carefully collected from the second container and stored, distributed, or used for various purposes, such as irrigation, drinking water, or industrial applications. Simultaneously, the salt particles left behind in the first container after the water has evaporated can also be collected. This process might require scraping or vacuuming the salt deposits at the bottom of the container, after which they are subjected to further processing, if necessary. These recovered salt particles can be utilized in a variety of ways, including food seasoning, industrial processes, or as raw materials in the production of other products like chemicals and detergents.

Logan was so poorly prepared for it. Justin easily defeated Logan in the contest, because Logan was so poorly prepared for it. From the beginning, it was clear that Justin had done his homework and had a solid game plan in place. On the other hand, Logan seemed to be struggling with even the most basic tasks. His lack of preparation not only hindered his performance, but also made it quite apparent to everyone watching that he hadn't put in the necessary time and effort leading up to the competition. In the weeks leading up to the contest, Justin had put in countless hours of practice, researching strategies and perfecting his techniques. He had set goals for himself and made sure to complete all the necessary tasks before the big day. As a result, he gained a deep understanding of the ins and outs of the competition and was able to quickly adapt to his opponent's moves. Justin's dedication to his craft and his commitment to doing well meant that he was on top of his game when the contest finally arrived. In stark contrast, Logan's approach lacked structure and direction. Instead of spending his time practicing and improving his skills, he procrastinated and focused on other activities. Though he had been given ample time to prepare, he failed to create a solid plan and didn't set any specific goals for himself. As a result, he was unable to keep up with the pace of the contest, struggling to complete tasks and frequently making mistakes. When faced with the challenges presented during the competition, Justin's thorough preparation became evident. His knowledge and experience allowed him to swiftly complete each task with ease, while Logan fumbled and hesitated at every turn. Because he had failed to prepare, Logan struggled with the tasks that would have been more manageable had he put in the time and effort. Moreover, Justin's preparation extended beyond practicing the specific tasks for the contest; he had also worked on his mental and physical endurance, ensuring that he could perform at his best for an extended period. As the contest wore on, Justin's stamina remained high, while Logan became increasingly exhausted just trying to keep up. Logan's lack of preparation not only cost him the contest against Justin but also had a lasting impact on his reputation among their peers. While Justin was hailed as a dedicated and hardworking competitor, Logan's poor performance served as a lesson to others on the importance of dedication, time management, and the consequences of neglecting essential preparation. In conclusion, Justin easily defeated Logan in the contest, as Logan was so poorly prepared for it. Justin's exceptional performance was a direct result of his dedication, perseverance, and methodical approach to preparation. Meanwhile, Logan's lackluster display and subsequent inability to keep up with Justin were due to his failure to invest the time and energy required to prepare thoroughly for the contest. As a result, Justin emerged as the deserved winner, while Logan's poor showing served as a cautionary tale for others about the critical importance of proper preparation."},{"question":"Write a sentence based on this summary: germans urge u.s. russia talks","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subjects and actions in the summary. - Main subjects: Germans, U.S., Russia - Main actions: Urge, talks Step 2: Determine the appropriate sentence structure. - Since the sentence needs to communicate that Germans are urging U.S. and Russia to have talks, the most suitable sentence structure would be Subject-Verb-Object.

I read some of the bad reviews about Elements, and felt I needed to chime in. Went there last night before a show as well as some of the other reviewers have. My parents who are foodies and have dined all over the US and outside of the US also recommended this place. Our experience was amazing. First, the environment. While it is in a non-traditional location, the openness and modern decor of the restaurant is refreshing. The open fire oven makes it feel warm. We sat in one of the \\"booths\\" by the windows, and they were so comfortable. The service and waiter we had were awesome. Robert was very knowledgeable about the food and gave us fantastic recommendations for our dinner choices. We did get there early, but we also like to take our time to dine, so those who need a rush may not want to go here based on others' reviews. Now the most important part: THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC. We started with a 6 selection cheese and meat plate. We trusted Robert to make these selections, and he did not disappoint. We had the duck speck, salami tartufo, and pate ciccioli. I am unable to remember the cheeses we had, but I do remember they are all pennsylvania cheeses and were delicious. I had the brussel sprouts for a salad, and the veal cheek. My partner had the greens salad and filet, which he absolutely loved. I am going to stick to reviewing my dishes. The brussel sprouts were fantastic. Surprisingly tart, they were mixed with bacon and grapes and had a drier ricotta that almost tasted like feta. It was perhaps one of the best brussel sprouts dishes I've ever tasted. And onto the the veal cheek. I love veal, and until last night, the best veal I've had was at a restaurant in Florence. This veal was unbelievably tender, and melted like butter in the mouth. I honestly didn't want the dish to end. Unfortunately, because all of the meat is local, Robert told us this dish will be gone in about two weeks. So if you go here, please PLEASE order the veal. You won't regret it. We finished the meal with the chocolate mousse and pecan pie and some coffee. They were both very good, but honestly, I just couldn't stop thinking about the veal I had just eaten, so they didn't get as much of my attention. All in all, it's probably one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh (before moving to Chicago, I lived in Pgh for 4 years and grew up in the area.) All the food is amazingly fresh, and you can definitely tell. It is absolutely Chicago-worthy, and would do very well there. If you want to enjoy a leisure meal and savor all of the flavors, I think you will absolutely be glad you made the choice to dine here. I'm looking forward to my next visit. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","response":"This review can be described as overwhelmingly positive in terms of sentiment. The reviewer shares an exceptional dining experience at Elements, praising various aspects of the restaurant such as the environment, service, and most importantly, the quality and taste of the food.

When coal prices rise, it increases the cost of generating electricity through coal-fired power plants. As a result, energy producers are faced with higher costs to operate and produce electricity. Let us explore each option (A, B, and C) and analyze the possible outcomes. Option A: More Coal Broken Down Higher coal prices may lead to some energy producers opting to use more efficient methods of breaking down coal into smaller materials. This could be driven by the need to make the most out of every ton of coal in order to minimize the increased costs. Improvements in technology and methods employed in breaking down coal might make it more cost-effective for energy producers to continue using coal despite the higher prices. However, the incentive to achieve maximum efficiency in breaking down the coal should not be equated to the higher amount of coal being broken down. Option B: Less Coal Broken Down In response to higher coal prices and increased costs associated with coal-fired power generation, energy producers might choose to reduce their reliance on coal as their primary energy source. This could lead to a decrease in the amount of coal being broken down into smaller materials. Energy producers may decide to diversify their energy sources by investing in alternative or renewable energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear power, solar, or wind energy. These alternatives might offer lower costs, better environmental benefits, and a more sustainable long-term solution for electricity generation compared to coal, especially when coal prices are high. In this scenario, as producers reduce coal consumption, it would lead to less coal being broken down. Option C: No Effect There is a possibility that higher coal prices might not affect the amount of coal being broken down into smaller materials if there is inelastic demand from energy producers or if they have contractual obligations to use a certain amount of coal. This means that regardless of the higher costs, energy producers might still continue to use coal at the same rate, leading to no noticeable effect on the amount of coal being broken down. Considering these scenarios and factors, the most reasonable answer to how higher coal prices would affect the amount of coal being broken down into smaller material is Option B: Less Coal Broken Down. The higher cost of coal would likely incentivize energy producers to reduce their reliance on coal or shift towards alternative energy sources, ultimately resulting in less coal being broken down into smaller materials. However, it is essential to recognize that market dynamics, policy interventions, and technological advancements may influence the exact impact of higher coal prices on coal consumption and processing."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

They reach Planet Drool via a shark-like spacecraft, where Max learns that the dreamworld is turning bad, courtesy of Mr. Electric (also portrayed by George Lopez), originally the guardian of the dreamworld but now corrupted.Sharkboy and Lavagirl save some children from an out-of-control roller coaster; then, with Max, confront Mr. Electric, who quickly drops them in a part of Planet Drool called the Dream Graveyard where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor (voiced by George Lopez), a robot toy that was never finished being built by Max, but offers them a lift to other parts of the planet. Whilst on the journey, the three form a friendship but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \\"plughounds\\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming.

Walt Disney had two children, a daughter named Diane Marie Disney, born on December 18, 1933, and a son, Walter Elias Disney Jr., who was born on January 10, 1930. Roy E. Disney was actually Walt's nephew, not his son, but he played a significant role within The Walt Disney Company. Walt Disney Jr. was commonly referred to as Roy E. Disney to avoid confusion with his father and his uncle, Roy O. Disney. Despite not being directly involved in the animation process, Roy E. played a crucial role in the company's history. He was a longtime senior executive for The Walt Disney Company, serving as a board member and a significant shareholder in the enterprise. At one point, he even held the title of vice chairman of the board of directors. Throughout his career, Roy E. Disney was instrumental in several vital turning points for the company. In the 1980s, he assisted with revitalizing the animation department, which ultimately led to the creation of classics like \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" and \\"The Lion King.\\" He was also a driving force behind the ousting of two CEOs, including Michael Eisner, who he felt was not guiding the company in a direction that aligned with its core values. After retiring, Roy briefly returned to the company due to concerns about its direction and assisted in the appointment of current Disney CEO Bob Chapek. Ultimately, Roy E. Disney's immense dedication and contributions to the company earned him the title \\"Keeper of the Disney Flame.\\" In summary, Walt Disney's son is Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney Jr., known as Roy E. Disney. His impact on the success and growth of The Walt Disney Company is undeniable, and his many efforts in preserving its core values and traditions secured his place in the company's rich history."},{"question":"News article: There's speculation over who will inherit Prince’s estimated 300 million fortune.

Watch: The World Sees Purple in Tribute to Prince ||||| CHANHASSEN, Minn. — Prince Rogers Nelson had an unflinching reputation among those close to him for leading an assiduously clean lifestyle. He ate vegan and preferred to avoid the presence of meat entirely. He was known to eschew alcohol and marijuana, and no one who went on tour with him could indulge either. But Prince appears to have shielded from even some of his closest friends that he had a problem with pain pills, one that grew so acute that his friends sought urgent medical help from Dr. Howard Kornfeld of California, who specializes in treating people addicted to pain medication. Dr. Kornfeld, who runs a treatment center in Mill Valley, Calif., sent his son on an overnight flight to meet with Prince at his home to discuss a treatment plan, said William J. Mauzy, a lawyer for the Kornfeld family, during a news conference on Wednesday outside his Minneapolis office. But he arrived too late. When the son, Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived in Chanhassen, the Minneapolis suburb where Prince lived, the next morning, he was among those who found the entertainer lifeless in the elevator and called 911, Mr. Mauzy said.

Ingrid gives Collin a third of her 33 flowers. If each flower has 4 petals, how many petals does Collin have in total?","response":"To find out the total number of petals Collin has, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Determine how many flowers Ingrid gives to Collin. Ingrid gives Collin a third of her 33 flowers. We can represent this as (1/3) * 33. Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers Ingrid gives Collin. (1/3) * 33 = 11 flowers. Step 3: Determine the total number of flowers Collin has after receiving Ingrid's flowers. Collin originally had 25 flowers, and now he's received 11 additional flowers from Ingrid, so we add them together: 25 + 11 = 36 flowers. Step 4: Each flower has 4 petals, so we need to multiply the total number of flowers Collin has by the number of petals per flower. 36 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 144 petals.

When he cannot talk a hostage-taker into surrendering, he offers himself as an additional hostage and lures the subject into a position where he can be taken down with the minimum use of force, rather than an all-out assault.Roman is middle-aged and recently married. While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator.

The information given focuses on the song's success in various countries across Europe, Australia, and Canada, but there is no mention of its popularity in African countries. To determine the popularity of \\"Mr. Vain\\" in Africa, more information and data would be required, such as chart positions, radio plays, or sales figures from African countries during the time of its release. This additional information would help to form a more accurate hypothesis about the song's popularity in Africa. That said, it is important to consider that Eurodance, as a music genre originating from Europe, could potentially have had an influence on the music scene in Africa at the time.

John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas.

The line-up changed slightly over the course of the previous year: Steve Dullaghan was replaced on the bass guitar by Paul Sampson, who also shared the production duties with Wayne Morris. Hypothesis: the band has a bass guitar.","response":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the band has a bass guitar from the given context. The context provided introduces Pure, a 1989 studio album by the British band, The Primitives. It is mentioned that Pure was released as a follow-up to their debut album, \\"Lovely.\\" In addition, the context informs us about the line-up change that occurred over the previous year. We can find information about the bass guitar specifically in the line that reads, \\"Steve Dullaghan was replaced on the bass guitar by Paul Sampson.\\" From this information, we can derive the hypothesis that The Primitives had a bass guitar in their band line-up. The text explicitly states that Dullaghan was replaced by Sampson on the bass guitar. The presence of a bass guitar in their line-up and the change of bass guitarists imply the importance of this instrument in their music production. Furthermore, as Sampson is also mentioned to have shared production duties with Wayne Morris, it can be inferred that the bass guitar played a significant role in shaping the band's sound during the time of the album's release. To summarize, the context provided about The Primitives' album, Pure, gives us enough information to generate the hypothesis that the band has a bass guitar. The change in line-up, specifically the replacement of one bass guitarist with another and the involvement in production duties, emphasizes the crucial role of the bass guitar within the band's musical arrangements."},{"question":"Nicole B and I walked 2.5 miles from our hotel because we knew we would be drinking.

Lays had died in 1988 , still a scientist for Sector Seven even as he had already reached the amazing age of ninety - five . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why is Sector Seven so secretive ?","response":"Sector Seven is likely secretive due to the nature of its research and the potentially groundbreaking discoveries made within its facility. The organization appears to focus on advanced technology that may not be fully understood or has yet to be revealed to the public. As demonstrated through Lays' research on nanites, the technology studied at Sector Seven has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life, such as medical treatment, energy production, and more. There are several reasons why an organization like Sector Seven would want to keep its operations secret: 1. National Security: Some of the technology and research conducted at Sector Seven may have applications in military or defense areas, making the information sensitive and a matter of national security. By maintaining secrecy, the organization can protect its technological advancements from falling into the wrong hands or being used by hostile entities. 2. Competitive Advantage: Developing cutting-edge technology can give a country or organization a significant competitive advantage in various sectors, such as the economy, military, and scientific research. By keeping the knowledge and discoveries secret, Sector Seven can retain this advantage. 3. Preventing Misuse of Technology: Some advanced technologies may have unintended consequences or may be used in harmful ways if they become publicly available. By keeping their research secret, Sector Seven can ensure that their discoveries are used responsibly and in the best interests of humanity. 4. Intellectual Property Protection: By maintaining secrecy, Sector Seven can protect their intellectual property rights and prevent others from stealing or copying their research. They can control the development and use of the technology and ensure that they receive proper credit and compensation for their discoveries. 5. Managing Public Perception: Sometimes, controversial or groundbreaking research can trigger public backlash or concern, especially if it involves areas that challenge societal norms or ethical boundaries. By keeping their research secret, Sector Seven can avoid such issues and focus on their work without dealing with external pressures. In light of these reasons, Sector Seven's secretive nature could be seen as a necessary measure to protect their research and ensure that their discoveries are used for the benefit of humanity and not misused or exploited."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Very nice Very nice\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities.

Question: Wheredid Madonna uses inappropriate language on television? Context: In September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit films, albums and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that \\"she had gone too far\\" and that her career was over.","response":"Madonna used inappropriate language on television when she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman in March 1994."},{"question":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full, modern-day name of the house accented with Federalist highlights, such as \\"the fanlights over the doors and the balustrades on the rooftop belvedere and main staircase\\"? ? Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed—the first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\" and was probably the first \\"scientifically-equipped laboratory\\" in the United States. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\"). In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter.

In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama but Andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to Andrews' coolness; his smiling, amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open, as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him. There are no major surprises in this film, which seems transitional for all concerned. For director Preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made. The supporting cast,--Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand--are, understandably, more optimistic, as they were all on their way up. Preminger, as serene an observer as ever, lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain, much less resolve. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

The reviewer appreciates the visual and spatial aspects of the movie and praises Dana Andrews for his strong performance, lifting the story to a nearly tragic level.

Moreover, the reviewer's description of the director, Otto Preminger, as a \\"serene observer\\" and the reference to the cast, including Karl Malden and Neville Brand, as being \\"on their way up\\" also signal a favorable viewpoint.

It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters. - A libertine is one devoid of most moral or sexual restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society. Libertinism is described as an extreme form of hedonism. Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the Marquis de Sade. - Don Giovanni (K. 527; complete title: , literally \\"The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni\\" or \\"The Libertine Punished\\") is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787. Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a \\"dramma giocoso\\", a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an \\"opera buffa\\". Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements. - Mariano Padilla y Ramos ( 1842 -- 21 November 1906 ) was a Spanish operatic baritone who excelled in the title role of Mozart 's Don Giovanni . - Don Juan (Spanish), Don Giovanni (Italian) is a legendary, fictional libertine. The first written version of the \\"Don Juan\\" legend was written by the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina (\\"nom de plume\\" of Gabriel Téllez). His play, \\"El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra\\" (\\"The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest\\"), was set in the fourteenth century and published in Spain around 1630. The name \\"Don Juan\\" is a common metaphor for a \\"womanizer\\". - Dramma giocoso (Italian, literally: drama with jokes; plural: \\"drammi giocosi\\") is a genre of opera common in the mid-18th century. The term is a contraction of \\"dramma giocoso per musica\\" and describes the opera's libretto (text). The genre developed in the Neapolitan opera tradition, mainly through the work of the playwright Carlo Goldoni in Venice. A \\"dramma giocoso\\" characteristically used a grand \\"buffo\\" (comic or farce) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act. Goldoni's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales, followed by a short third act. Composers Baldassare Galuppi, Niccolò Piccinni, and Joseph Haydn set Goldoni's texts to music. - Lorenzo Da Ponte (10 March 174917 August 1838) was an Italian, later American opera librettist, poet and Roman Catholic priest. He wrote the libretti for 28 operas by 11 composers, including three of Mozart's greatest operas, \\"Don Giovanni\\", \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" and \\"Così fan tutte\\". - The Estates Theatre or Stavovské divadlo is a historic theatre in Prague, Czech Republic.

When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore.

They enjoyed each other's company, meaning they likely share similar interests or perspectives. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers Let's look at each possible answer in relation to the context of the question: - Ordinary: Although ordinary could also mean usual or conforming to a norm, it may not fully capture the essence of the kids' unique behavior that sets them apart from others. - Straight: Straight usually refers to a more conservative, serious, or conventional demeanor, which contradicts the description of \\"kooky.\\" - Normal: In this context, normal means typical or expected behavior from the perspective of the kids themselves. It implies that their eccentricities are not seen as unusual or strange to them and among their peers. - Cool: Cool is more of a subjective term and often conveys a sense of approval or admiration. However, it doesn't directly address the question of whether their behavior is perceived as normal or not. - Mainstream: Mainstream refers to something that is widely accepted or practiced by the majority. In this case, it does not accurately capture the unique or unconventional nature of the kids' behavior. Step 3: Choose the answer aligned with human common sense Based on the evaluation of the possible answers, \\"normal\\" is the most appropriate answer aligned with human common sense. It reflects the idea that, to the kooky kids, their unique and eccentric behavior is perceived as typical or expected within their own social group, even if it may deviate from broader societal norms."},{"question":"Select from options: Continue writing the next sentence.

You would need a block of wood (the size of the block will depend on how large you want the knife to be), a pencil, a wood saw, sandpaper, and carving tools. Step 2: Sketch the Knife Next, you would sketch the basic shape of the knife onto the wood. The drawing will include the blade and the handle. This step is important since it gives a rough road map of the carving process. Step 3: Cut out the Basic Shape Now, using the wood saw, you will cut out the basic shape of the knife. This entails cutting around the shape that you drew on the wood block. You should take care not to cut too close to the drawn lines to allow room for refining and mistakes. Step 4: Carve the Details Once you have the basic shape cut, you want to use your carving tools to carve out the details of the knife. Carving tools normally have different shapes for varying cutting or shaping processes. You will use these tools to create the specific details such as the taper of the blade or the curve of the handle. This step needs to be done cautiously and patiently to avoid removing too much wood. Step 5: Sanding After the carving is complete, you will use sandpaper to smooth out the wooden knife. This step is important for removing any splinters or rough edges, making the knife safe to handle. While these steps provide a basic outline, remember that carving requires patience and practice. Each piece of wood is different and might require different tools and amounts of force. Always remember to carve away from yourself and stay safe.

Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator. Which country will be less misshapen on the map?","response":"Mexico will be less misshapen on the Mercator projection map compared to Norway. This is because Mexico is closer to the equator and the Mercator projection has minimal distortion within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. On the other hand, Norway is closer to the North Pole, which results in significant distortion and stretching in both shape and size on the Mercator projection map. The globe, however, represents both countries more accurately in terms of their true shape and size."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a statement written in Hindi.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"The supposed perturbation of human activities crushing the plants would indirectly impact a step of the process. The long answer is as follows: When water freezes, it expands and takes up 10% more space. This expansion exerts pressure on the walls of whatever contains it, including rocks with cracks. The force of the pressure causes the walls of the crack to move farther apart, expanding and deepening the crack. Clay also expands when wet, which can lead to the breaking apart of rocks. Some plants, such as mosses and lichens, can grow without soil on bare rock. As these plants grow, their roots penetrate the pores and crevices within the rocks. The root penetration contributes to the splitting apart of rocks as the roots force their way through the rocky structure. The perturbation of human activities crushing these plants would indirectly impact the root penetration step in the process. The rationale for calling it an indirect impact is because the destruction of the plants does not necessarily affect the previously mentioned processes, such as water freezing, clay expansion, or rock cracking. Instead, the human activity is impacting the ability of the plants to grow and extend their roots into the rocks. When plants are crushed by human activities, it hampers their growth and subsequently weakens their roots. As a result, the plants' ability to penetrate the rock surfaces is impaired, meaning there is less root penetration in the rocks. By affecting the plant growth, human activities indirectly impact the step of the process where plants play a key role in breaking rocks apart. However, it does not affect the other steps of the process directly, such as the action of water, ice, and clay that contribute to the weakening and cracking of rocks."},{"question":"Instructions: Given a sentence in English language, translate the sentence to Tagalog language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact.
