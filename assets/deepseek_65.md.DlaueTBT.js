Born Thomas Lanier Williams III on March 26, 1911, in Columbus, Mississippi, Tennessee Williams is regarded as one of the most important figures in 20th-century American theater. Williams adopted the pen name \\"Tennessee\\" in honor of his Southern heritage and the state where his ancestors had lived. 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' premiered on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre on March 24, 1955, and was directed by the legendary Elia Kazan. The play was the recipient of the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and enjoyed widespread critical and commercial success. The narrative of 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' revolves around the Pollitt family, who gathers at their Mississippi plantation to celebrate Big Daddy's birthday. Unbeknownst to him, Big Daddy is dying of cancer, and the internal conflicts and tensions among family members escalate as they vie for control over the estate. The play's central characters, Brick and his wife Maggie, experience a strained marriage due to Brick's alcoholism and Maggie's infidelity accusations. Themes such as morality, mendacity, repressed sexuality, and the crumbling facade of the American Dream are intricately woven into the story. Aside from 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,' Tennessee Williams is also well-known for other notable works such as 'A Streetcar Named Desire,' 'The Glass Menagerie,' and 'Suddenly, Last Summer.' His plays are distinguished by their poetic style, vivid characters, and exploration of complex human emotions. They often tackle controversial and taboo subjects, which, during his time, made Williams a groundbreaking playwright. Throughout his illustrious career, Tennessee Williams received numerous accolades and critical acclaim for his contributions to the American theater landscape. He passed away on February 25, 1983, in New York City, but his work continues to resonate with audiences worldwide, ensuring his lasting influence in the realm of drama and literature."},{"question":"Write a summary based on this article: This undated image provide by Wendy's shows the fast food company's new logo.

(Associated Press) For the first time since 1983, the Dublin, Ohio-based fast food company is updating its logo in a move intended to signal its ongoing transformation into a higher-end hamburger chain. Instead of the boxy, old-fashioned lettering against a red-and-yellow backdrop, the pared down new look features the chain's name in a casual red font against a clean white backdrop. An image of the smiling, cartoon girl in red pigtails floats above _ though this girl looks more vivid and not quite as childlike. In an interview with The Associated Press, CEO Emil Brolick said the current logo had served the company well for the past three decades, but that it was time for an update. Still, Brolick said he was encouraged by consumer feedback in testing dozens of new logo variations over the past several months. \\"When we pushed things too far, they very much reeled us back,\\" he said, noting that it showed just how attached people are to the brand. It's only the fifth logo update since founder Dave Thomas opened the first Wendy's in 1969, and perhaps the most significant. The makeover comes as the chain known for its square burgers and chocolate Frosty shakes struggles to redefine itself in the face of intensifying competition from the likes of Panera Bread Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which are seen as a step up from traditional fast food. Wendy's push has intensified since Brolick came on as CEO about a year ago. In addition to raising perceptions about its food, Brolick is focusing on renovating outdated restaurants with a look that features natural lighting, flat-screen TVs and a variety of seating options, including cushy chairs in nooks. The idea is to create a more inviting atmosphere where consumers feel they can relax. Starting in March, Wendy's says the updated logo will start appearing on newly built and renovated restaurants. It's still far from clear whether Wendy's broader reinvention will succeed. But sales at its restaurants open at least a year have edged up for the last five quarters. Craig Bahner, the company's chief marketing officer, notes that all brands need to evolve. \\"It's a tangible signal of change,\\" Bahner said. The Wendy's name and original logo were inspired by founder Dave Thomas' daughter, whose real name is Melinda Lou (her siblings couldn't pronounce her name when they were younger, so they called her \\"Wenda,\\" which turned into \\"Wendy\\"). Thomas thought the name conjured the image of the wholesome hamburger restaurant he dreamed of opening. In his book \\"Dave's Way,\\" Thomas recalls how the family dressed up Wendy, then 8 years old, in a blue-and-white striped dress for the opening of the first location. To make her pigtails stick out, they put pipe cleaners in her hair. That's roughly the image of the little freckle-faced girl in the logo. In undertaking the redesign, the company realized there were three key elements that had to be preserved; the image of the little girl, the color red and the way the \\"Wendy's\\" font swerves up _ what executives call \\"the wave.\\" In the new logo, Bahner notes that Wendy's pigtails peek out from the oval frame, bringing her forward and making her more dynamic. The logo will be part of the new restaurant design that Wendy's is looking to expand to its roughly 6,000 locations in North America. Brolick has noted that the revamps \\"enhance all dimensions of the Wendy's experience\\" and that renovated locations see a 25 percent bump in sales. By 2015, Wendy's plans to have half its 1,425 company-owned locations updated. Ultimately, Brolick wants the company to be seen as a \\"top-end\\" fast-food chain _ better quality than McDonald's, but perhaps not at the same level as Panera. \\"Our goal is to be a five-star restaurant at a three-star price,\\" he said. Building on the introduction of its sweet baked potato and Bacon Portabella Melt cheeseburger this year, the company is looking at introducing whole wheat buns and flatbreads. Brolick says those type of small adjustments can have a big impact on perceptions about the healthfulness and quality of the chain's food. The changes are even extending to employee uniforms, which will be updated next year to have a more tailored look. The early feedback is positive and Brolick says workers like them _ so much so that they even feel comfortable wearing them outside the restaurant. ___ Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||","response":"For the first time since 1983, Wendy's, the Dublin, Ohio-based fast food company, is updating its logo as part of its transformation into a higher-end hamburger chain.

Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

Spelt flour is indeed derived from spelt, which is a hexaploid wheat that has six sets of chromosomes. Spelt, scientifically known as Triticum spelta, is an ancient grain that has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is a relative of modern wheat, but it has different properties and nutritional qualities. Spelt flour has begun to gain popularity in recent times as an alternative to traditional wheat flour. It has a nutty and slightly sweet flavor, which makes it suitable for various recipes, including bread, pasta, and baked goods. The flour has a higher protein and fiber content compared to common wheat flour, contributing to its growing popularity among those seeking more nutritious alternatives in their diet. Furthermore, those with slight intolerance to wheat find spelt flour more digestible, as it contains a different type of gluten compared to modern wheat. However, it should be noted that spelt flour is not suitable for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. In summary, the suggested answer correctly describes spelt flour as coming from a hexaploid wheat with six sets of chromosomes.

Arie Eddy, 18, has been struggling to find a job for almost three years and only managed to secure one job interview during that time. As youth unemployment continues to rise across Australia, more and more young people are struggling to find work. In Victoria the number of individuals under the age of 24 without work has hit a 15-year high, while in Queensland unemployment is also on the rise according to the ABS. Arie Eddy, from Warrnambool on the south-west coast of Victoria - about 260 kilometres from Melbourne, has been searching unsuccessfully for work for almost three years. 'It constantly makes me feel worthless. It makes me feel like I don't have any purpose and every day is hard to get through. I feel like I have no need to be around if I haven't got a job,' Arie told The Age. After leaving school in Hamilton at 16 to move south in search of a new life, the 18-year-old joined the military. However four months in he was forced out because he suffers from severe asthma. Victorian Council of Social Service chief executive Emma King told the publication the situation is also dire for graduates. 'They are continually told they don't have enough experience. We have a very competitive job market, they have done all the right things in terms of education,' she said. Over the past few years Arie estimated he'd applied for more than 780 jobs, but only secured one interview and remains unemployed. Youth unemployment rates are on the rise in many states, with the worst hit being Tasmania, followed by QLD. As a requirement of his youth allowance from Centrelink Arie must apply for 20 jobs each fornight, but so far it has been to no avail for the young Victorian. The Age report he receives 545 per fortnight from the government, but that is barely enough to survive once rent, bills, food, petrol amd asthma and depression medication are all taken care of. Arie said at least 30 of his friends are also struggling to find work, and his family in Hamilton are suffering financially too. While on youth allowance the government requires its recipients to apply for at least 20 jobs each fortnight. Now, after the hospitality course he was taking part in at TAFE was scrapped when funding was cut, he is considering following in his family's footsteps and getting into security. Arie's grandmother and aunts work in the industry and in six months time he will begin studying a Certificate II in security thanks to a course his employment agency has organised. With 95 percent of the cost taken care of, Arie is positive about the experience and hopes it will help turn his luck around and finally secure him a job. Despite Victoria's youth unemployment rates being at their highest in more than a decade, Tasmania is classified as the worst state for young people to find jobs. Queensland follows not too far behind.

La oración que hemos seleccionado es la siguiente: \\"La belleza de un atardecer refleja la magia que la naturaleza brinda a nuestros sentidos.\\" Esta oración puede ser analizada desde diferentes aspectos. En primer lugar, es importante destacar que el español es una lengua románica que se originó en la región de Castilla, en España. Actualmente, es el segundo idioma más hablado en cuanto a número de hablantes nativos, solo después del chino mandarín. Su influencia es especialmente notable en América Latina y España, pero también se extiende a otras partes del mundo debido a las colonias españolas establecidas a lo largo de la historia. Ahora, centrándonos en la oración en sí, podemos observar que tiene una estructura gramatical clara y un vocabulario variado. La oración está formada por dos proposiciones que se unen a través del verbo \\"refleja\\" en la oración principal y una oración subordinada que comienza con \\"que\\". Ambas proposiciones expresan una idea completa, pero juntas, transmiten un mensaje más profundo sobre la relación entre la belleza del atardecer y el efecto que puede tener en nosotros. El sujeto de la oración es \\"la belleza de un atardecer\\", una construcción verbal que incluye un sustantivo (belleza), un artículo definido (la) y una preposición (de) para establecer una relación entre la belleza y el concepto que la representa, que en este caso es un atardecer. El atardecer es un fenómeno natural y cotidiano que ocurre en el cielo cuando el sol se acerca al horizonte durante la puesta de sol, creando un efecto visual de colores y luces cambiando de intensidad y tonalidades. El verbo \\"refleja\\" en esta oración es una forma conjugada del verbo \\"reflejar\\" en la tercera persona del singular en el presente del indicativo. Esta forma verbal denota una acción que está ocurriendo ahora o una acción habitual. En este caso, el verbo \\"reflejar\\" indica la acción de mostrar o representar algo, siendo la belleza del atardecer un reflejo de la magia que se puede encontrar en la naturaleza. La magia en este contexto no debe entenderse literalmente como algo sobrenatural, sino como una metáfora para describir esos momentos cotidianos y simples pero asombrosos que la naturaleza nos ofrece. La idea se refuerza con el complemento \\"que la naturaleza brinda a nuestros sentidos\\". En esta parte de la oración, \\"la naturaleza\\" es la fuente de esa magia y \\"nuestros sentidos\\" son los receptores o la forma en que percibimos y apreciamos la belleza del atardecer y de otros momentos similares. En resumen, esta oración en español captura el sentimiento poético y nostálgico que puede evocar un atardecer, invitándonos a apreciar no solo su belleza visual sino también el efecto emocional que puede tener en nuestro interior. Al utilizar una gramática y vocabulario precisos, la oración demuestra la riqueza del idioma español y su capacidad para transmitir pensamientos y emociones complejas de una manera clara y evocadora."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many percentage points had Apple's market share decreased by in 2013 from 2012?","response":"Title: Evaluating the Drop in Apple's Market Share in 2013 Introduction The global smartphone market has seen substantial shifts in the last decade with the advent of new companies, products, and consumer preferences. Major players like Apple have constantly competed with rivals like Samsung and newer entrants from China, drastically changing the market dynamics. Apple's market share, in particular, experienced a notable decrease in 2013. This article explores in detail how many percentage points Apple's market share decreased by in 2013 from 2012, along with the factors affecting this decline. A Look at the Numbers: Apple's Market Share in 2012 and 2013 In 2012, Apple's market share peaked at 20.9% in the fourth financial quarter, bolstered by the success of iPhone 5, its then-flagship product. However, the annual global market share for 2012 stood around 18.8%. In comparison, in 2013, Apple's global market share dropped to approximately 15.3%. Consequently, the difference between 2012 and 2013 is 3.5 percentage points. This decline indicates that Apple's grip on the smartphone market was loosening to some extent, particularly as its competitors adapted to consumer demands and orchestrated their growth strategies. Factors Driving the Decline in Apple's Market Share in 2013 1. Increased Competition: One of the primary reasons for Apple's shrinking market share was the increased competition from rivals like Samsung, which in 2013, held a whopping 32% of the global market share. The South Korean manufacturer offered a wide range of devices, from budget to flagship models, catering to diverse consumer segments and tapping into emerging markets. Besides Samsung, Apple also faced competition from successful Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. The rise of these competitors contributed to a more challenging market landscape for Apple in 2013. 2. Slower Adoption Rates: Apple's new product launches, such as the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c, were met with slower adoption rates than earlier models. Market research suggests that the iPhone 5s represented around 10% of the iPhone installed base, while the 5c accounted for roughly 3%. In comparison, the iPhone 5 represented nearly 15% of the installed base following its launch in 2012. This slower adoption rate, coupled with the increasing availability of older iPhone models in the second-hand market, contributed to the decline in Apple's market share. 3. Market Saturation: In 2013, many established markets, like the US and Europe, experienced saturation in smartphone adoption. The majority of potential users had already switched over to smartphones, leading companies like Apple to experience slower growth in these regions. Since Apple's primary market was concentrated in these regions, market saturation played a significant role in constraining growth. 4. Limited Presence in Emerging Markets: During this time, emerging markets like China and India witnessed a surge in the demand for smartphones. However, due to several reasons like import restrictions, pricing, and a preference for lower-cost Android devices, Apple struggled to penetrate these markets effectively. Moreover, the strong presence of other smartphone brands in these regions gave them a greater competitive edge over Apple. Local vendors were often willing to sell devices at lower margins to boost their market share – an approach that Apple rarely followed. Conclusion As evidenced by the numbers, Apple's market share experienced a decline of 3.5 percentage points in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily attributable to factors like increased competition, slower adoption rates, market saturation, and limited presence in emerging markets. While Apple continues to enjoy an unwavering customer loyalty, adapting to changing market requirements and strong competition remains crucial if it wishes to strengthen its position across the global smartphone market landscape."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Rob wants to know more about differences between fish and other non fish creatures in the water. He divided them into two groups, group A and group B. Group A consists of fish, and group B consists of non fish creatures in the water. He started to see the differences between these two groups. Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Answer:","response":"In group B, the eggs would most likely develop inside the mother's body. This is because group B consists of non-fish marine creatures, such as mammals like whales, which give birth to live young after the eggs have developed internally within the mother.

To do this, add 371v to both sides of the equation: 2359v + 371v + 32388 = -371v + 371v - 21813 + 248031 This simplifies to: 2730v + 32388 = 248031 - 21813 Step 2: Simplify the equation. Subtracting 21813 from 248031 we get: 2730v + 32388 = 226218 Step 3: Isolate the variable v on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 32388 from both sides of the equation: 2730v + 32388 - 32388 = 226218 - 32388 This simplifies to: 2730v = 193830 Step 4: Solve for v. To find the value of v, divide both sides of the equation by 2730: 2730v ÷ 2730 = 193830 ÷ 2730 v = 71 So the solution for the given equation, 2359v + 32388 = -371v - 21813 + 248031, is v = 71."},{"question":"A monkey is native to what place that usually has no people?

When the muscle shortens less, it implies that there might be a decrease in muscle contractions involving the stomach and the digestive system. This could indirectly affect the movement and mixing of food in the stomach, which in turn can influence the pancreas' response to chemical changes detected in the stomach. A possible outcome is that the pancreas might produce and release fewer digestive enzymes or do so at a slower rate.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","response":"Based on the review provided, which only contains the text \\"Gd,\\" it is challenging to form a solid opinion or recommendation about the app. The brevity of the review suggests that the user had a generally positive experience, as \\"Gd\\" is commonly interpreted as an abbreviation for \\"good.\\" However, due to the lack of details regarding the user's experience, it is difficult to determine the specific aspects of the app that were appreciated or what features may have contributed to the user's satisfaction. To recommend the app to a friend, more information about its features, performance, and user experience is needed. A longer, more elaborate review would be helpful to understand the app's strengths and weaknesses fully. Detailed reviews typically provide insight into the app's functionality, ease of use, interface, and potential shortcomings. Considering the limitations of the provided review, our recommendation would be placed in the \\"Maybe\\" category. This answer signifies that, while there may be positive aspects to the app, a more comprehensive evaluation is necessary to make a confident recommendation. It would be wise to look for additional reviews to analyze the app further and form an educated opinion. Ideally, encourage your friend to research the app themselves, read more reviews, and examine its features to make their own determination. In conclusion, due to the limited nature of the review, recommending the app merely based on the text \\"Gd\\" is not ideal. A more thorough assessment is needed for a well-rounded, confident recommendation. Until then, we can place the recommendation in the \\"Maybe\\" category, suggesting that it might be suitable, but it's essential to dig deeper into the app's features and performance before making a final decision."},{"question":"Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

So think first.","response":"Sentence B, \\"There is a reflection of the moon in the parking lot,\\" is against common sense. A reflection typically occurs when light bounces off a surface and is visible to an observer. In the case of Sentence A, the moon's light reflects off the lake's surface, which is a smooth and often flat body of water. This reflection is a common natural phenomenon and aligns with common sense. However, Sentence B refers to a reflection in a parking lot, which is typically made of asphalt, concrete, or other solid materials. These surfaces are usually rough and uneven, making it unlikely for the moon's reflection to be visible on them. Given that parking lots are not known for reflecting the moon or other light sources, this sentence goes against common sense."},{"question":"Subsequent negotiations led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino resulted in the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, in part because he requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva. Following a decision by John, the war with Russia ended when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa with Sweden on 10 August 1583. Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod. Whilst these conditions were probably only for the purposes of negotiation, they may have reflected Swedish aspirations of territory in the region.

On an alien planet, a band is playing to a packed audience; keyboardist Octave, guitarist Arpegius, drummer Baryl, and bass player Stella. (\\"One More Time\\"). A military force invades the planet and kidnaps the band (\\"Aerodynamic\\"). A space pilot called Shep is awoken from a dream about Stella by a distress call about the kidnapping, and pursues the kidnappers through a wormhole, where he crashes on Earth (\\"Digital Love\\"). The band are taken to an underground facility, where their memories are removed to disks and their blue skin changed to make them resemble humans. They are fitted with mind-control devices hidden in sunglasses (\\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\"). Their captor, Earl de Darkwood, poses as their manager and presents them as a new band called The Crescendolls, who take the world by storm.(\\"Crescendolls\\"). Meanwhile, Shep finds his way to civilization and discovers what has happened to the band (\\"Nightvision\\").

In the escape, Shep is mortally wounded, and Darkwood's bodyguards are revealed to be androids (\\"Superheroes\\"). Stella is taken to a âGold Record Awardâ ceremony, where the Crescendolls win the Gold Record.

The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

The feeling will come on gradually and may start to spread from your hands and feet up through your arms and legs. If your numbness, prickling, or tingling sensations do not have an obvious cause, such as sitting on your leg for too long or sleeping funny, you should talk to your healthcare provider. If your feet are numb, it can change the way that you walk. Over time, the change can affect your body in other ways, such as causing foot deformities or pain from an uneven gait. You may also get blisters and sores around the affected areas of your feet because you cannot feel that you are walking unevenly. You may experience sharp, jabbing, throbbing, burning, or freezing pain caused from issues within your nerves and not due to an injury. If you’re experiencing pain for no reason, it could be neuropathy. Since your nerves are not responding properly to sensations, you may feel sensations more strongly than you did before. Although this is rare, it could mean that a light pat on the back feels painful to you, or that a hug ignites your pain receptors. If this is caused by neuropathy, it will likely be a recent development and not a lifelong issue with clumsiness. Consider if you’ve been bumping into doors and furniture more often lately, or if you’ve suddenly started to fall down or trip for seemingly no reason. When your motor nerves are affected by the neuropathy, you’ll experience muscle weakness and possibly paralysis because the nerve can’t appropriately communicate with your muscles. In late stages of neuropathy, you may have trouble moving around, picking things up, or even talking. If your autonomic nerves are affected, you may have trouble regulating your bodily functions. This includes telling your body to sweat when you get hot. Your body may not sweat as often, causing you to overheat. Though these symptoms alone could be caused by a variety of problems, if you have them in conjunction with other symptoms like numbness or pain, they may indicate neuropathy. Neuropathy causes nerve damage, so your nerves may not be able to send messages to your body to tell it when to go to the bathroom, when to process food, and when to stop those functions. It’s possible that you may experience the following symptoms: Constipation Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Indigestion Problems urinating Erectile dysfunction in men Lack of vaginal fluid in women If you have neuropathy, your body may be unable to regulate your heart rate and blood pressure, so it won’t be able to respond to changes in your activity levels. Your heart rate may remain high even when you are not exercising, and your blood pressure can quickly drop, causing you to feel dizzy. If you have dizziness or lightheadedness along with pain or tingling, it could be neuropathy. The dizziness and lightheadedness may be worse when you sit down or stand up. Summary:","response":"If you start feeling numbness, prickling, or tingling in your hands and feet without any obvious reason, and it causes you pain, trouble walking, or issues with body functions, it might be neuropathy, which is a problem with your nerves."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation and you have to find its answer.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more babies will be born happens, how will it affect LESS babies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"To answer this question, we need to analyze the perturbation hypothesis and examine whether an increase in the number of babies born will have a direct or indirect effect on the process, leading to fewer babies being born. Step 1: Understanding the perturbation hypothesis The hypothesis states that if more babies are born, it will somehow lead to fewer babies. We have to analyze this statement in the context of the given process and identify possible reasons or outcomes that might support this claim. Step 2: Analyzing the process We have a general outline of the human life cycle: 1. Humans are born 2. Babies become infants 3. Infants become children 4. Children learn skills 5. Children become teenagers 6. Teenagers undergo puberty 7. Teenagers become adults 8. Adults have children 9. Adults become elderly 10. Elderly humans die Step 3: Evaluating the hypothesis If more babies are born, there might be several consequences that could potentially lead to fewer babies being born in the future: 1. Overpopulation, resulting in limited resources, could drive societies to implement policies discouraging or regulating childbirth, eventually leading to fewer babies being born. 2. An increase in the population of children and teenagers might place pressure on education systems and other support structures, resulting in people delaying having children or having fewer children. 3. An increased awareness of the environmental impact of overpopulation might lead to a cultural shift where having fewer children becomes the norm. 4. Economic consequences of a higher birth rate might result in delayed parenthood due to financial concerns, leading people to have fewer children in total. So, the perturbation hypothesis does have potential indirect effects on the process. An increase in the number of babies being born can lead to societal, economic, and environmental factors that might eventually contribute to fewer babies being born in the future. However, these consequences are not guaranteed, and other factors may mitigate or intensify the impact of the perturbation."},{"question":"Based on the sentence \\"Two dark-haired men in orange shirts leaning on a desk next to a man in a uniform.\\", is the sentence \\"The three men are at the baseball field.\\" a true sentence?","response":"Based on the given description, the sentence \\"The three men are at the baseball field.\\" cannot be conclusively identified as either true or false strictly from the information given. The first sentence provides a detailed visual description of three men - two dark-haired men in orange shirts who are leaning on desk alongside one who is in a uniform. Nonetheless, it does not specify the exact location where these men are situated. We know they're near a desk, but we don't know whether this desk is located in an office, a library, a school, or indeed, a baseball field. The second sentence, on the other hand, asserts that the three men are at a baseball field. There's a possibility that this could be true: for instance, the man in uniform could potentially be a baseball coach or player, and the men in orange shirts might be fans or part of a support crew for a team wearing orange. Equally, the desk could theoretically be a scoring desk or a commentator’s desk for the game. Likewise, there are many other scenarios where this setup could be plausible. However, this is all speculative. Without additional information bridging the two sentences and specifying that the men near the desk are in fact at a baseball field, we cannot definitively say whether the second sentence is true or false based purely on the information provided in the first sentence. Merely from the first sentence it is not certain whether these men are at a baseball field or not.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who makes several conflicting statements? Movie plot title: Dial M for Murder Movie plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money. To please his wife, he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment. Margot once had a relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), an American crime scriptwriter, but broke it off when he went back to the U.S. for a year.In time they stopped writing to each other, and when Mark returns to London she tells him that she burned all his letters but one. Margo explains to Mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded £50, so Margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as intended, but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned. Mark tells Margo that he wants to tell Tony about them so she can divorce Tony so she and Mark can be together, but Margot refuses out of fear of hurting Tony's feelings.It is also revealed that Tony and Margot have made their wills, naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling £90,000. For a year, Tony meticulously plans Margot's murder. She has no idea that Tony knows of her love for Mark. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of Mark's letters, and even assumed the role of the anonymous Brixton-based blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back. (She did, but he asked for only £50 and she did not, of course, get the letter back.) He even watched them having a little farewell party, eating spaghetti with mushrooms in Mark's studio flat in Chelsea.Tony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year, collecting £1,000 in (used) one-pound (£1) notes, with which he plans to pay a contract killer. He singles out the perfect man to do the job: Charles Alexander \\"C.A.\\" Swann (Anthony Dawson), who now calls himself \\"Captain Lesgate\\", a former acquaintance who has embarked on a life of petty crime since even before leaving Cambridge where he and Tony were both students.

Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Dial M for Murder,\\" the character who makes several conflicting statements is Tony Wendice (Ray Milland). Tony is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money and now sells sports equipment. Throughout the plot, Tony exhibits manipulative and deceitful behavior to carry out his calculated plan to murder Margot. He demonstrates his cunningness by creating multiple false narratives and conflicting statements to cover up his true intentions. For instance, he poses as an anonymous blackmailer to find out if Margot would pay to get Mark's letter back. Despite asking for £50, he never returns the letter to her. Another example of Tony's conflicting statements is when he tricks Charles Alexander \\"C.A.\\" Swann (Anthony Dawson) into a murder-for-hire plot with the intent of killing Margot. Tony uses his knowledge of Swann's criminal past to blackmail him into participating in the plan. Furthermore, Tony is very secretive and hides his true motives from his wife, Margot. She is entirely unaware of his knowledge of her past relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) and Tony's year-long plot to plan her murder. He is successful in maintaining an innocent facade, making conflicting statements when necessary, and skillfully manipulates people around him to execute his plans. In conclusion, the character who makes several conflicting statements in \\"Dial M for Murder\\" is Tony Wendice. He demonstrates deceitful and manipulative behavior to orchestrate the perfect murder plan against Margot for his personal gain."},{"question":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Hogwash Review: This book is fundamentalist hogwash.

Article: Morocco, a North African kingdom, is on the south of the Mediterranean Sea and on the east of the Atlantic Ocean, between Algeria and Western Sahara. Morocco became independent from France in 1956. People in Morocco speak Arabic, which is the official language. Some people speak French and Spanish. 98.7% of the people believe in Islam. The capital city of Morocco is Rabat. Casablanca, in the north of this country, is the largest city. The famous movie Casablanca tells a story which happened in this city. It seldom rains in Morocco. The coastal cities are not cold in winter (around 16degC) and not hot in summer (around 22degC). In the inland areas, winters are colder and summers warmer. High up in the mountains the temperature can be as cold as -17.8degCin winter, and mountain tops are covered with snow most of the year. The population of Morocco is about 31,000,000. Most children in Morocco go to primary school, but only about 39% of them go to secondary school. However, this country has one of the oldest universities in the world, hundreds of years older than Oxford University. It is Al Qarawiyin University in Northern Morocco, which was founded in AD 859.

It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant. Richard O' Sullivan literally gets 'Randi'(sic).

So far, we know that there were at least two creditors who divided their collective share of 125. We don't have the information regarding the total amount to be distributed among creditors or the individual percentages or shares each creditor is entitled to receive. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the creditors are not allocating their shares correctly based solely on the information provided. To determine whether the allocation of shares is correct or not, we will need the following additional information: 1. The total amount of debt to be allocated among creditors: This is the sum of the principal amount and any interest, legal costs, or other charges. Knowing the total amount of debt to be distributed will help us gauge if the 125 allocated to the first two creditors is proportionally correct, given their respective shares. 2. The individual shares or percentages of the creditors: The proportion of the total debt that each creditor is entitled to will help us determine if the 125 allocated to the first two creditors is accurate. We will need to know the exact percentages or proportions allocated to each creditor based on their claims. 3. The actual allocation procedure: It is essential to know the agreed-upon order, priority, or process of sharing debts among the creditors. This might include the priority of statutory or secured creditors, the order of distributing funds to different creditors, and any agreements or legally binding rulings regarding the allocation to specific creditors. Once we have the information mentioned above, we can analyze the allocation of the 125 share to the first two creditors and determine if they allocated their shares correctly or not. If there is a discrepancy in the allocated amounts or the procedure is not followed, we can conclude that the creditors are not allocating their shares correctly. However, without this additional information, it is not possible to make a firm conclusion based on the limited facts presented."},{"question":"Background: DiBiase was born in Miami, Florida. He is the biological son of wrestler Helen Nevins and Ted Wills, an entertainer and singer. He is the adopted son of wrestler \\"Iron\\" Mike DiBiase, who was Italian-American. DiBiase is of mostly German and English ancestry. Context: DiBiase also spent time in the Georgia area where he had an early face run. One legendary angle had DiBiase enduring four piledrivers (one on the concrete floor and three in the ring) administered in the WTBS studio arena by The Fabulous Freebirds before his tag team partner, Tommy \\"Wildfire\\" Rich, threw in the towel (the angle of DiBiase being badly injured was so real the TBS studio audience could be seen crying). Rich and DiBiase later feuded, leading to a loser leaves town match which DiBiase won, but instead of Rich leaving the area, he donned a mask calling himself \\"Mister R.\\" The feud culminated in a match between Mister R and DiBiase, Rich appeared from backstage and distracted DiBiase. Mister R then rolled up DiBiase to get the win and unmasked as Brad Armstrong. Both DiBiase and Rich left the territory shortly thereafter. In the early to mid-1980s, DiBiase participated in angles in various territories feuding with the likes of Ric Flair best known from this point in his Mid South return with the likes of Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, Dick Murdoch, The Fabulous Freebirds and One Man Gang. DiBiase turned heel against the Junkyard Dog and formed a group called The Rat Pack with Jim Duggan and Matt Borne, ran Mid-south for months. Aligning with Skandor Akbar, Dibiase caused a riff with the group, namely Duggan. The two would feud until DiBiase lost a loser leave town match. He also held various championships and made frequent trips to All Japan Pro Wrestling until his eventual departure from Mid-South Wrestling (which by this point was now the UWF). Typically, his matches ended with the use of a \\"loaded\\" black glove, which he pulled from his tights to \\"knock out\\" his opponent when the referee was not looking. While locked in talks with the National Wrestling Alliance in 1987 after the UWF was acquired by Jim Crockett, DiBiase received an offer from the WWF. DiBiase was eventually convinced by WWF to sign up despite the fact that he would not be told his gimmick until after he agreed, under the promise that it was something that would receive a serious push. WWF official Pat Patterson informed DiBiase that if owner Vince McMahon were to go out to wrestle, it would be the gimmick that he would give himself. Question: Did he get any recognition?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, Ted DiBiase, also known as \\"The Million Dollar Man,\\" received significant recognition throughout his wrestling career.

He was well-known for his various feuds and alliances, as well as his participation in numerous wrestling promotions, including the WWF (now WWE), NWA, and All Japan Pro Wrestling. DiBiase's unique wrestling persona, earned him significant recognition and accolades. Vince McMahon's decision to give DiBiase the \\"Million Dollar Man\\" gimmick reflected the confidence the WWF had in his abilities, and it quickly became one of the most iconic personas in wrestling history. As the Million Dollar Man, DiBiase flaunted his wealth and used money to control and influence others, both in and out of the ring. Throughout his career, DiBiase amassed an impressive list of accomplishments, including multiple championship titles in various wrestling promotions. In WWF, he held the WWF World Tag Team Championship three times with Irwin R. Schyster as his partner. He was also the winner of the WWF King of the Ring Tournament in 1988 and the WWF North American Heavyweight Champion.

Article: One reaction to all the concern about tropical deforestation is a blank stare that asks the question, \\"Since I don't live there, what does it have to do with me?\\" The answer is that your way of life, wherever you live in the world, is tied to the tropics in many ways. If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives?

Answer:","response":"The specialism of 19th-century academic art that is being referred to is \\"Naturalism.\\" Naturalism in art refers to the depiction of realistic objects in a natural setting. It emphasizes detailed, accurate representations of the visible world, portraying everyday subjects and scenes without idealization or stylization. This artistic movement was prominent during the 19th century, specifically in Europe, and was greatly influenced by the works of artists such as Jean-François Millet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. One notable academic who was particularly interested in Naturalism and its teachings was Emile Zola (1840-1902). Zola was a French novelist, critic, and political activist, who was a significant figure not only in the Naturalist art movement but also in naturalist literature. Although he was not an artist, he strongly defended the works of Naturalist painters and their art, and he wrote extensively about the movement in his columns, articles, and books. Zola advocated for the Naturalist movement in both literature and painting, asserting that works of art should portray life as it truly is, without romanticism or embellishment. Emile Zola was not primarily a teacher or professor at a university, but his influence on the Naturalism movement in art and literature was immense. Hence, while he did not hold a teaching position at a specific university, his writings and ideas significantly contributed to shaping the teachings around Naturalist art during the 19th century. Art teachers and universities that specialized in academic art would ultimately incorporate Zola's ideas and approaches to Naturalism into their curricula, as his writings served as a valuable resource for understanding the motivations and techniques of the movement. It is crucial to point out, however, that there were several art academies and universities where naturalism was taught and appreciated during the 19th century. Notable among them were the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Both institutions provided a formal art education for their students and would have likely incorporated the study of Naturalism as part of their curriculum due to its prominence within the academic art world during the period."},{"question":"It will affect us directly, and when communicated properly should have positive results.\\" Translate to French.","response":"\\"Cela nous affectera directement, et lorsqu'il sera correctement communiqué, cela devrait avoir des résultats positifs.\\" Cette phrase, traduite en français, exprime l'idée que l'action, l'événement ou la situation mentionnée aura un impact immédiat et direct sur nous.

Simplify both sides of the equation: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have two terms containing h (227*h and 20*h): 227*h + 20*h = 247*h The left side of the equation now becomes: 247*h + 4913 On the right side, subtract 2475 from 1213: 1213 - 2475 = -1262 Now, we have the equation: 247*h + 4913 = -1262 2. Isolate the variable h: To do this, we need to remove the constant term from the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4913 from both sides of the equation: 247*h + 4913 - 4913 = -1262 - 4913 Now, the equation becomes: 247*h = -6175 3. Solve for h: We now have a simple equation with a single term containing the variable h. To solve for h, we need to get h alone on the left side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 247: 247*h / 247 = -6175 / 247 Now, the equation becomes: h = -25 So, the answer to the given math problem is: h = -25"},{"question":"Math Problem Solve 5*t - 22 = -12 for t.","response":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

This is what it will look like: 5 * t - 22 + 22 = -12 + 22 Since -22 + 22 is 0, we now have: 5 * t = 10 Now we need to find the value of 't' by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: 5 * t / 5 = 10 / 5 Since 5 / 5 is 1, we get: t = 2 So the value of 't' that solves this math problem is 2.

In conclusion, the answer to the question is \\"Tae Bo.\\""},{"question":"Background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Paragraph: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","response":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored. This means that the concentration of products increases and the concentration of reactants decreases. In case B, the reverse reaction is favored, which leads to an increase in the concentration of reactants and a decrease in the concentration of products. Therefore, the reactants concentration would be lower in case A than in case B."},{"question":"Process: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake. Question: suppose less cracks develop beneath the surface happens, how will it affect less stronger earthquakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"less effect. Explanation: Step-by-step thinking process: 1. Less cracks develop beneath the surface: If fewer cracks develop deep beneath the earth's surface, the amount of available space for the earth's crust to move and interact is reduced. 2. The cracks get very long and big in some places: With fewer cracks, the extent of long and big cracks will be limited, causing less movement and friction between rocks on both sides of the cracks. 3. The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks: As there are fewer cracks and less movement overall, the pressure exerted on the rocks will be reduced. 4. The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard: With less pressure being applied, the force with which rocks press against each other will be less intense. This means less potential for significant stress build-ups that would cause stronger earthquakes. 5. The cracks continue to develop: The development of cracks is limited in this scenario, so they may not develop as extensively, resulting in less interaction between the earth's crust along these cracks. 6. The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks: With less interaction between the earth's crust along the cracks, there will be less movement overall, reducing the likelihood of stronger earthquakes. 7. The pressure and movement around the cracks cause the rocks to crumble in some places: Since pressure and movement are less intense, there will be less crumbling of rocks. 8. A lot of energy is released: With less intense pressure and movement, the amount of energy released will be reduced, leading to potentially weaker earthquakes. 9. The energy causes seismic waves: With less energy being released, the seismic waves generated will likely be less intense. 10. The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake: As the seismic waves will be less intense, the resulting earthquakes will be weaker. To summarize, fewer cracks developing beneath the surface will lead to less pressure, less movement, less energy release, and ultimately less intense seismic waves. This will result in less severe earthquake events, or directly influence the second effect mentioned, i.e., the cracks getting very long and big in some places, by having a lessened effect on it."},{"question":"Q:Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass.

(1). of people are cheering and clapping as a person leads with a blue cape - This does not necessarily link with the stunts described. (3). gather to cheer about the show as the crowd shakes hands with some officials - This seems a bit off-topic as it introduces unrelated elements (officials). (4). move down to the next level and mates watch over the things doing tricks and fighting - This is unclear and doesn't include the audience's reaction to the stunts.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations.

Callahan Answer:","response":"Title: The Reckoning of Scorpio Genre: Action, Mystery-Thriller Plot: The story begins in the cold, bustling city of Riverside, where crime rates have soared, and the citizens have lost their faith in law enforcement. The mysterious and elusive criminal mastermind, Scorpio, played by a charismatic and ruthless actor, has been orchestrating a series of high-profile crimes throughout the city. Known for his brutal and calculated methods, Scorpio enjoys taunting law enforcement and the public by leaving cryptic messages and clues at each crime scene. Due to the police's inability to apprehend Scorpio, many innocent lives have been threatened by the chaos that envelops Riverside City daily. Fed up with the incompetence of the local law enforcement, the city's mayor enlists the help of detective Callahan, played by an intense and passionate actor. Callahan, a former officer with a mysterious past, is known for his unconventional crime-solving methods. He is incredibly determined to bring Scorpio to justice, regardless of the risks that may entail. As Callahan starts to investigate Scorpio's past crimes, he begins to notice a pattern within the criminal's modus operandi. Each offense seems to involve the brutal torture of the innocent, as well as extracting information to plot the next heinous and spiteful crime. Callahan grows increasingly obsessed with trying to understand Scorpio's twisted mind, as this case holds personal significance for him. As the investigation progresses, we learn through a series of flashbacks that during Callahan's time as an undercover cop, his life was ruined when his family was brutally murdered after his identity was leaked to the criminal underworld. Scorpio had played a major part in this betrayal, leading to the death of Callahan's family, which fueled Callahan's relentless pursuit of justice. Throughout the movie, Scorpio and Callahan engage in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, both always narrowly evading the other. As the tension mounts, we see Callahan inching closer to Scorpio's inner circle, eventually figuring out the location of Scorpio's secret hideout. However, the criminal mastermind grows increasingly aware of Callahan's pursuit and sets a trap to catch him. In the heated climax of the film, Callahan manages to find Scorpio amidst the criminal's dark lair just as Scorpio's sinister henchmen find and surround him. The two engage in an intense combat sequence, with Callahan allowing himself to become gravely injured in order to get close to Scorpio. Callahan reveals the emotional turmoil that Scorpio's actions have caused him and finally gets the upper hand in the fight. In an ironic act of street justice, Callahan stabs Scorpio in the leg, echoing the pain and suffering Scorpio has inflicted on his innocent victims. Despite his injury, Scorpio is apprehended and brought into police custody, finally restoring a semblance of order to the beleaguered city of Riverside. The movie ends with Callahan reflecting on whether the pursuit of vengeance was truly worth the endless pain he endured and the danger he subject himself to while questioning if justice was served or if it might require a different path. The Reckoning of Scorpio is a tale of obsession and revenge. It dives deep into the personal battles between the protagonist and antagonist, always maintaining a high level of tension and intrigue, ultimately bringing to light the blurred lines between right and wrong."},{"question":"Trivia question: Rickets is caused by a deficiency in which vitamin?

He claimed that four Ukrainian soldiers were killed , while two of his men were wounded during the battles . He claimed that four Ukrainian soldiers were killed , while two of his men were wounded during the fighting .","response":"The two sentences convey a similar meaning, but there is a subtle difference in the choice of words used to describe the event that took place. Both sentences indicate a claim made by someone concerning the casualties of an incident involving Ukrainian soldiers and his own men. In the first sentence, the term \\"battles\\" is used, while in the second sentence, \\"fighting\\" is utilized. Although these words might seem interchangeable, they convey slightly different nuances when describing the nature of the conflict. A \\"battle\\" typically refers to a specific engagement between armed forces, either between two or more parties, in a war or military context. It is generally a structured and planned encounter with a clear objective, and involves the use of strategy and tactics. Examples of famous historical battles include the Battle of Waterloo, the Battle of Gettysburg, and the Battle of Hastings. On the other hand, \\"fighting\\" may encompass various forms of conflict, ranging from spontaneous skirmishes to more organized campaigns. This term can be used in a general sense to describe any kind of physical or verbal confrontation between people or groups. It may not necessarily bear the strategic or planned characteristics that a \\"battle\\" possesses. Additionally, \\"fighting\\" often implies ongoing conflict, rather than a single engagement. In summary, while both sentences essentially convey the same idea, the use of \\"battles\\" in the first sentence may suggest that the casualties occurred during specific and planned engagements, whereas the use of \\"fighting\\" in the second sentence could imply that the casualties were a result of ongoing, and possibly sporadic, confrontations.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time.

But when the cast of “Forever Tango’’ took their bows on opening night at the Cutler Majestic Theatre, they remained as formal as they had been all evening, with few if any traces of smiles evident on their faces. That intensity was in keeping with the show they’d just performed, and with the tradition of the Argentine tango. Though it celebrates the power of fiery, heedless passion, “Forever Tango’’ is suffused throughout with an aura of focused professionalism and absolute concentration. That adds up to a display of proficiency without much personality in the show’s first half, when the performers make scant effort to draw in the audience. But after intermission “Forever Tango’’ turns into something special: its routines more challenging; the dancers’ movements still precisely controlled but also more fluid, dynamic, and communicative; their intertwined limbs virtually melding two bodies into one as they sweep across the stage. Conceived by Luis Bravo long before “Dancing With the Stars’’ was so much as a gleam in a network programmer’s eye, “Forever Tango’’ has proven durably popular, ending its most recent Broadway run in September. Bravo is at the helm for the touring production that will be in Boston through Saturday, and he’s also in the orchestra, playing the cello. Cutler Majestic Theatre, 617-824-8000. http://www.cutlermajestic.org Six male-female duos perform more than a dozen tango routines in “Forever Tango,’’ attired in a shimmering array of elegant dresses and suits created by costume designer Argemira Affonso. The dances are punctuated by evocative instrumental numbers performed by the fine orchestra, assembled onstage. Pianist Jorge Vernieri proved to be a particular crowd favorite on opening night. Less effective was vocalist Noemi Marcela, whose singing was often nearly drowned out by the orchestra. The dancers choreographed the tango routines themselves, and they perform them with disciplined technique and plenty of dazzling footwork. Their physical vocabulary relies on rapidly crossed ankles and scissoring legs and languidly stretched-out arms; on spins, twirls, and sudden kicks; on stomping and striding, slow-motion swoons and swift-paced back-and-forths. In one visually striking scene, when Aldana Silveyra and Diego Ortega were entwined, Silveyra allowed her long hair to cling to his head. While Bravo likes to describe the tango as “a story you tell in three minutes,’’ the truth is that “Forever Tango’’ would benefit from more variety in the stories it tells. There is a fundamental sameness to the emotional arc of a number of the tangos, which are enacted with fixed, urgent expressions that suggest everything is riding on this dance, or at least one particular thing, impossible to mistake. (After one smoldering duet, my companion remarked, “They need to get a room.’’) In Act 1, “El Suburbio’’ attempts a larger narrative than straightforward romance and seduction, presenting a scene in a brothel that features suggestively clad women and pinstriped, fedora-wearing tough guys. But a potentially intriguing power struggle dissolves into a farrago of clichés that ultimately generates less tension than the fight scenes Jerome Robbins choreographed for “West Side Story.’’ Act 2 gets off to a strong start with “Tanguera,’’ a duet performed by Soledad Buss and César Peral, and electricity steadily courses through “Forever Tango’’ from that point on. Ariel Manzanares and Natalia Turelli bring some welcome comic relief throughout the show. In one sequence, Manzanares keeps attempting to take pictures of the orchestra with a clunky, old-fashioned camera; later, he parodies the melodramatic seething of the tango dancers. Turelli clings to his back, allowing herself to be dragged as he walks across the stage, and when she tries to steal just a bit of the spotlight by making grand gestures, he quickly returns her hand to his shoulder. In “Quejas de Bandoneón,” Sebastián Ripoll and Mariana Bojanich succeed in creating a pair of distinct personalities while also generating an air of mystery tantalizing enough that you’re left wondering what kind of future awaits these lovers once the dance is over. At the end of “Forever Tango,’’ after the cast took their bows, they delivered one final display of their impressive dance skills. They still weren’t smiling, but by that time the audience was. Summary:","response":"\\"Forever Tango\\" is a serious and intense show about the Argentine tango. It's kind of like a story you tell with dancing. It was put together by Luis Bravo who also plays musical instruments during the show. The show first starts off with the dancers being very focused and they do not interact much with the audience. But after a short break, the dancing starts to get really fun and the dancers even make their bodies move together as if they were one. The show is really popular and has been performed many times in lots of places. The dances are done by six pairs of dancers who wear beautiful dresses and suits. They perform lots of different tango moves, all with their own special flair. The dancers even make up their own tango routines which requires a lot of skills and flashy steps. Some parts of the show are more exciting than others, for instance, the second part of the show starts off really strong, and there are also funny parts when one of the dancers tries to take pictures while the other dances. However, some parts of the show could use a bit more variety as they tend to tell the same kind of story. In one scene, a woman lets her long hair stick to her dancing partner's head which was really striking to see! By the end of the show, even though the dancers weren't smiling, the audience really enjoyed it and were smiling a lot. After the show ended, the dancers also showed off some more of their wonderful dancing skills."},{"question":"Explain simply why yes is the correct answer to: Premise: \\"A skateboarder jumping in front of a building.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Someone performs skateboarding tricks outside.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

They are attracted to each other, and bond as if they had known each other for a long time. They marry and have two children, Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie (Jessica Brooks Grant). Their idyllic life ends when the children die in a car crash. Life becomes difficult: Annie suffers a mental breakdown and the couple contemplates divorce, but they manage through their losses.

He sees Annie's attempts to cope with his loss and attempts to communicate with her, despite advice from a presence that this will only cause her more pain. When his attempts cause more sorrow, he decides to move on. Chris awakens in Heaven, and learns that his immediate surroundings can be controlled by his imagination. He meets a man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) he recognizes as Albert, his friend and mentor from his medical residency, and the presence from his time as a \\"ghost\\" on Earth.

Choices: 1). eat a good sized meal. 2). take a nap for an hour.","response":"To fix hunger, the appropriate choice would be option 1: eat a good sized meal. Justification for choosing option 1: Hunger is a biological response from our body that indicates it needs food as an energy source to continue performing its functions.

This will effectively satisfy our hunger and provide energy for our daily activities. Why option 2 is not ideal: Taking a nap for an hour (option 2) helps in resting our body and mind but does not address the fundamental cause of hunger, which is the need for nutrients and energy derived from food. A nap might temporarily distract from the sensation of hunger, but it will not resolve it or provide the essential nourishment required by the body."},{"question":"Q: Question: what is a melon baller used for?

While it's primarily used for melons like cantaloupe and watermelons, it can also be used on any soft fruit or vegetable, for example, papaya, mango, or even butter or ice cream for small, round shapes. The major application of a melon baller is to create ornamental pieces for food presentation, since the scooped out round balls of fruit or vegetable are visually attractive. These scooped pieces can be used for various purposes such as garnishing, in cocktails, or as part of a dessert. Saying \\"They are generally used in fruit salad\\" would be a reasonable answer, but it is not the only use for a melon baller. It can also be used to hollow out vegetables for stuffing, to core apples or pears, or to make uniform balls of dough for cookies or other baked goods.

Salon - A salon offers beauty and hair treatments, but it's not a place you would typically find a bar. Therefore, it's unlikely that James's sister lives here. 3. Michigan - Michigan is a state in the United States, so James's sister could very well live there. However, this option doesn't give any indication of where James might find a bar. 4. Nightclub - Nightclubs usually have bars, but it's not a place where someone lives. James wouldn't find his sister living in a nightclub. 5. Public house - A public house, also known as a pub, is known for serving alcoholic beverages, and it's common for people to socialize in such places. There is a possibility that James's sister lives near a public house and that's why he is looking for a bar. Based on the given options, the most plausible answer is that James's sister lives near an \\"airport.\\" When James flew to see his sister, he might be waiting for her to pick him up or pass time during a layover, and the first thing he looked for was a bar, which could be situated within the airport premises."},{"question":"Appleton, Wisconsin, isPartOf, Grand Chute, Wisconsin What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","response":"Appleton, Wisconsin, is an integral part of the larger community of Grand Chute, Wisconsin, thus contributing to its development and regional significance."},{"question":"Diese können in den Archiven der debian-vote-Mailingliste gefunden werden.

To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. Which experiment would be less appropriate for case C, case A or case B? Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. A:","response":"Case B, which involved charging by induction, would be less appropriate for case C (charging the phone remotely). Charging by induction does not require direct contact between the objects, which would better suit a remote charging scenario, while charging by conduction requires the objects to touch each other, making it less suitable for remote charging."},{"question":"That is the question exercising France's football scribblers. And most think he is finished. Once upon a time it would have been all about an injury, or a sudden loss of form, or some tragic personal circumstance. But this is French Football 2015. The issue is rather more sordid. Incredible though it sounds, it is whether Karim Benzema helped blackmail a fellow French national team-mate over a sexual escapade caught on phone-cam. The Real Madrid forward has denied wrongdoing, telling police he merely advised Mathieu Valbuena about what to do in a difficult situation. But investigators believe it is more serious than that, and Karim Benzema faces possible charges of \\"complicity in a blackmail attempt\\". More damagingly, phone transcripts have now been leaked to the press which cast heavy doubt on the official Benzema version. All in all, the affair has plunged French football into another grave crisis - just as it was emerging from the debacle of South Africa 2010. That was when the team went on strike during training, and were knocked out of the World Cup in disgrace. Once again popular anger is being turned on players apparently more interested in money and disreputable friendships than in loyalty to the flag. And once again, the team's chances on the field look like being gravely compromised. The story began earlier this year when the Olympique Lyonnais and France midfielder Mathieu Valbuena learned that a sex video featuring himself and a woman had been purloined from his mobile phone. The person responsible was allegedly Axel Angot, described in the French press as a kind of Mr Fixit for super-rich footballers. He and two others, named as Mustapha Z. and Younes H., allegedly tried to extort unspecified favours from Valbuena. Benzema faces charges Benzema and Valbuena left out of French squad Benitez offers Benzema 'total support' However Mathieu Valbuena refused to play ball and went to the police, who placed the three suspects under phone taps. At this point, it is alleged the three tried another tactic. Karim Zenati was approached - an old mucker of Karim Benzema's and a man with convictions for armed theft and drug dealing. He agreed to use his friendship with the Real Madrid star to try to get the message through to Mathieu Valbuena. And that is how - during training at the national side's camp at Clairefontaine on 5 October - the two footballers had the conversation which is key to the case against Karim Benzema. The transcripts leaked by police to Europe 1 radio are of a phone call carried out on October 6 between Karim Benzema and Karim Zenati. In it the player describes what happened when he spoke to Mathieu Valbuena the day before. Initially, he says, Mathieu Valbuena did not take him seriously. But Karim Benzema goes on: \\"I said to him: 'I'm going to sort it out for you. You got to go see the guy. He'll come. He'll talk to you. I give you my word there's no other copy.'\\" Later Karim Benzema tells Karim Zenati: \\"I said (to Valbuena): 'If you want the video to be destroyed, my friend comes up to see you in Lyon and you sort it out face to face with him.'\\" At one point Karim Benzema describes how Mathieu Valbuena asked him if his \\"tattoos\\" are visible in the video. \\"I told him 'you can see everything'.\\" But he later admits to Karim Zenati he has not actually seen the video. The reference to tattoos is unclear. It could be that they are on an intimate part of the body, or that Mathieu Valbuena fears they clearly identify him in the sex-tape. Karim Benzema goes on: \\"I said (to Valbuena): 'My role stops here. Now it's my friend who takes over. He's the one who knows the person with the video. Me, I don't know him. So now if you want to sort this out, give me your number. I'll pass it on and you sort it out with him.'\\" According to Europe 1, the tone of the conversation between Benzema and Zenati suggests for them it is all a hilarious prank. The law will have to decide whether this amounts to evidence of complicity to blackmail. Karim Benzema's brief has already cried foul, saying the leak was \\"selective\\" and left out parts that might exculpate his client. The defence team will no doubt point out that no actual demand was ever mentioned in the conversation; and there will also be argument over whether passing on a blackmail message constitutes providing help. But the immediate question is where this leaves Karim Benzema - and Mathieu Valbuena - in relation to the national squad. And here, there are grave doubts indeed. \\"I find it hard to see how Benzema can make it to Euro 2016,\\" says Vincent Deluc of L'Equipe newspaper. He says that though national coach Didier Deschamps has publicly stuck by his striker - saying he is innocent until proven otherwise - the Real Madrid player's plummeting reputation will prove too much. The case risks dragging on for months or even years, and since South Africa the French football authorities are committed to building up a cleaner image for the game. Karim Benzema is already connected to a previous squalid affair, in which footballers had sex with an under-age call-girl. He was found innocent after successfully arguing he could not have known her age. \\"And I am afraid Valbuena will be collateral damage,\\" continues Deluc. \\"Can you imagine if Deschamps excludes Benzema but keeps Valbuena? \\"The atmosphere in the dressing-room will be appalling - with some of the players blaming Valbuena for the exclusion of their top scorer. Totally unfair on Valbuena, who's an innocent party in all this, but that's the reality.\\" Adding to the difficulty is that under the terms of Karim Benzema's bail, he is not allowed contact with any of the others involved in the affair - including Mathieu Valbuena. So - quite apart from the already tense relationship between the men - training together is out. For Bruno Roger-Petit of Le Figaro, \\"Deschamps will have no choice but to deselect Benzema. Any other arrangement will condemn him in the eyes of public opinion... Whatever happens, Benzema on the national side - it's over.\\" \\"It's going to be a huge blow,\\" says Darren Tulett, football anchor at BeinSport TV, \\"because Benzema is Deschamps's number one striker. He is France's Wayne Rooney.\\" \\"Together with Valbuena, they've been France's goal-scoring combo for the last couple of years.\\" Neither player has been chosen for the upcoming friendlies against Germany and England. Benzema is injured. But even if he was not, it is hard to see how in current circumstances Deschamps could pick him. For next Tuesday's match at Wembley, there is an interesting - and relevant - fact. The last friendly played there between England and France was in November 2010. France won 2-1. England's goal came from Crouch. France's scorers? Benzema and Valbuena. What is a summary of this text?","response":"Alright kiddo! So, imagine you and your best friend Bob have a secret handshake.

A player named Karim Benzema is in trouble because he may have helped in a similar situation, but he denies it. This has caused lots of problems for the French football team."},{"question":"After making a mess in the kitchen she came to the clear understanding that they were out of coffee , only making her crankier .

A:","response":"\\"Leak\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it directly relates to the situation described in the question. When the ceiling is \\"soggy,\\" it implies that it is damp or wet, indicating a possible presence of moisture or water. In buildings, a common reason for a wet ceiling is a leak in the roof, allowing water to seep inside and cause damage to the ceiling materials. The other possible answers don't relate to the situation in an intuitive or logical way: 1. Building - While the scenario does involve a building (due to the mention of a ceiling), this option doesn't address the issue of the soggy ceiling and its cause. 2. Field - This word is not directly related to any aspect of the question about a soggy ceiling, making it an irrelevant choice. 3. Metaphor - A metaphor is a figure of speech used to represent one thing by comparing it to another. It has no direct connection to the physical condition of a wet ceiling. 4. Sag - While a sagging ceiling can occur due to continued water damage, it does not provide a direct cause for the wetness in the ceiling. A leaking roof, on the other hand, does serve as a direct cause.

It's an important automobile in the history of the company as it marked the beginning of a partnership and brand that would go on to produce some of the most luxurious and iconic cars the world has ever seen. The Rolls-Royce 10 hp was introduced in 1904 at the Paris Salon. The car was developed as a collaboration between Charles Stewart Rolls, an owner of a high-end car dealership, and Frederick Henry Royce, a skilled engineer who had recently started producing his own cars. Their partnership led to the formation of Rolls-Royce Limited, which aimed to manufacture luxury vehicles with a focus on exquisite craftsmanship and superior performance. The 10 hp was powered by a two-cylinder engine that offered 12 horsepower, and it was equipped with a three-speed manual transmission. Although its top speed was only 39 miles per hour, it was regarded as a very reliable and well-engineered machine for its time. The 10 hp featured a distinctive rectangular radiator grille, a design aspect that has become a hallmark of Rolls-Royce cars over the years. Only 17 units of the Rolls-Royce 10 hp were made, and the car was in production from 1904 to 1906. Due to its limited production run, the 10 hp is an extremely rare and valuable vehicle today. In fact, one was sold at auction in 2007 for an impressive £3.5 million. The Rolls-Royce 10 hp marked the start of a long and prestigious legacy for the automobile manufacturer. Over the years, Rolls-Royce has continued to produce highly sought-after and luxurious vehicles, with models such as the Silver Ghost, Phantom, and Silver Dawn becoming synonymous with opulence and prestige.

Title: Tron: Legacy Movie plot: In 1989, seven years after the events of the first film, Kevin Flynn, who has been recently promoted CEO of ENCOM International, disappears. Twenty years later, his son Sam, now ENCOM's primary shareholder, takes little interest in the company beyond playing an annual prank on its board of directors. Alan Bradley, an ENCOM executive and friend to Sam's father, asks Sam to investigate a strange pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade. Sam discovers a large computer in a hidden basement, which suddenly teleports him to the Grid, a virtual reality created by his father that exists within ENCOMâs computer mainframe.[6] He is quickly captured and sent to \\"the Games\\", where he is forced to fight a masked program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and begins bleeding, Rinzler realizes that Sam is a human \\"User\\" and takes him before Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program who resembles a younger Kevin Flynn. Clu nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an \\"apprentice\\" of Flynn, who conveys him to his father's hideout outside Clu's territory. Flynn reveals to Sam that he had been working to create a \\"perfect\\" computer system and had appointed Clu and Tron (a security program created by Bradley) its co-creators. During this construction, the trio discovered a species of naturally occurring \\"isomorphic algorithms\\" (ISOs) not conceived by Flynn, bearing the potential to resolve various mysteries in science, religion and medicine. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, seemingly killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. Meanwhile, the \\"I/O portal\\" permitting travel between the two worlds had closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Now that Clu has gained complete control, he sent the message to Alan in order to lure Sam onto the Grid and reopen the portal for a limited time.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Step 1: Determine the initial number of blue balls.

Jamie lost 6 red balls, so we subtract that from his initial count of red balls. 16 red balls - 6 lost balls = 10 remaining red balls Step 3: Determine the combined number of red and blue balls after losing some red ones. We add the remaining red balls to the blue balls. 10 remaining red balls + 32 blue balls = 42 red and blue balls Step 4: Calculate the number of yellow balls Jamie bought. To find the number of yellow balls, we will subtract the combined number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls (74) Jamie had after buying the yellow balls. 74 total balls - 42 red and blue balls = 32 yellow balls So, Jamie bought 32 yellow balls to fill up his collection."},{"question":"The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique.

Use a funnel or a piece of paper shaped into a funnel, put the smaller end into the hole, and add the desired amount.

This method also minimizes spillage and keeps the surrounding workspace clean. The second option, (2). Use a funnel or a piece of paper shaped into a funnel, put the smaller end next to the hole, and add the desired amount, is not an efficient solution because the dirt and gravel are likely to spill around the hole, potentially making a mess and requiring more effort for cleanup.

Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public, as she believes that talking about it can be \\"a career weakness\\". Rolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \\"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\\" The magazine also takes note of her \\"ease with glad-handing\\", and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as \\"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\\". While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \\"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\\". Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model. Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.

If I keep having so much trouble with it, I may not finish it: As per your own experiences so far, you've been struggling a lot with it, resorting to seam rippers and expressing frustration. There is a strong possibility that if these issues persist, you might decide to leave the quilt unfinished. Quilting takes a considerable amount of time, patience, and skill. If the experience is more about frustration than it is about creating something beautiful to you, it could lead you to leave the project altogether. (ii). None of the above choices: This option is a possibility as well. Your feelings towards the quilt might change over time. You might find that after a break, you feel more inclined to finish it. Or you might come up with a new idea on how to move forward with it, that is not expressed in the options given. (iii). I am going to hide the quilt so no one else tries to take it from me: While you've expressed some frustration with the quilt, you have still invested a good deal of time and energy into it. It's possible that your attachment to it, because of the work you've put in, could lead you to want to keep it to yourself, especially if you fear someone else may not appreciate it or treat it properly. However, the main issue discussed doesn't necessarily involve others' potential interaction with the quilt. (iv). The pattern calls for a thin border so I will make it: This seems unlikely at this moment. You mentioned that the pattern calls for a wide border which you are currently unwilling to make due to lack of enthusiasm. Based on this, it seems you are not planning to follow the pattern to the letter, and might not decide to go for a thin border instead. In conclusion, based on your experiences and sentiments thus far and considering the options provided, the first option appears to be most likely - If you continue having much trouble with it, you may decide not to finish the quilt. However, moods and perspectives change over time, especially in creative processes. Giving the quilt some time to \\"hide\\" as you mentioned, might bring back the enthusiasm needed to finish the quilt in the future."},{"question":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

This phenomenon is usually accompanied or followed by regional malnutrition, starvation, epidemic, and increased mortality. Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history. Some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, continue to have extreme cases of famine. This region remains the most affected area in the world, and because of climate change, agricultural conditions fluctuate more and more. Most programmes direct their aid towards Africa.<ref name=\\"http://www.poverties.org Famine in Africa\\"></ref> - Epidemic typhus (also called \\"camp fever\\", \\"jail fever\\", \\"hospital fever\\", \\"ship fever\\", \\"famine fever\\", \\"putrid fever\\", \\"petechial fever\\", \\"Epidemic louse-borne typhus,\\" and \\"louse-borne typhus\\") is a form of typhus so named because the disease often causes epidemics following wars and natural disasters. The causative organism is \\"Rickettsia prowazekii\\", transmitted by the human body louse (\\"Pediculus humanus humanus\\"). - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Typhoid fever, also known simply as typhoid, is a bacterial infection due to \\"Salmonella\\" Typhi that causes symptoms which may vary from mild to severe and usually begin six to thirty days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. Weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and headaches also commonly occur. Diarrhea is uncommon and vomiting is not usually severe. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases there may be confusion. Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months. Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected; however, they are still able to spread the disease to others. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with paratyphoid fever. The cause is the bacterium \\"Salmonella\\" Typhi, also known as \\"Salmonella enterica\\" serotype Typhi, growing in the intestines and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include poor sanitation and poor hygiene. Those who travel to the developing world are also at risk and only humans can be infected. Diagnosis is by either culturing the bacteria or detecting the bacterium's DNA in the blood, stool, or bone marrow. Culturing the bacterium can be difficult. Bone marrow testing is the most accurate. Symptoms are similar to that of many other infectious diseases. Typhus is a different disease. A typhoid vaccine can prevent about 30% to 70% of cases during the first two years. The vaccine may have some effect for up to seven years. It is recommended for those at high risk or people traveling to areas where the disease is common. Other efforts to prevent the disease include providing clean drinking water, better sanitation, and better handwashing. Until it has been confirmed that an individual's infection is cleared, the individual should not prepare food for others. Treatment of disease is with antibiotics such as azithromycin, fluoroquinolones or third generation cephalosporins.

He founded the Weigl Institute in Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine), where he conducted vaccine research. - Rickettsia is a genus of nonmotile, gram-negative, nonspore-forming, highly pleomorphic bacteria that can be present as cocci (0.1 m in diameter), rods (14 m long), or thread-like (10 m long). The term rickettsia, named after Howard Taylor Ricketts, is often used interchangeably for any member of the Rickettsiales. Being obligate intracellular parasites, the \\"Rickettsia\\" survival depends on entry, growth, and replication within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells (typically endothelial cells). \\"Rickettsia\\" cannot live in artificial nutrient environments and is grown either in tissue or embryo cultures; typically, chicken embryos are used: a method developed by Ernest William Goodpasture and his colleagues at Vanderbilt University in the early 1930s. - A biologist, is a scientist who has specialized knowledge in the field of biology, the scientific study of life. Biologists involved in fundamental research attempt to explore and further explain the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter. Biologists involved in applied research attempt to develop or improve more specific processes and understanding, in fields such as medicine, industry and agriculture. - Ludwik Fleck ( 11 July 1896 -- 5 June 1961 ) was a Polish and Israeli physician and biologist who did important work in epidemic typhus in Lwów , Poland , with Rudolf Weigl and in the 1930s developed the concept of the \`\` Denkkollektiv '' ( \`\` thought collective '' ) . The concept of the \`\` thought collective '' is important in the philosophy of science and in logology ( the \`\` science of science '' ) , helping to explain how scientific ideas change over time , much as in Thomas Kuhn 's later notion of the \`\` paradigm shift '' and in Michel Foucault 's concept of the \`\` episteme '' . - Zakopane (pronounced ) is a town in the extreme south of Poland. It lies in the southern part of the Podhale region at the foot of the Tatra Mountains. From 1975 to 1998 it was in Nowy Scz Province, but since 1999 it has been in Lesser Poland Province. It had a population of about 28,000 . Zakopane is a center of \\"Góral\\" culture and is known informally as \\"the winter capital of Poland\\". It is a popular destination for mountaineering, skiing, and qualified tourism. - A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \\"wild\\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are being investigated). - Lviv (', ', ; Yiddish: ; Latin: \\"Leopolis\\"), the largest city in western Ukraine and the seventh largest city in the country overall, is one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine. Named in honor of the Leo, the eldest son of Rus' King Daniel of Galicia. It was the capital of the Kingdom of GaliciaVolhynia (also called Kingdom of Rus') from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King Casimir III the Great who then became known as the King of Poland and Rus'. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland and was known as Lwów. In 1772, after the First partition of Poland, the city became the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and was renamed to Lemberg. In 1918 in a short time was the capital of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. Between the wars, the city was known again as Lwów and was the centre of the Lwów Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic. After World War II, it became part of the Soviet Union (Ukrainian SSR) and in 1991 of independent Ukraine. Administratively, Lviv serves as the administrative center of Lviv Oblast and has the status of city of oblast significance. Its population is . - Typhus is any of several similar diseases caused by \\"Rickettsia\\" bacteria. The name comes from the Greek \\"typhus\\" () meaning smoky or hazy, describing the state of mind of those affected with typhus. The causative organism \\"Rickettsia\\" is an obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium that cannot survive for long outside living cells. It is transmitted to humans via external parasites such as lice, fleas, and ticks. While \\"typhoid\\" means \\"typhus-like\\", typhus and typhoid fever are distinct diseases caused by different genera of bacteria. - Ticks are small arachnids, part of the order Parasitiformes. Along with mites, they constitute the subclass Acari. Ticks are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Ticks had evolved by the Cretaceous period, the most common form of fossilisation being immersed in amber. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates. - Rickettsia prowazekii is a species of gram-negative, alphaproteobacteria, obligate intracellular parasitic, aerobic bacteria that is the etiologic agent of epidemic typhus, transmitted in the feces of lice. In North America, the main reservoir for \\"R. prowazekii\\" is the flying squirrel. \\"R. prowazekii\\" is often surrounded by a protein microcapsular layer and slime layer; the natural life cycle of the bacterium generally involves a vertebrate and an invertebrate host, usually an arthropod, typically the human body louse. A form of \\"R. prowazekii\\" that exists in the feces of arthropods remains stably infective for months. \\"R. prowazekii\\" also appears to be the closest free-living relative of mitochondria, based on genome sequencing. - Fleas are small flightless insects that form the order Siphonaptera. They are external parasites of warm-blooded animals, living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds. The adults are up to about long and usually brown. They are flattened sideways to enable them to move through their host's fur or feathers, and have strong claws to prevent themselves from being dislodged. They are wingless insects, with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood and hind legs adapted for jumping. They can leap a distance of some 50 times their body length, a feat second only to jumps made by froghoppers. The larvae are worm-like with no limbs; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris.

Let's break down the options: 1. Apartment: While some people might call for a taxi to pick them up at their apartment, it's not a common place to find one just waiting. Apartments are private properties, and taxis are not usually stationed there. 2. Street corner: This is a common place to find a taxi, especially in busy cities. People often wait on street corners where there is high visibility and easy access for taxis to stop and pick them up. 3. Space shuttle: A space shuttle is not a place where people would look for a taxi. Space shuttles are used for space travel and are not connected to the taxi transportation industry. 4. Public place: This is another common location to find a taxi. In addition to street corners, people can find taxis in areas with high foot traffic, such as outside train stations, bus stops, airports, hotels, and shopping centers. Some cities also have designated taxi stands in popular public places where taxis are readily available. 5. Garden: A garden is not a typical place to find a taxi.

Minus star players Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres, Liverpool saw their 1-0 first leg advantage wiped out in just four minutes in Turkey when Colombian international Teofilo Gutierrez put Trabzonspor ahead. But Roy Hodgson's side drew level seven minutes from time as Trabzonspor's Giray Kacar turned a Glen Johnson cross into his own net.

Born in a footballing family with his father and three brothers involved in the game, Wilkins played as a midfielder. He began his career at Chelsea, where he was appointed captain at the age of 18, and later played for the likes of Manchester United, Milan, Queens Park Rangers, and Rangers. He won 84 caps for the England national football team from 1976 to 1986, playing at UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cups. Wilkins signed with A.C. Milan in the summer of 1984. He later remarked that the most difficult part of adapting to the Italian game was the focus on fitness - the coaching staff made him work to reduce his body fat levels and Wilkins described the result as being in the best shape of his career. The Italian team was struggling during this period, having suffered relegation in the 1981-82 Serie A, and Wilkins was joined by fellow Englishman Mark Hateley (himself replacing another compatriot - Luther Blissett). The only foreign players in the squad, the pair helped the team to victory over rivals Inter in the Milan Derby that October, winning plaudits from Italian press and the club's fans. In his first year there, Wilkins played 28 Serie A games to bring the team to fifth in the league and also won a runner-up medal in the Coppa Italia (having eliminated Inter in the semis). The following season he remained a key player in Milan's midfield, appearing in 29 league games and scoring two goals - one late goal to salvage a draw at Avellino and another goal the following game against Sampdoria. These were the only Serie A goals of his career. Overall, the team struggled for goals, with Pietro Paolo Virdis's total of 13 making him the club's only goalscorer in double figures that year. The club also suffered off the pitch, with owner Giuseppe Farina absconding to South Africa following accusations of bribery and theft. In Wilkin's final season there (1986-87), he fell out of the first team structure, following the signing of Roberto Donadoni and the continued presence of both Agostino Di Bartolomei and Alberigo Evani. The team finished fifth in the league, beating Inter twice, in Silvio Berlusconi's first year as owner. Wilkins played 105 games (74 in Serie A) for Milan between 1984 and 1987. Corriere della Sera eulogised him as a \\"serious and meticulous professional who was immediately appreciated for his long and precise passes\\". Wilkins signed for Paris Saint-Germain in the middle of 1987, but this proved to be short-lived: he failed to break into the team ahead of Gabriel Calderon and Safet Susic so he eagerly took the option to signed for Rangers for PS250,000 that November. At the Scottish club he won two league titles and one Scottish League Cup under Graeme Souness. He achieved cult status for his volley in the Old Firm game against reigning champions Celtic in August 1988, giving Rangers the lead in a 5-1 win against their rivals.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures. Paragraph: Jennifer stores her bread in the cupboard when she gets home from the grocery store since she thinks it tastes better that way. Martha grew up in a household that always kept their bread in the freezer so that's what she does with her bread. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which woman's bread will grow mold slower? The answer is:","response":"Martha's bread will grow mold slower because she stores it in the freezer. Freezing temperatures slow down chemical reactions, including the growth of mold, thus preserving the bread for a longer period of time compared to storing it in the cupboard, like Jennifer does. Storing bread in a cold environment, such as a freezer, reduces the rate at which mold grows and hence delays spoilage."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie opens with a car speeding along a dirt road. The woman driving (Jan Holden) is telling her boyfriend, Chris (Barry Lowe) to \\"Hold on, well get help soon, were coming to the main road.\\" He has a large dark blister on his face. He's delirious, grabs the steering wheel, and tries to run the car off the road. They enter a \\"T\\" intersection and nearly crash into the car Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Dunlevy) is driving. Quatermass gets out of his car and walks over to the other. He's very angry and shaken, but inquires about the burn on the man's face. The woman hands him some rock fragments and tells him they were responsible for the burn. She tells him they were in Winterton Flats for a picnic. Quatermass helps push the car back onto the road, when Chris bolts from the car. They wrestle him back into the car. Credits roll. (Note: The British Version is called Quatermass 2, while the American version of this movie was titled Enemy from Space.)At the Rocket project we see a building with a radar antenna mounted on the roof. Two operators are watching the screen. They notice scores of objects coming down slowly. They track the objects to one hundred miles north of their location. As they reset the equipment, Quatermass drives up. He notices the antenna setting and is very annoyed. He scolds Brand (William Franklyn) and Marsh (Bryan Forbes) for what he perceives as unauthorized use of the scanner.He tells Marsh and Brand that tomorrow none of them may have jobs. He gives Marsh the stone fragments and tells him to have them analyzed and classified. He apologizes to Brand and tells him that the moon project is to be cancelled. He outlines the project scope in front of a scale model--to build a colony on the moon. As he prepares to get in his car he points to the rocket ship on the launch pad and tells Brand, \\"Can you still bear to look at it? The sum total of our achievement up to now--one Rocket, crewless, untried.\\" He leaves for the rocket launch area. Brand returns to the radar room and notices more... Answer:","response":"Considering the movie plot provided, a possible question that could be generated is: \\"In the film, what is the significance of the rock fragments Jan Holden gives to Professor Bernard Quatermass, and how do they relate to the mysterious objects detected by the radar operators at the Rocket project?\\" This question delves into the central mystery of the narrative, as it ties together the seemingly unrelated events of Chris's burn from the rock fragments and the unusual activity detected by the radar operators at the Rocket project. The rock fragments provide an initial clue to the events unfolding in the story, suggesting a potential threat or unknown danger connected to Winterton Flats. Additionally, this question highlights the investigative aspect of Professor Quatermass's character, as he seeks to uncover the truth behind these occurrences. Lastly, the question encourages an analysis of the movie's themes and larger implications, as the plot revolves around the moon colony project and the potential dangers of space exploration, whether they are external threats or internal conflicts related to the project. Overall, this inquiry effectively encompasses multiple aspects of the story and would lead to a comprehensive discussion of the film's plot, themes, and characters."},{"question":"M: I will show you next week.

After an inconsistent run of form this season, the Northern Irish club faces a defining moment in their quest for domestic glory. The Importance of the Forthcoming Matches A contrasting season has put Linfield's title ambitions in a precarious position, with the 51 times Irish Premiership champions facing a renewed challenge from their rivals. Healy understands the urgency of the situation and has stressed the importance of coming out victorious in their forthcoming games. Furthermore, Healy is all too aware of the dangers posed by both Ards and Ballinamallard United. Despite their modest league positions, they have proven to be awkward opponents for the premiership's leading outfits. Healy knows that complacency could see Linfield's title hopes dashed before they even face their traditional rivals in the season's decisive fixtures. A Testing Time for Healy's Management Skills This crucial juncture in the season provides a stern test for David Healy's managerial capabilities. The Northern Irish football legend must find a way of instilling confidence, determination, and resilience into his squad to ensure they pick up maximum points against Ards and Ballinamallard United. In doing so, Healy can silence his doubters and underline his credentials as a top-class manager capable of guiding Linfield to long-term success. His motivational skills will need to be at their sharpest to inspire a team that has, at times, appeared to lack the ruthless consistency required to claim the title. Identifying Key Threats and Combating Complacency Healy will be tasking his players with identifying the key threats posed by both Ards and Ballinamallard United, and will undoubtedly remind them that these so-called 'lesser' opponents have demonstrated their ability to cause major upsets. In this unpredictable league landscape, nothing can be taken for granted. The Linfield manager will also be eager to prevent any sense of complacency among his charges, continually reminding them of the vital importance of securing positive results in the coming matches. As the club's title hopes hang in the balance, there is no room for error. A United Front and Fan Support Healy will also be looking to the Linfield faithful for their unswerving support during these critical times. Despite the challenges that face the team, the power of the supporters can make a world of difference. The players need the backing of their fans more than ever, and the Windsor Park faithful must provide the wind beneath their wings. Conclusion In summary, the message is clear: David Healy's Linfield side faces a make-or-break moment in their quest for title glory. The matches against Ards and Ballinamallard United may not possess the glamour and prestige of some of the club's other fixtures, but they may have just as much bearing on the destination of the league trophy. If Healy can mastermind the necessary victories, he will have taken a significant step towards proving himself as the right man for the job. Linfield's title chances may be on a knife-edge, but with the right attitude, determination, and fan support, they can keep their dreams alive."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What key details about mike sheldon can be extracted from the following bio?

Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard. - Kirkbymoorside is a small market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, about north of York, midway between Pickering and Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park.

It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000. - A gnomon ([nomn], from Greek , \\"gnmn\\", literally: \\"one that knows or examines\\") is the part of a sundial that casts a shadow. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Helmsley is a market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England.

It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A sundial is a device that tells the time of day by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky. In the narrowest sense of the word it consists of a flat plate (the \\"dial\\") and a \\"gnomon\\" which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different \\"hour-lines\\" which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The \\"style\\" is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or \\"nodus\\" may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, a wire or an elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude. - The Howardian Hills take their name from the Howard family who still own local lands, and are located between the Yorkshire Wolds, the North York Moors National Park and the Vale of York.

Question: What can a country do when it has jealousy but a person cannot do? Options: A. hug B. wage war C. compete D. judge E. love else","response":"While individuals can certainly experience jealousy, it's important to understand that countries don't have emotions or feelings like people do. However, if we interpret the question as referring to actions that a country may take in response to rivalry or competition with other nations, we can analyze the options provided: A. Hug - Hugging is a physical act performed by people to show affection or comfort, which does not apply to a country. B. Wage war - War is an organized and often prolonged conflict carried out by states or non-state actors. In the context of this question, a country may initiate a war due to intense competition or rivalry for resources, political dominance, or ideological reasons. So, \\"waging war\\" could be considered an action that a person cannot do, but a country may undertake, particularly within historical contexts. C. Compete - Both individuals and countries can compete in various domains. For individuals, competition may be seen in sports, academics, or careers; for countries, competition can manifest in economic growth, innovation, or national achievements. D. Judge - Judgment is a process that can be conducted by both individuals and countries. People can judge one another based on personal beliefs and attitudes, while countries can exercise judgment by enacting laws and making decisions on international affairs. E. Love/Care for others - Feelings of love or care for others are emotions experienced by individuals. However, countries may show concern for other nations through international aid, diplomacy, and trade partnerships, although these actions are driven by the government or its representatives. Based on the analysis above, the most fitting option that a country can do in response to rivalry or competition, but a person cannot do, is B.

They are distinct from \\"Microdon\\" by the presence of an appendix on vein R4+5. Many species have erroneously been placed in this genus. Some authors place \\"Ceratophya\\" as a subgenus of \\"Microdon\\". - Afromicrodon is an African genus of hoverflies . The species of the Afromicrodon genus were previously and erroneously placed in the genus Ceratophya . Afromicrodon species are recognized among the Microdontinae by them lacking an appendix on vein R4 +5 , having short antennae about as long as the face or shorter , and a simple basoflagellomere and simple scutellum without calcar . The abdomen is oval . - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Hover flies (family Syrphidae) of the genus Microdon are unusual among the Diptera. Like other members of the subfamily, they are myrmecophiles, meaning they inhabit the nests of ants. There are 249 species are known worldwide, with the greatest diversity being from the tropics; 30 species are known from North America, though it is expected that many of these species will be placed in other genera in time, as \\"Microdon\\" has been used as a catch-all for various unrelated species not placed in other genera.

But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant.

They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

Question: What is the name for the intricate emotions that Turner came up with? Context: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.

You can also pick up this fungus from the floor of a public shower or other damp areas. After acne, athlete’s foot is the most common skin disease in the United States. Therefore, the chance of coming in contact with the fungus in one of these ways is fairly high. Two brothers worked out a few times per week at the same gym.

Options: - suburbs - large house - farm house - palace - country estate Explain why a human would choose \\"large house\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"large house\\" as the answer to the question above primarily because of the architectural and contextual features mentioned, which suggest that the given property is more likely to be a large house than any other option. Here's a breakdown of the reasons: 1. Back courtyard: A back courtyard is often associated with sizable properties, typically those with enough outdoor space to accommodate a separate, enclosed area at the rear of the building. This feature suggests that the building in question might be more prominent than a simple suburban home. 2. Walkout basement: A walkout basement is a type of basement that has an exterior entrance via a door, often leading to a garden or a backyard. This feature is more commonly found in larger homes where there is enough space on the property to create a separate, ground-level entrance to the basement area. 3. Contextual clues: The options provided, such as the farm house, palace, and country estate, hint towards a property with substantial living and outdoor space. However, a palace is characterized by its grandeur and royal ties, while a country estate typically encompasses a large land area with multiple buildings and gardens, a farm house is generally associated with agricultural properties. 4. General relevance: Out of the given options, \\"large house\\" seems to be the most fitting choice for the described property. The term \\"large house\\" encompasses a variety of architectural styles, shapes, and sizes, but generally implies a building with enough space to accommodate a walkout basement and a back courtyard without being overly grand, like a palace, or restricted to a particular context, like a farm house or a country estate. Taking these factors into account, a human would likely choose \\"large house\\" as the most suitable response to the question."},{"question":"Paragraph: How can you describe your location? You might use a familiar system. You might say, 'I live at 1234 Main Street, Springfield, Ohio.' You could also say, 'I live right behind the Elementary School.' This method uses the school as a point of reference. Another example is, I am at the corner of Maple Street and Main Street. Both streets may be a good reference for anyone living in your town. Scientists must be able to pinpoint a feature they are studying. Scientists use a special system to describe locations. They use latitude and longitude as a reference. Lines of latitude and longitude form a grid. You may have used a grid system while doing graphing. This grid is centered on a reference point. Zero latitude is the equator. Lines of latitude run east to west. They divide the Earth from North to South. Lines of longitude run from north to south. They divide the Earth from East to West. Zero longitude runs through Greenwich, England. You may have heard the term, Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT. The system of latitude and longitude works well for objects that do not move.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, let's examine each statement step by step: 1. The premise: \\"The Need for Multi-pollutant Legislation\\". This statement suggests that there is currently a necessity or demand for legislation that tackles multiple pollutants simultaneously. It implies that such legislation may not exist or may not be sufficient, but it doesn't confirm it outright. 2. The hypothesis: \\"There is no legislation that addresses multi-pollutants.\\" This is a straightforward statement claiming that no such legislations exist. Thinking logically, if the premise is true (there is a need for multi-pollutant legislation), this could suggest that the current legislations are inadequate or non-existent. However, it doesn't definitively confirm the hypothesis. Need for such legislation could also stem from current legislations being ineffective, outdated, or not comprehensive enough, not necessarily from a total absence of them. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively affirm that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This is because the premise doesn't unambiguously confirm the claim made by the hypothesis. It supports the possibility, but doesn't confirm it. So, to confirm the hypothesis, we would need additional direct evidence that there indeed is no current legislation which covers multi-pollutants."},{"question":". Find small ways to touch your guy to show him that you’re interested and leave him longing for more physical contact. For example, nudge him a bit with your elbow during a conversation or touch his forearm a bit when you're speaking. If he touches back, it’s usually a sign he's interested in you as well. While you want the guy to know you’re interested in him, don’t do anything that you’re not comfortable with. If touching him feels like too much at first, just try standing close until you feel more comfortable. . Fit little compliments into the conversation. Make sure that you mean what you say, though, because he’ll probably be able to tell if you’re just giving him a line. Look for moments where you can work what you admire about him into a the conversation naturally. When you first begin flirting, you can use somewhat generic phrases. For example, you might say, \\"It was so good seeing you yesterday!\\" As you get to know him more, work organic compliments into the conversation. For example, if he mentions that he's wondering what to wear to a sporting event over the weekend, you might something like, \\"You always dress really nice so I'm sure you'll find something great.\\" Smiling is a good way to come off as flirtatious. During a conversation, work on keeping a smile throughout. You can also try to laugh lightly at his jokes and smile more when he says something sweet or interesting. Eye contact can also help. Try holding his gaze for a few seconds and then glancing away. It may seem strange, but people are attracted to those who subtly mimic their body language. You don’t have to imitate everything he does, but mimic small, subtle gestures. For example, if you see him cross his legs, cross your legs too. Try mimicking hand gestures. If he tends to wave his hands around as he speaks or to make a point, try doing the same. If he is leaning in towards you, lean in towards him too. You may want to send your guy a physical note, but a flirty text can also work. Don't make it outright flirty if you haven't established that kind of relationship, though. Just show that you're thinking of him. For example, you might send a quick text that says, \\"Just wanted to say hi! ;)\\" You can also text or send a note with a quick question. For example, \\"How was your day?\\" Summary:","response":"To show a guy you're interested, you can try these small actions: gently touch him during conversations, give him genuine compliments, smile and laugh when talking with him, make eye contact and glance away, copy some of his small gestures, and send him friendly messages.

The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois. Shortly after the Cruise family arrives at their new home, Eric becomes suspicious of the alien's presence. The next morning, he finds that the creature has trashed most of the house and learns its identity, but is blamed alongside his brother by their mother for what has happened. After seeing the creature again, Eric tries to catch up to him, but ends up sliding down a hill and falls into a lake, where he nearly drowns, but is rescued by the alien. Eric is not believed at all when he tries to tell his family about the creature's actions. Later that night, he sets a trap with the help of his new friend, Debbie, who had also seen the alien.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? crock pot Choices: -- can make roast chicken with power on -- can make jello with power on","response":"To accomplish the goal of using a crock pot for cooking, you have two available choices: making a roast chicken with power on or making jello with power on. Here, we will provide detailed instructions on how to go about each choice. Option 1: Making roast chicken with power on: Ingredients: - 1 whole chicken (3-4 lbs) - 1 tablespoon olive oil - Salt and pepper, to taste - 1 teaspoon paprika - 1 teaspoon garlic powder - 1 teaspoon onion powder - 1 teaspoon dried thyme - 1 teaspoon dried rosemary Instructions: 1. Clean and pat dry the chicken. Remove the giblets, if any, and trim any excess fat. 2. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, and dried rosemary. 3. Rub the chicken with olive oil, then apply the spice mixture generously all over the skin. Make sure to get some spices under the skin as well, and rub some inside the cavity. 4. Place the seasoned chicken into the crock pot, breast side up. Do not add any liquid, as the chicken will release enough of its own juices as it cooks. 5. Cover the crock pot and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 4-6 hours, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F. 6. Once the chicken is fully cooked, carefully remove it from the crock pot using a pair of sturdy tongs or a large spatula. Place the chicken on a serving platter and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before serving to help retain its juices. Option 2: Making jello with power on: Ingredients: - 1 package (3 oz) of flavored gelatin - 1 cup boiling water - 1 cup cold water - Optional: fruit, whipped cream, or other topping of your choice Instructions: 1. Empty the gelatin package into a large mixing bowl. 2. Stir the boiling water into the gelatin, mixing continuously until the gelatin is fully dissolved. 3. Add the cold water to the gelatin mixture, stirring until well combined. 4. At this point, if you wish to include fruit pieces or other additions, gently fold them into the liquid jello. Make sure to use fruits that are compatible with the gelatin flavor, and avoid fruits like pineapple, kiwi, and papaya, as they may prevent the gelatin from setting. 5. Pour the jello mixture into the crock pot and cover the crock pot with its lid. 6. Turn the crock pot on to the \\"warm\\" setting and let the jello set for at least 3-4 hours or until it reaches a firm consistency. 7. Once the jello has set, turn off the crock pot and carefully remove the jello using a spatula or serving spoon. 8. Place the jello in a serving dish and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes to ensure that it is completely cold before serving. 9. Once chilled, serve the jello with whipped cream, fruit, or any other desired toppings. There you have it – two different ways to use a crock pot to accomplish your goal. Depending on the occasion and your personal preferences, you can choose either option to create a delicious and satisfying meal or dessert."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: How might someone feel if they were committing perjury? Options: - embarrassment indictment - tension - going to jail - penalty - mistrial The answer is \\"tension\\" because Answer:","response":"When someone is committing perjury, they are knowingly and intentionally providing false testimony under oath. This can be a very stressful situation, as the individual is not only violating the law but also acting unethically and dishonestly. Consequently, the prominent feeling that someone might experience while committing perjury is 'tension'. Several factors contribute to the feeling of tension in this circumstance: 1. Fear of detection: Individuals committing perjury are putting themselves at risk of facing severe consequences if their deception is discovered. These consequences can include criminal charges, potential imprisonment, fines, or being held in contempt of court. This fear serves as a constant source of tension as the person is aware of what may happen if they are caught. 2. Internal conflict: Committing perjury-induced discomfort may arise from the internal moral and ethical conflict. Individuals must reconcile their dishonest actions with their sense of self, personal values, and integrity. The mental strain can lead them to feel more tension. 3. The stakes in question: Often, the reason why someone decides to commit perjury is because the outcome of the legal case may have significant impacts on their life or the lives of others. These high stakes can exacerbate the feeling of tension, as the individual is well-aware of the potential consequences of their dishonest actions. 4. Keeping the story straight: When providing false testimony, it is crucial to maintain consistency and coherence in the story. This can be a challenge, as the person may have to remember and manage intricate details and ensure that their statements align with other pieces of evidence or testimonies. The burden of maintaining a fabricated narrative adds to the individual's tension levels. 5. Strained interpersonal relationships: The act of committing perjury can cause strain in the relationships of the person involved. Friends, family, or colleagues may lose trust and respect for the individual once they learn about their dishonest actions. This inevitable change in their interpersonal dynamics adds to the tension they experience. In conclusion, someone committing perjury is likely to feel tension due to various factors, including fear of detection, internal conflict, the high stakes at hand, the challenge of maintaining a fabricated story, and strained interpersonal relationships. These factors generate significant stress and anxiety, making tension the most accurate option among the choices provided."},{"question":"Generate a positive review for a place.","response":"Title: A Heavenly Day at Magnolia Gardens - An Oasis for the Soul Visiting Magnolia Gardens was like discovering a treasure trove hidden within a bustling city.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - play video games - teach parents - reach over - run - rush around Answer:","response":"When children are in a hurry, the most suitable option from the given choices would be that they rush around. To provide a detailed explanation - children, who often have a bundle of energy and are naturally impulsive, are known to act hastily when they feel pressed for time or are eager to get somewhere or to complete an activity. There could be various reasons behind children being in a hurry. For instance, they might be excited about an event like a birthday party or joining their friends at the park. Anxiety could also be a triggering factor, such as wanting to be the first in line, or the fear of being late to their class or activity session. Additionally, a child may feel the need to finish a task or chore quickly so that they can indulge in their recreational pursuits, like playing video games or hanging out with friends. Under such circumstances, children might not pay full attention to their surroundings or to the task at hand. As a result, they may become careless, leading to accidents, an increase in noise levels, or a higher likelihood of breaking or damaging items around them. This hurried behavior often forces them to multitask or take shortcuts, which has the potential to impact the overall quality and outcome of their tasks or activities. In contrast, when children are encouraged to slow down, practice mindfulness, and allocate ample time for their tasks and chores, they tend to perform better. Over time, they learn that completing tasks thoroughly and thoughtfully brings about more positive results, helps them develop a better understanding of their responsibilities, and fosters a sense of accomplishment. To conclude, among the options provided, rushing around best describes what children might do when they are in a hurry. It is essential to teach them the importance of time management, mindfulness, and patience to enable a well-rounded development and ensure they accomplish tasks with greater efficiency and quality."},{"question":"Q: Sickle cell disease is caused by production of an abnormal type of what?

The tent, which had been erected amidst the rugged wilderness, served as a temporary storage and shelter for the traders’ goods. The man, whose name was Thomas, had stumbled upon this location purely by chance. He was an adventurer and had been traveling for weeks through the uncharted territories. Despite being weary and famished, he never veered away from his insatiable thirst for exploration and discovery. Today, discovering the tent filled with supplies felt like a small victory in itself. As Thomas deftly sliced through the leather of the tent, his eyes widened in surprise at the variety and amount of goods ensconced within its confines. The four large boxes were not just labeled with the names Hayworth Trading Company, Elysian Trading, Sterling & Co, and Narthex Imports, but were also overflowing with valuables and necessities. He couldn't help but wonder how these boxes had ended up here, in the middle of nowhere, and what had happened to the traders. Upon opening the boxes, Thomas discovered that the Hayworth Trading Company's box contained a mix of textiles, ornately embroidered fabrics, and rare animal hides. The Elysian Trading box was filled with a plethora of exotic spices and herbs. Intrigued by the seemingly endless supply of foreign goods, Thomas carefully and meticulously examined each item, making sure he didn't miss any hidden treasure. Sterling & Co.'s box revealed a variety of metal tools, intricately designed and of the highest quality. It was evident that the craftsmen who had forged these implements were exceptionally skilled, and Thomas knew that these tools could prove to be invaluable during his journey. The Narthex Imports box was laden with preserved foods in sealed tin containers, much to Thomas' delight. His appetite had been gnawing at him for some time, and he couldn't wait to indulge in a much-needed feast. Not finding any wine bottles or skins in the boxes was disappointing, but it barely dampened Thomas' spirits. He reasoned that there must have been another box with the alcohol, perhaps one that had been hidden away or had not been delivered yet. Nevertheless, he felt incredibly fortunate to have uncovered these supplies, and he knew that they would considerably aid him in the days to come. With an undeniable sense of satisfaction, Thomas began to strategize how best to utilize the newfound supplies as well as how to transport them along his journey. He pondered whether to use the fabrics for clothing or shelter, and how to ration the preserved food to ensure that it lasted as long as possible. The thought of bartering some of the goods with other travelers crossed his mind, allowing him even more resources and perhaps some much-coveted wine as well. As the day turned into evening, Thomas sat beside the tent, still filled with excitement about his discovery. The ingenuity and resourcefulness of trading companies and their ability to reach such remote areas inspired him, and he vowed to continue his journey with renewed determination. Regardless of the absence of wine bottles or skins, today had undoubtedly been a good day for Thomas, one that would remain etched in his memory for years to come."},{"question":"Given the question: Given the below context: Hotshot businessman Bill Campbell has returned to his hometown of Buzzsaw at the request of his younger sister Marci, who is convinced that their stepfather Mayor Van Der Haven has been murdered and replaced by his twin brother Matt Skearns.

The tweet reads: \\"trying to figure out why I can't follow 'JaegerM' on twitter - but he can follow me .... ? He doesn't show up in 'search' for me\\" The sentiment of this tweet can be characterized as a combination of curiosity, confusion, and a hint of frustration. Let's examine each sentiment element further. 1. Curiosity: The user begins their tweet by stating that they are \\"trying to figure out\\" a situation. This suggests they are attempting to understand an issue they are facing on Twitter, specifically about not being able to follow a particular user. The user is seeking information or an explanation for the problem they've encountered, which indicates a degree of curiosity. 2. Confusion: The core issue that the user highlights in their tweet is that they cannot follow a specific user and are unsure why this is happening. This uncertainty is reiterated by the use of both a double period and ellipsis (....?), showing the user's confusion regarding the situation. In addition, the fact that the user in question does not appear in the search results further contributes to the sentiment of confusion, as the reasons behind such disparities in the interaction between the two accounts remain unclear. 3. Frustration: Though frustration is not the prevailing sentiment in the tweet, it can be inferred from the user's tone. The user questions why they are not able to follow another account while the other user can follow them. This discrepancy might create a feeling of annoyance or irritation, as the user is unable to access and engage with the content they are interested in. Moreover, the inability to find the user in the search results may intensify the sense of frustration as it appears to be an unexplained issue regarding the platform's functionality. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be characterized as a blend of curiosity, confusion, and a touch of frustration. The user is trying to understand and resolve an issue they are facing on Twitter, but the lack of clear answers or explanations for the situation causes a sense of perplexity and mild annoyance."},{"question":"Article: As Apple prepares to unveil both a new high-end and low-end iPhone next week, leaked ads from a telecom provider suggest the phones may launch in China as soon as this month. The WSJ's Deborah Kan speaks with Paul Mozur about Apple's new strategy in the country. As Apple Inc. prepares to unveil both a new high-end iPhone and a cheaper version for the first time next week, it is already working on something bigger. The electronics giant has begun evaluating a plan to offer iPhones with screens ranging from 4.8 inches to as high as 6 inches, people familiar with the matter say. That would be a sizable leap from the 4-inch screen of the iPhone 5 released last year, and, at the upper end, would be one of the largest on the market. Such plans signal further that the Cupertino, Calif., company is shifting its smartphone strategy as it searches for new engines of growth, and as competition with Samsung Electronics Co. intensifies . The Korean rival has taken a commanding lead in smartphone market share in part by offering an array of devices at different prices and sizes. On Wednesday, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 3 with a screen measuring 5.7 inches, a size that places the device in a category of hybrid phone-tablets. It is unclear whether Apple will ultimately choose to follow a multi-size, multi-device strategy beyond shipping a new lower-cost model for the first time later this month. The company often tests different devices and configurations before choosing a course. But people familiar with the company's internal deliberations and plans indicate it appears more willing to move ahead than in years past. Component suppliers say Apple already began testing larger screens for iPhones in recent months. Apple has been particularly interested in recent tests for a 4.8-inch screen, these people say. The screen sizes of the two iPhones that Apple is unveiling next Tuesday aren't expected to change, people familiar with the matter have said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. A multi-size strategy would echo Apple's approach to the iPod, as that once-groundbreaking product line matured. Broadening iPhone offerings would also allow Apple to address a threat from Samsung: growth outside the U.S., where Samsung and rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd. are still expanding. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in April the company sees a \\"significant opportunity in China\\" with an unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers there. Increasing sales in the country could also help Apple reverse stalled revenue growth and contracting profits, analysts say. Samsung and other competitors have released numerous products in different sizes and prices in order to cater to a broad swath of customers, particularly in India and China. Apple will for the first time begin shipping two new smartphone products this month, people familiar with the matter say; Samsung alone has released more than half a dozen around the globe so far this year. Apple has waged a public-relations campaign against Google Inc.'s Android software, which powers most Samsung smartphones. In March, just before Samsung's newest \\"Galaxy\\" device was unveiled in New York City, Phil Schiller, Apple's head of world-wide marketing, said the services and hardware on Android handsets \\"don't work seamlessly together.\\" Apple has also filed patent lawsuits around the world against Samsung and other rivals. Last year, Apple released its iPhone 5 with a larger screen, but analysts say changing the size hasn't been enough. Price, too, has caused the iPhone to lag competitors. Apple's newest iPhone starts at 650 without a subsidy; Samsung offers a range of smartphones priced at below 100 in places like China, India and Indonesia. As a result, despite rising unit sales for each of the top smartphone companies, Apple's share of world-wide sales fell to 14% in the second quarter from 19% the same time a year prior. Over the same period, Samsung's share rose to 32% from 30%, according to market research firm Gartner. Samsung's strategy underscores a competitive advantage: The South Korean company is able to bring products to the market more quickly than Apple because it controls the entire manufacturing process for its smartphones. Samsung makes everything from chips to screens at its own factories, allowing it to change designs and pump out new products at a rapid pace. By comparison, Apple relies on many suppliers to make parts for its devices and companies such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Pegatron Corp. in Taiwan to assemble them, requiring timely coordination between all the companies. Apple has some precedent in offering a wider lineup. About three years after it unveiled the first iPod in 2001, Apple launched the iPod Mini, a physically smaller device capable of holding fewer songs. The device was a hit, despite a plethora of competing devices on the market at a lower price, and it attracted many new customers to Apple's offerings. The even smaller iPod Shuffle a year afterward also caught on. Today, Apple maintains four different product lines of iPods and a healthy command of the music device market. The company also for the first time released a smaller version of its iPad, with a 7.9-inch screen, late last year. The standard version of the iPad made its debut at 9.7 inches in 2010. Apple has also been testing larger screen sizes for the iPad, people familiar with the matter have said. Since the debut of the iPhone in 2007, however, Apple executives have debated and tabled plans to offer iPhones in either lower-cost models or in different sizes, according to a person familiar with those discussions. Among the challenges it saw for a lower-cost option was that the company's designers couldn't find a way to make a device that didn't look cheap or look like a close copy of the higher-end iPhone, according to that person. Apple's business model has also been to produce fewer products, at what it argues is a higher quality. Steve Jobs, the company's co-founder who died in 2011, espoused this view often. \\"That's been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity,\\" he once said in a BusinessWeek interview. Later, he said he says \\"no\\" to 1,000 things Apple could do \\"to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much.\\" Apple has until now chosen to release a single new iPhone model each year, and a new case design every two years, in part to keep control of production costs associated with developing, testing and creating tools to manufacture new designs with the exacting quality the company is known for, a person familiar with the matter said. In recent months, Apple has said customers in emerging markets appear to like its cheapest smartphone, the iPhone 4, and has initiated trade-in programs in countries such as India to encourage buying. Mr. Cook said sales there grew more than 400% in the company's third quarter, ended in June. A person familiar with Apple's production also said the iPhone 4S is among the top products Apple continues to sell. People familiar with the matter say Apple's low-cost iPhone will begin shipping alongside the new premium model smartphone and it will be offered in multiple colors. The higher-end device, meanwhile, will include a new feature, a fingerprint sensor, people familiar with the matter said. A version of this article appeared September 6, 2013, on page B1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: 6-Inch iPhone Screen? Apple Tests Bigger Sizes. ||||| With the new iPhone likely to retain the screen size of the current one, Apple Apple finds itself missing out on the fastest growing mobile-device category in the world: The hideously named but increasingly popular market for “phablets.” These 5-to-7-inch phone-tablet hybrids nearly outsold tablets and laptops combined in the last quarter and Apple got exactly zero of those sales. Though the company pioneered the touchscreen smartphone 6 years ago with a then massive 3.5-inch display, the iPhone these days looks tiny compared to the competition. And despite Apple’s reasonable arguments on the merits of maintaining a small screen for one-handed use, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is testing prototypes as large as 6 inches, perhaps prepping its own phablet for 2014. The odd thing about the company’s stubbornness on iPhone screen sizes is that it has never expended much effort insisting users should take its products in one size only and accept it. While the iPod was introduced as a single model, over time it spawned many variants from the smaller Shuffle, Nano and Mini to the larger iPod Touch, which ended up becoming the most popular model. You can still buy Apple’s music player in multiple form factors, depending on your preferences, rather than being told, “music is only to be enjoyed on a player of this particular size.” In laptops, the company is arguably even more flexible. Not only does it offer three screen sizes — 11, 13 and 15 inches — but it also lets you choose from different models in the largest two of those. You want a 13-inch screen but the svelte Macbook Air? Fine. Need some more power but not a bigger screen? The 13-inch Macbook Pro is available for you. Like the 15-inch Pro model, you can choose whether or not you want the extra resolution of the Retina screen or the lower price of a standard one. The move to offer a second size of iPhone, though, would most closely mirror the decision to offer the iPad Mini, which comes with a 7.9-inch screen after the late Steve Jobs famously bashed 7-inch tablets. CEO Tim Cook explained that the Mini isn’t a 7-incher, which is technically true but also is evidence that Apple can change its mind and explain why it isn’t doing that at the same time. The company’s reluctance to offer a larger iPhone has centered on two problems, one physical, one technical. The physical problem is that once you increase the size of the phone from the current iPhone 5, the number of people that can reasonably operate the phone one-handed will shrink a great deal. Already, the decision to increase the screen height last year over the iPhone 4S made it difficult for a lot of people to go from corner to corner with a thumb. Like many iPhone users, I find this capability useful, but only to a point. It’s great when you just grab the phone and can do some things one handed. But typing accuracy plummets that way as does general touchscreen usage and it’s not clear that the loss of everything else a small screen keeps you from is worth it. This problem needs a resolution The technical problem, however, is trickier. Unlike on Android, where there are more than a dozen screen resolutions, Apple has basically two right now with the shorter and taller Retina displays. You either get 960 x 640 in the iPhone 4 and 4S or 1136 x 640 in the iPhone 5. Expect the latter resolution to carry over to both the iPhone 5C and 5S. Once Apple increases the screen size, though, tradeoffs arise. Assuming they stick with the 16:9 ratio common to widescreen TVs and the current iPhone, Apple has a few choices, none of which are great.

The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (e.g., one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, a fortiori, it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added in between the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through.

To make a phone call Answer:","response":"Title: The Unspoken Truth Step 1: Set up the character's background Jim Stevens, a recently single middle-aged man, works as an investigative journalist. He has a habit of getting too deep into his stories, which led to the collapse of his marriage. Jim is sent on an assignment to investigate a string of mysterious disappearances in a small town. Step 2: Establish the setting Upon arriving in the small town, Jim checks into the Whispering Pines Motel. The motel is a secluded and rundown establishment with peculiar staff and a few eccentric guests. As he settles into his room, Jim starts to feel that something is off about the motel. Step 3: Introduce a subplot While investigating the town and conducting interviews, Jim meets a local woman named Sara. Their bond grows as they find comfort in sharing their personal trials and losses. Sara's sister was one of the victims of the unsolved disappearances, and together, they hope to find some answers. Step 4: Present the main conflict One night, Jim discovers a clue in one of the missing people's personal belongings, hinting at a potential connection between the motel and the disappearances. In need of a secure place to report this lead, Jim realizes he must leave the motel room to make a phone call to his editor back in the city. Step 5: Create tension and suspense As Jim steps out to make the call, he senses that he is being watched. He chooses a payphone far from the motel to ensure his privacy. During the call, his editor informs him that they've found a pattern of mysterious deaths connected to the motel dating back decades. Step 6: Climax Upon returning to the motel, Jim and Sara confront the motel owner about the disappearances. The owner initially denies any involvement, but as they press further, he snaps and confesses to being part of a secret cult that worships an ancient dark entity. The cult sacrifices motel guests to maintain their immortality and power within the town. Step 7: Resolve the plot Jim and Sara escape the motel and inform the local police about the cult's activities. A raid on the motel leads to the arrest of the cult members, rescuing several captive victims and putting an end to the disappearances. Sara's sister, however, remains missing, and they vow to continue searching for her. Step 8: Closing thoughts The experience at Whispering Pines Motel leaves both Jim and Sara changed, and they find solace in their newfound friendship. Jim continues his work as an investigative journalist, striving for truth and justice, while learning to balance his personal life."},{"question":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer. Step-by-step reasoning process: If a dog is running through the snow it would imply the animal is outside. The question and answer:","response":"Question: Can dogs safely exercise and play in the snow? Answer: Yes, dogs can safely exercise and play in the snow as long as their owners take necessary precautions. When letting your dog run through the snow, consider the following factors: 1. Breed and size: Some dog breeds, like Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes, are naturally equipped to handle cold weather due to their thick coats. However, small or short-haired dogs may require additional protection, like a dog coat or sweater, to stay warm. 2. Age and health: Young puppies and senior dogs may have a harder time adjusting to the cold. Also, dogs with health issues like arthritis may experience discomfort in cold conditions. Make sure to monitor these dogs closely and provide them with a warm environment. 3. Snow conditions: Keep an eye on your dog when playing in the snow to ensure they’re not ingesting any harmful substances like salt, antifreeze, or de-icers. Also, be aware of signs of frostbite or hypothermia in your dog, like shivering or lethargic behavior, and bring them indoors if needed. 4. Duration of playtime: Limit your dog's outdoor time during extreme cold or snowy conditions to prevent overexposure. Regularly check your dog for any discomfort and be ready to bring them inside if they show signs of distress.

I found the following answer on Google: While the Russians mobilised, the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France, providing a casus belli for Britain's declaration of war against Germany. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","response":"Yes, the answer provided is broadly correct, but it is important to understand that the beginning of World War I was a complex event with multiple factors and actors involved. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914, contributed to the escalation of tensions, but it was not the sole cause. The roots of World War I can be traced back to a tangled web of alliances, rivalries, and disputes among European powers. Factors such as nationalism, imperial competition, and militarism played key roles in fueling the conflict. The specific sequence of events that led to the outbreak of the war involves the following key points: 1. On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in response to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. 2. Because of a pre-existing alliance, Russia began mobilizing its troops in defense of Serbia, which spurred Germany, an ally of Austria-Hungary, to demand that Russia stop mobilizing. 3. Russia refused to halt mobilization, and on August 1, 1914, Germany declared war on Russia. 4. As stated in the provided answer, the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on their way to France, as part of the Schlieffen Plan, which was intended to quickly knock France out of the war. This invasion of Belgium provided a casus belli for Britain, which had an agreement with Belgium to uphold its neutrality. 5. On August 4, 1914, Britain declared war on Germany, and soon after, other countries joined in, forming the two rival blocs - the Allied Powers (including Britain, France, and Russia) and the Central Powers (including Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). So, while the answer provided captures a part of the complex series of events that ultimately led to World War I, it is essential to recognize that the outbreak of the war cannot be attributed to a single person or event. The beginning of the war was the result of a combination of underlying issues and the interconnected relationships between various countries, propelling them towards a devastating global conflict."},{"question":"Rendre compte de la situation mondiale actuelle au chapitre de la prévention et du contrôle intégré des maladies chroniques; 2.

He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. In 1506, Charles inherited his father's Burgundian territories, most notably the Low Countries and Franche-Comte. Most of the holdings were fiefs of the German Kingdom (part of the Holy Roman Empire), except his birthplace of Flanders, which was still a French fief, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the Hundred Years' War. As he was a minor, his aunt Margaret of Austria (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles' requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528. From 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of Frisian peasants (led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijard Jelckama). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523. Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of Tournai, Artois, Utrecht, Groningen and Guelders. The Seventeen Provinces had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were fiefs of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a Pragmatic Sanction, declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs. The Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the wealth of the region's cities, the Low Countries also represented an important income for the Imperial treasury. The Burgundian territories were generally loyal to Charles throughout his reign. The important city of Ghent rebelled in 1539 due to heavy tax payments demanded by Charles. The rebellion did not last long, however, as Charles's military response, with reinforcement from the Duke of Alba, was swift and humiliating to the rebels of Ghent.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What happened after Charles got all these territories?","response":"After Charles V acquired all these territories, he worked on consolidating his rule over them.

Charles issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs. This move aimed to make them a more integral part of his empire. However, the costs of fighting wars and maintaining territories strained his resources, leading to a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Ultimately, he divided his empire between his brother Ferdinand and his son Philip, with Ferdinand gaining the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Habsburg territories, while Philip received Spain, the Spanish Empire territories, and the territories in the Low Countries and Italy."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"In addition to Points, what were there five of?\\" Context: \\"Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s.

If you're using a charcoal grill, fill a chimney half to three-quarters full of briquettes and light them. Dump the hot briquettes on one half of the grate to set up a two-zone fire. Arrange the steaks on the grill over indirect heat, if you're using a charcoal grill. Close the lid and grill the steaks for 5 to 6 minutes without moving them. Open the lid of the grill and use tongs to flip the steaks over. Dip a barbecue brush into a bowl of smoky barbecue sauce or steak sauce. Spread a thin layer of the sauce over the tenderloin steaks and put the lid on the grill. Keep the lid on the grill and continue to cook the tenderloin steaks. Use the lower cooking times for a medium-rare steak. If you want the tenderloin steaks cooked rare, grill them for a minute less than recommended. Open the lid and turn the tenderloin steaks over. Dip the brush in more sauce and spread another thin layer over the steaks. Put the lid on and grill the steaks until they've charred just a little bit. This should take 2 minutes. Remove the lid from the grill and use tongs to transfer the steaks to a plate. Sprinkle the steaks with a little ground pepper, if desired. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil over the steaks and let the steaks rest. They'll finish cooking and the juices will redistribute within the meat. If you grilled small tenderloin steaks, serve them whole or slice them into thin strips and serve them. Consider serving the meat with extra barbecue or steak sauce.

Obligate anaerobes will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen. Clostridium perfringens bacteria, which are commonly found in soil around the world, are obligate anaerobes. Infection of a wound by C. perfringens bacteria causes the disease gas gangrene. Obligate anaerobes use molecules other than oxygen as terminal electron acceptors. Now, I have a new situation: Microbiologist John is studying the anaerobic organism. He collected two samples of this organism, sample A and sample B.

And they may be right. A Swedish study published in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention concludes that digital billboards hold the gazes of drivers longer than two seconds. Previous studies have shown that anything that takes a driver's eyes off the road for that length of time increases the risks of a crash. \\"This study proves what is common sense when it comes to digital billboards,\\" says Mary Tracy, president of Scenic America, a national nonprofit group that seeks to limit billboards. \\"Bright, constantly changing signs on the sides of roads are meant to attract and keep the attention of drivers, and this study confirms that this is exactly what they do.\\" The Federal Highway Administration allowed digital signs for the first time in 2007 after concluding they did not pose a significant danger. But a follow-up report is pending and could be released this year. California has no law banning the billboards, and is one of 39 states that allows them. \\"We would need to review more research, so it's too early to call for a ban,\\" says Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \\"There is a role for digital messaging, such as conveying urgent information and other safety messages.\\" There are more than 1,800 digital billboards nationwide, more than double the number five years ago.

The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: (A)","response":"Question: What is the concept of \\"negative space\\" in art, and why is it important for creating visually appealing compositions? Answer: (A) Negative space, also known as \\"white space,\\" is the unoccupied area surrounding objects or the subject in an artwork. It plays a crucial role in balancing the composition and enhancing the viewer's focus on the primary elements. Justification: Negative space is a fundamental concept in art and design and is highly valued for its ability to impact the overall appeal of an artwork. By giving enough breathing room around elements, negative space prevents the composition from appearing cluttered or overcrowded. It directs the viewer's eye towards the positive space – the focal point or subject of the artwork – improving visual hierarchy, clarity, and balance. When effectively employed, negative space also contributes to the perception of depth, creating an illusion of three-dimensionality in a two-dimensional artwork. This, in turn, adds a dynamic and engaging quality to the piece. Furthermore, the strategic use of negative space can evoke emotions in viewers by allowing their imagination to fill in the emptiness or encouraging them to consider deeper meanings. Several famous artists like M. C. Escher and Georgia O'Keeffe have masterfully incorporated negative space in their works, illustrating its importance in creating visually appealing and thought-provoking art. In conclusion, negative space is a vital aspect of composition for both its aesthetic contributions and its ability to guide viewers and stir their emotions as they engage with the artwork."},{"question":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Very uncomfortable Review: I bought 3 different Posture Corrective Bras that day and this one was so far the most uncomfortable.It looks like it would work but it didn't do it for me.The straps were stiff and uncomfortable and so was the velcro.It sits right under your breasts and makes it impossible to breathe if you put it tight.I am a size 6 petite person,I don't know if it works with other frames.But I returned the item last week and they processed my request right away no questions asked.

For the lucky carriers of \\"Methuselah\\" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern . The \\"Methuselah\\" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare. The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old. Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children. The studies show that tiny mutations in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy. David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread. \\"If we know which genes control longevity then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\\" he told The Times. \\"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged to take it.\\" According to David Gems, _ . A) drugs to slow ageing will be very expensive B) modern science will be able to find more longevity genes C) it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing D) scientists can make new genes that will allow longer life Answer:","response":"C) it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing"},{"question":"Select your answer from the options.

Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To solve this problem, let's first find the total cost of their meals. 1. The cost of each meal: a 20 steak and a 5 drink. Total cost per person = 20 + 5 = 25 Billy and Jenny both order the same meal, so the total cost of their meals is: Total cost for both = 25 × 2 = 50 Now, let's find the 20% tip for both of their meals. 2. Calculate the 20% tip for the total cost: Tip amount = 20% of 50 Tip amount = 0.20 × 50 = 10 3. Since Billy wants to cover 80% of the tip, let's find 80% of the 10 tip. Billy's share of the tip = 80% of 10 Billy's share of the tip = 0.80 × 10 = 8 So, Billy will have to pay 8 in tips to cover 80% of the 20% tip for both of their meals."},{"question":"Possible review types: OPTIONS: a). negative; b). positive;.

Typing in complex scripts becomes immensely easy—not only Hindi and English, but Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Telugu, and much more can be typed without a hitch. The transliteration feature only adds to the convenience, enabling individuals who aren't well-versed with a particular script to still communicate effectively in their chosen vernacular. The predictive text and auto-correct feature are like the cherry on top. The app seems to learn from what we type, making fewer mistakes with each use. This level of customization and learning prowess is something not common with many standard keyboard apps. What’s more, it also has an arsenal of trendy and diverse emojis as well, adding a more fun, engaging way to communicate. Privacy-wise, this application demonstrates great respect.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Q: Context_1 : Split Rock Lighthouse State Park is a state park of Minnesota on the North Shore of Lake Superior. It is best known for the picturesque Split Rock Lighthouse, one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States. Built by the United States Lighthouse Service in 1910, the lighthouse and some adjacent buildings have been restored and the Minnesota Historical Society operates them as a museum. The 2200 acre state park offers a unique cart-in campground and scenic trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, and bicycling. Context_2 : Baldred Rock ( ) is a rock in Fitchie Bay at Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands. It lies close off the south side of Ferrier Peninsula, 0.75 nmi east-southeast of Graptolite Island. This rock was mapped by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition under William Speirs Bruce, 1902–04, and was later named \\"Bass Rock\\" owing to its likeness to the Bass Rock in Scotland. The name Bass Rock has also appeared on charts as an alternative name for an island in the Joinville Island group. To avoid confusion of these names, in 1954 the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee recommended an entirely new name for the rock at Fitchie Bay. Baldred Rock is named after Saint Baldred, the first hermit known to have lived on the Scottish Bass Rock. Context_3 : Black Rock Harbor Light, also known as Fayerweather Island Light, is a lighthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States which stands on the south end of Fayerweather Island and marks the entrance to Black Rock Harbor. The first lighthouse at the site, built by Abisha Woodward under contract with the United States government, was a wooden tower that was lit and made operational by 1808. A storm destroyed the tower in 1821 and the current, stone lighthouse was erected in its place in 1823. The Black Rock Harbor Light was an active navigational aid until 1933 when it was replaced by two automatic lights offshore. The beacon was subsequently given to the City of Bridgeport in 1934. Two significant efforts during the 1980s and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000. Black Rock Lighthouse is listed as a contributing property for Bridgeport's Seaside Park historic district. Context_4 : The Bass Rock Lighthouse on Bass Rock is a 20 m lighthouse, built in 1902 by David Stevenson, who demolished the 13th-century keep, or governor's house, and some other buildings within the castle for the stone. The commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse Board decided that a lighthouse should be erected on the Bass Rock in July 1897 along with another light at Barns Ness near Dunbar. The cost of constructing the Bass Rock light was £8,087, a light first being shone from the rock on the evening of 1 November 1902. It has been unmanned since 1988 and is remotely monitored from the board’s headquarters in Edinburgh. Until the automation the lighthouse was lit by incandescent gas obtained from vaporised paraffin oil converted into a bunsen gas for heating a mantle. Since that time a new biform ML300 synchronised bifilament 20-watt electric lamp has been used. Context_5 : Split Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located southwest of Silver Bay, Minnesota, USA on the North Shore of Lake Superior. The structure was designed by lighthouse engineer Ralph Russell Tinkham and was completed in 1910 by the United States Lighthouse Service at a cost of 75,000, including the buildings and the land. It is considered one of the most picturesque lighthouses in the United States. Context_6 : New Brighton Lighthouse or Perch Rock Lighthouse, is a decommissioned lighthouse situated at the confluence of the River Mersey and Liverpool Bay on an outcrop off New Brighton known locally as Perch Rock. Together with its neighbour, the Napoleonic era Fort Perch Rock, it is one of the Wirral's best known landmarks. Context_7 : The Bass Rock, or simply the Bass ( ), is an island in the outer part of the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland. Approximately 2 km offshore, and 5 km north-east of North Berwick, it is a steep-sided volcanic rock, 107 m at its highest point, and is home to a large colony of gannets. The rock is uninhabited, but historically has been settled by an early Christian hermit, and later was the site of an important castle, which after the Commonwealth period was used as a prison. The island belongs to Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, whose family acquired it in 1706, and before to the Lauder family for almost six centuries. The Bass Rock Lighthouse was constructed on the rock in 1902, and the remains of an ancient chapel survive. Context_8 : Halfway Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on a barren ledge in Casco Bay, Maine. The lighthouse tower, which has a height of 76 ft , and the attached ex-boathouse are all that remain, as the other buildings have been taken away in storms. The name \\"Halfway Rock\\" comes from the position of the rock which is halfway between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Small, the southwest and northeast extremities of Casco Bay, which are about 18 nmi apart. Context_9 : Ida Lewis Lighthouse, which was formerly the Lime Rock Lighthouse, is in the Newport harbor in Rhode Island. It is named after Ida Lewis, who lived and worked at the lighthouse from 1857 and was the official lighthouse keeper from 1879 until her death in 1911.

At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. The most significant failure of Roman Catholic missionary work was in Ethiopia. Although its ruler, Emperor Susenyos, had publicly declared his conversion to Catholicism in 1622, the declaration of Roman Catholicism as the official religion in 1626 led to increasing civil war. Following Susenyos' abdication, his son and successor Fasilides expelled archbishop Afonso Mendes and his Jesuit brethren in 1633, then in 1665 ordered the remaining religious writings of the Catholics burnt. On the other hand, other missions were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism. The first Catholic Church was built in Beijing in 1650. The emperor granted freedom of religion to Catholics. Ricci had modified the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among other things the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called Chinese Rites controversy in 1692 and 1742. Answer this question based on the article: The Chinese were allowed to venerate the dead by what authority?","response":"The Chinese were allowed to venerate the dead by the authority of Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary who had modified the Catholic faith to accommodate Chinese thinking and cultural practices. Ricci's approach was focused on integration and adaptation, which led him to permit certain customs, such as the veneration of the dead, in an effort to appeal to the local Chinese population and facilitate the spread of Catholicism in China. This decision, however, was later disputed and eventually forbidden by the Vatican in the Chinese Rites controversy of 1692 and 1742, as they disagreed with the adaptation of Catholic practices."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: There are new findings that not enough sleep may cause people to gain weight.Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night.

This reduced energy consumption could lead to less environmental impact, which in turn may create a more stable ecosystem and promote the availability of food for owls.

The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"He wants the woman's father to repair his bike.\\" In the given dialogue, the woman mentions that her father often repairs bikes for people. Upon hearing this, the man expresses that he has a broken bike. By mentioning his broken bike in response to the woman's statement about her father's skill in repairing bikes, it is implied that the man is interested in seeking the woman's father's assistance to repair his bike. The first option, \\"He wants to get rid of his broken bike,\\" is not accurate here, as there is no indication that the man simply wants to dispose of his bike. Rather, his statement suggests that he is interested in fixing the broken bike. The second option, \\"He wants the woman to repair his bike,\\" is also not the correct answer, as the man does not directly ask the woman to repair the bike. Instead, he shares information about his broken bike in response to the woman's statement about her father's bike repair skills, implying that he is more interested in her father's help.

It has several common names, including: aplodontia, mountain boomer, ground bear, and giant mole. The name sewellel beaver comes from \\"sewellel\\" or \\"suwellel\\", the Chinookan term for a cloak made from its pelts. This species is the only living member of its genus, Aplodontia, and family, Aplodontiidae. It should not be confused with true North American and Eurasian beavers, to which it is not closely related. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The term Sciuromorpha has referred to numerous groups of rodents , but the only family common to all variations is the Sciuridae , the squirrels . Most definitions also include the mountain beaver . Traditionally , the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal . A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum . Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents , the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal . Among extant rodents , only the families Sciuridae , Castoridae , Heteromyidae , and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous . Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch. Carleton and Musser ( 2005 ) redefined rodent suborders on the basis of a host of both morphological and molecular reasons . They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families , Sciuridae , Aplodontiidae , and Gliridae . Of these , only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous . The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous . The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past . The two families have been united into a common infraorder ( Sciurida ) or superfamily ( Sciuroidea ) . It has long been suggested that dormice ( Gliridae ) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha , and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed \`\` pseudomyomorphy '' . The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies , and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys . - The Eurasian beaver or European beaver (\\"Castor fiber\\") is a species of beaver which was once widespread in Eurasia. It was hunted to near-extinction for both its fur and castoreum; and by 1900, only 1200 beavers survived in eight relict populations in Europe and Asia. Reintroduced through much of its former range, it now occurs from Great Britain to China and Mongolia, although it is absent from Italy, Portugal, the southern Balkans, and the Middle East. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. What entity does 'sciuromorpha' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Hello, little friends! Today we are going to talk about a very interesting topic - the percentage of people who were not Hindu. Before we start, let's learn a few things first. Can you tell me what Hinduism is? Good question! Hinduism is a major world religion that many people practice. It mainly comes from a country called India. People who follow this religion are called Hindus. Now let's get back to our main question - how many percent of people were not Hindu? To find this out, we need to know three things: 1. How many people are there in the entire world? 2. How many people are Hindus? 3. What's a percentage? First, let's talk about how many people there are in the entire world. Did you know that our planet Earth has over 7.9 billion people? That's a huge number, isn't it? Now let's see how many people are Hindus. According to the available data, around 1.2 billion people in the world are Hindus. Oh, what's a billion? It means one thousand million. Wow, that's a lot of people! Finally, let's learn what a percentage is. A percentage is a way of showing a number as a part of 100 (one hundred). So if we say 50 percent, it means 50 out of 100. Do you understand? Great! Now, let's find out how many people are not Hindus. First, we'll subtract the number of Hindus from the total number of people in the world: 7.9 billion (total people) - 1.2 billion (Hindus) = 6.7 billion (people who are not Hindus) Now, we'll find the percentage of people who are not Hindus. To do this, we'll divide the number of people who are not Hindus by the total number of people in the world, and then multiply the result by 100: (6.7 billion / 7.9 billion) × 100 = 84.81% So, about 84.81% of people in the world were not Hindu. Isn't it amazing how we can find so many things just by using numbers?

It aims to help with achieving a greater understanding of the behavior of children through an understanding of their minds. It deals with children who range from the prenatal stage right up to the stage of adolescence. The psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) has been credited with making a major breakthrough in this area when he put forward his idea that children were not actually less intelligent than adults, rather they just thought in a different way. Preciously the development of children right from birth through to adulthood was an area that was almost completely _ . In fact very little work was done in this area. However, interest in this field has now developed to the point of being one of the most debated of all the areas of psychology. Despite popular belief that factors such as genetics or personal characteristics are the only determining factors that influence a youth's behavior, this is not in fact the case. In reality, development actually includes many more factors than those contained within an individual. Factors such as environment, which can include social relationships and the surrounding culture, also play important roles. Relationships with both peers and adults will no doubt affect how children think and learn, and therefore develop. These relationships can include those that are found not only within families but also in schools and peer groups. Culturally speaking, this factor will contribute greatly to how children develop their personality concerning the values they end up holding (perhaps for a lifetime) as well as how they view such things as traditions and customs. Nowadays, psychologists have agreed that a child's psychology is both unique and highly complex. However, there are debates on many different points in this field and many viewpoints exist.

One helmet plowed into another. Dorsett's head snapped back, his helmet was knocked askew. \\"He blew me up,\\" Dorsett told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"I don't remember the second half of that game, but I do remember that hit.\\" Dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a Volkswagen. These days Dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one Ray Ellis laid on him that day. In the past two years, Dorsett's memory has given him increasing trouble. On Monday, doctors at UCLA told Dorsett, 59, he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the Hall of Famer said. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The only way to definitely diagnose CTE is after death, by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau, which has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players. Opinion: Why I'm saying goodbye to football. However, a pilot study at UCLA may have found tau in the brains of living retired players. Some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the \\"holy grail\\" of CTE research, providing a means to diagnose and treat it, and the UCLA study may be an important first step. Using a scan called a positron emission tomography, or PET, typically used to measure nascent Alzheimer's disease, researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau. Then, the players' brains are scanned. \\"We found (the tau) in their brains. It lit up,\\" Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study, said in February. Dr. Joseph Maroon, a neurosurgeon who works with the Pittsburgh Steelers, cautioned Thursday that the CTE diagnoses of Dorsett (and two other living former players) need further study. \\"This is very, very preliminary,\\" he told Sportsradio 93-7 The Fan in Pittsburgh. \\"There are many, many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss, particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age. ... It's something to obviously be concerned about, and the question is what can be done about it?\\" Dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings. \\"Memory loss, more so than anything it's been my big deal,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that. But my thing was not remembering. I've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden I forget how to get there.\\" His daughters are afraid, he said. They wonder which father they will get. Will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood. For others known to have had CTE, symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation. In 2002, Mike Webster, a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression and bone and muscle pain. What you need to know about concussions in the NFL. Unlike Webster, who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice, Dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact. He won the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player in 1976 and became an instant NFL star on the league's most popular team, the Dallas Cowboys. He played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards, eighth best of all time. His 99-yard run in 1982 is an NFL record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. Now he looks in a mirror and wonders. \\"And I say who are you? What are you becoming?\\" he said. \\"It's very frustrating to be a person that's been so outgoing, then all of a sudden, I'm like a couch potato.\\" Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior, such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, 36, who died in a 2004 high-speed chase. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancÃ©e. Opinion: NFL takes good first step to protect players. Some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives, including former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters, who shot himself in 2006; Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze; and Junior Seau, the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43. Dorsett said that won't happen to him. \\"I'm going to beat this. Trust me,\\" he said. Dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners. He said a 765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the NFL was not enough. \\"I can't put a price on my health. The owners knew (about the dangers of concussions) for years and they looked the other way, and they kept putting us players in harm's way.\\" The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs. NFL concussion settlement raises questions.

A study at UCLA may have found a way to see this disease in living people's brains, which can help doctors understand and treat it better. However, more research is needed to make sure it's accurate.

Bennett wrote The Book of Virtue in which he suggested that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett's book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values, just like honesty, courage, loyalty and many others. For Americans, one basic moral value is honesty. The story about George Washington and the cherry tree teaches this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favourite cherry tree. When his father asked him about it, George said, \\"I did it.\\" Instead of punishment, his father spoke highly of him. Sometimes American honesty--being open and direct--can make people angry. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best virtue\\". Another virtue is perseverance . A story tells of a little train climbing a hill. The hill is too high to get over it. But the train just kept pulling, all the while saying, \\"I think I can, I think I can.\\" At last, the train was over the top because he did not give up. Compassion may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man with compassion. On his way home, he found a poor traveler lying on the road. The kind man, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. Compassion can even turn into a good cycle.

Over the course of a 15-year Formula One career beginning in 1955, Brabham won three drivers' world championships, becoming the first Australian to win the title despite coming late to the sport. The first two titles, in 1959 and 1960, were earned as a driver for the Cooper team. The third and most notable occurred in 1966, when, at 40-years-old, he won racing for Brabham, the successful car manufacturer and racing team he founded. \\"When I started out in","response":"Formula One, I never imagined that I would achieve the success that I did,\\" Brabham said in a statement reflecting on his incredible career. \\"It truly has been an incredible journey, from my humble beginnings in a small workshop in Sydney to winning championships and standing on the top step of the podium around the world. Racing has been a passion of mine since I was a young boy, and to have been able to turn that passion into a career is something I am extremely grateful for.\\" Brabham's path to success was not without its challenges, as he had to learn the intricacies of car engineering and racing tactics on the fly. But his natural talent for racing and his dogged determination to win saw him rise through the ranks of motorsport. His ambition fueled not only his own success but also the success of the Brabham racing team, which continued to thrive after his retirement from driving. Sir Jack Brabham's legacy extends far beyond his impressive statistics and achievements on the track. His influence in the world of motorsports, particularly in the realm of engineering and team management, has left an indelible mark on the industry. Through his pioneering efforts and innovative thinking, Brabham was able to propel the sport to new heights of speed, performance, and safety. His passion for motorsports did not wane after his retirement; in fact, it only grew stronger. Brabham continued to make significant contributions to the sport, mentoring the next generation of drivers, engineers, and team owners. He was a consultant to various racing teams and a passionate advocate for promoting motorsports in his beloved Australia. The world of Formula One mourns the loss of this racing legend and icon, who will forever be remembered for his unwavering commitment to the sport and for being a trailblazer both on and off the track. Jack Brabham's dedication, determination, and passion for racing have inspired countless individuals to chase their dreams and pursue careers in the fast-paced world of motorsports. \\"Sir Jack Brabham gave so much to the sport we all know and love,\\" reflected the racing community upon hearing of his passing. \\"He leaves behind a legacy that will never be forgotten, and his spirit will forever continue to inspire generations of racers to come.\\""},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

But, how far has a kicker gone to set a record? Let's explore the world of field goals while answering the question: How many yards was the longest field goal? To understand the significance of the record-breaking field goal, it's essential to have an overview of what field goals are and their role in football. In the National Football League (NFL) and college football, a field goal is a method of scoring that takes place when a team kicks the ball through the goalposts, specifically between the uprights and over the crossbar. If successful, the scoring team is awarded three points, often proving crucial for determining the outcome in close games. The longest field goal in NFL history stands at an astonishing 66 yards. Denver Broncos kicker Brandon McManus held the previous record of 64 yards, which he achieved on December 8, 2013. However, the new record was set by none other than the Detroit Lions' kicker, Matt Prater, on September 26, 2021. During a regular-season game against the Baltimore Ravens, Prater's record-breaking kick took place on the last play of the first half. Facing a staggering distance, Prater did not let the pressure deter him. The ball sailed through the air and successfully passed between the goalposts, firing up his teammates and fans alike. This landmark accomplishment didn't go unnoticed. Prater's kick was considered so significant that it overshadowed the rest of the game and made several headlines in various sports media outlets. The feat also solidified Prater's place in NFL history and earned him the title for the longest field goal ever made in a professional football game. The success of such an attempt depends on various factors, not least the kicker's skill, precision, and incredible leg strength. In addition, environmental factors such as the wind, temperature, and altitude play a significant role. For instance, it is common knowledge that higher altitudes contribute to a ball traveling a greater distance. As both the Broncos' and the Lions' stadiums are situated at high altitudes, this might have been a contributing factor. However, this does not undermine the sheer skill and talent required to achieve such a feat, as kickers across the league, regardless of the stadium, often face incredibly challenging conditions. Prater's 66-yard field goal serves as an inspiration to kickers worldwide, offering a glimpse into the sport's potential as it continues to evolve. It is worth considering if the record could be broken in the future – after all, Matt Prater's legendary kick has already left its mark by shattering a standing achievement. As players continue to push their physical limits and refine their technique, we might witness even longer and more remarkable kicks, pushing the boundaries of possibility even further. In conclusion, Matt Prater's record-breaking 66-yard field goal is undoubtedly a testament to the power of skill and determination in sports. Not only did it break previous records, but it also inspired kickers, football players, and fans worldwide. With athletes constantly striving for improvement, we can expect the remarkable world of football to continue offering thrilling and surprising moments that reshape the history of the game."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here's a logic test: The tree branch was much thicker than the flower branch so it was (A) weaker (B) stronger Choose the answer between \\"Tree Branch\\" and \\"Flower Branch\\".

However, as the season progressed, Mauricio Pochettino realized that he needed to make major changes to both the lineup and tactics in order for the team to improve. The manager decided to focus primarily on developing the young talents available at the club, nurturing the potential of up-and-coming stars like Dele Alli, Harry Winks, and Harry Kane. This move proved to be a turning point for Tottenham as they started to climb up the league table, with their newfound youthful energy, coupled with Pochettino's tactical maneuvering. Meanwhile, the club's hierarchy made a critical decision in the following transfer window, recognizing the need for a strong leader in the backline to replace the departed Michael Dawson. After scouting various options, they settled on signing an experienced and vocal central defender with promising leadership qualities. The new addition to the team quickly integrated himself into the squad, forging strong partnerships with the talented youngsters already cemented in the team. Together, they managed to find a good balance, with the defense looking much more organized and solid than before. Slowly but surely, Tottenham began to claw their way back up, stringing together an impressive run of positive results. The improved performances saw them qualify for European competition, providing the club with an opportunity to boost their revenues and showcase Spurs on the continental stage. The strong finish to the season allowed Pochettino to regain the faith of both the fans and the board, with many giving him credit for his brave decisions and tactical nous.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step in the given process is the mating of adult butterflies. This process relates to the life cycle of a butterfly, and it traditionally begins with the mating or reproduction stage, which results in the laying of eggs. Let's go through each step in this process: 1. Mating of adult butterflies: This begins with the courtship between male and female butterflies. The male butterfly will typically perform various rituals, such as dancing and producing sounds, to attract a female. Once the female is ready to mate, the male butterfly will attach himself to her and transfer his sperm to her, fertilizing her eggs. Adult butterflies have many ways of finding mates, including the use of visual cues and pheromones. This is the step that was missing from the original list you provided. 2. An egg is laid: After mating, the female butterfly will lay her fertilized eggs on the leaves of a host plant that will provide the necessary food for her offspring after they hatch. She attaches her eggs to leaves with a special kind of glue which hardens quickly, keeping the eggs in place. 3. The egg hatches: Depending on the species and environmental conditions, the egg can hatch anywhere from a few days to a few weeks after being laid. The creature that emerges is a caterpillar, or larva. 4. A larva emerges: The freshly hatched larva eats its own eggshell as its first meal and then continues to eat and grow, consuming plant material. 5. The larva eats and grows: It will eat almost constantly, pausing only to molt, or shed its skin, which is becoming too tight because of its rapidly expanding body. 6. The larva sheds its skin: This process is also known as molting. As the larva grows, it needs to shed its old skin and produce a new one. 7. The larva enters a chrysalis: After a few rounds of molting, the larva will find a safe place to attach itself and form a chrysalis, or pupa. Some species build silk cocoons around the chrysalis for added protection. 8. The pupa grows inside the chrysalis: Within the chrysalis, the caterpillar's body undergoes a complete transformation in a process known as metamorphosis. The old body parts are broken down, and the new adult butterfly structures are formed. 9. The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis: When the metamorphosis is complete, the adult butterfly will emerge from the chrysalis, initially weak and vulnerable. It has to pump fluids into its wings to expand them and wait until they are dry before it can fly. 10. The adult butterfly is now fully grown: It may take a few hours for its wings to dry and harden before it can start flying, seeking out nectar from flowers, and begin the mating process to repeat the cycle. 11. The adult butterfly lays more eggs: If a female, she will mate with a male and then lay her fertilized eggs on the leaves of a host plant, beginning the cycle anew. By understanding these steps, you can clearly see the extraordinary metamorphosis process that every butterfly undergoes, from a simple egg to a caterpillar, then to a chrysalis, and finally transforming into an elegant and beautiful butterfly.

Very, very few films were longer than that back then, but that is definitely NOT what sets this odd little film apart from the rest! No, what's different is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are bugs...yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so perhaps that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a heck of a lot more realistically than King Kong 21 years later! The film starts with Mr. Beetle sneaking off for a good time. He goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he is caught on camera by a local film buff. Plus, he doesn't know it but Mrs. Beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter. Of course, there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is age-old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike. Weird but also very amazing and watchable.

The reviewer highlights the uniqueness and novelty of the film, especially the use of bugs (or models resembling bugs) as actors, which sets it apart from other productions of that time.

The reviewer describes the film as a \\"simple little domestic comedy\\" similar to works starring famous comedians like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, or Max Linder, suggesting that it is entertaining and enjoyable. They also note the age-old and entertaining plot that appeals to both adults and kids, further emphasizing the film's positive qualities. However, the reviewer does use the word \\"weird\\" to describe the film, which could be interpreted as a slight negative remark.

Article: We use our smart phones to carry out many tasks every day. Many of us have become so _ on them. However, it is bad for our eyes and health to use too much phone. A study shows that smart phone owners usually start to use their phones early in the morning. They check persona1 emails and Wechat. And before they get out of bed, many people often check the weather, read the news, and send a message or two to friends. After getting up, they often take photos of food, themselves, and even whatever they can see with their phones. They share their photos with their friends. The research finds that users pick up their phones more than l,500 times to do different tasks in an average week. And the smart phone users are on their phone for three hours and sixteen minutes a day. That is to say, people use their phones for almost one full day each week. Using phones will take much time and it's also bad for our health. Many people stay up late to play phones, And mobile phones will influence our sleep.

Please fix it.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the review, I would cautiously recommend this app with a \\"Maybe\\" to a friend. The reason for this is that the reviewer's experience with the app appears to have been negative, stating that it did not work on their cellphone and that it did not even start. This raises concerns about the app's compatibility, performance, and reliability. However, it is also important to keep in mind that this review is just one individual's experience. The app may have worked perfectly fine for others with no issues, and it is possible that the reviewer's technical problems were specific to their device or circumstances. Additionally, the developer might have been responsive to the feedback and may have already addressed the issue. Therefore, while this single review does not inspire confidence, it is also not enough information to completely dismiss the app as a recommendation for a friend. I would suggest seeking more information and reviews from other users before making an informed decision. It would be important to consider factors such as the app's overall ratings, feedback from other users, its compatibility with different devices, and whether the developer has responded to the concerns raised in the review.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same as they address different topics. I will provide you with detailed answers for each question separately. Question 1: Why do I create conversations in my head? Creating conversations in your head is a common psychological phenomenon known as \\"inner speech\\" or \\"internal dialogue.\\" There are several reasons why people engage in this form of mental activity: 1. Problem-solving and decision-making: Internal conversations can help you think through problems, weigh pros and cons, and evaluate possible outcomes. By imagining various scenarios and how people might react, you can better prepare for real-life situations. 2. Emotional regulation: People often use inner speech as a way of processing emotions, such as experiencing frustration, anger, or sadness. Imagining conversations can help you express your emotions privately and find ways to address them constructively. 3. Cognitive rehearsal: Inner conversations often involve practicing potential interactions with others. This mental rehearsal can help to improve communication skills and increase self-confidence in social situations, especially if you anticipate challenging discussions or confrontations. 4. Self-reflection: Internal dialogue allows you to explore your own thoughts and feelings, as well as evaluate your actions and behaviors. This helps you to better understand yourself and inform your choices, promoting personal growth and self-awareness. 5. Creativity and imagination: Creating mental conversations stimulates the imagination, which can be a source of creative inspiration. This can be particularly helpful for artists, writers, and people seeking innovative solutions to problems. In summary, creating conversations in your head can serve essential cognitive, emotional, and social functions, helping you cope with various challenges in your life and making you more adaptable and resilient. Question 2: What is known as an element? In chemistry, an element is a substance that consists of only one type of atom. Atoms are the smallest building blocks of matter and are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Each element has its own unique properties, which determine how it interacts with other elements to form compounds. There are 118 known elements, of which 94 occur naturally on Earth. Elements are organized in the periodic table, which groups them based on their atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. Elements can be grouped into categories such as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, based on their shared properties. Here are some examples of elements: 1. Hydrogen (H) - The lightest and most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen forms water (H2O) when combined with oxygen. 2. Carbon (C) - An essential component of life on Earth, carbon is the backbone of organic molecules and can form an extraordinary range of chemical bonds. 3. Gold (Au) - A precious metal known for its unique properties such as conductivity, resistance to corrosion, and malleability, gold has been used for coins, jewelry, and electronic components. 4. Oxygen (O) - A vital element for life, oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration and makes up about 21% of Earth's atmosphere. 5. Silicon (Si) - The second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, silicon is a key component in semiconductors, which are crucial for modern electronics. In summary, an element is a pure chemical substance consisting of a single type of atom, and each element has its unique physical and chemical properties. The periodic table organizes these elements, helping scientists understand their relationships and how they interact to form compounds."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: I heard that Riley took the puppy for a walk after bringing it home from the shelter.

The Mariana Trench is located in the western Pacific Ocean and reaches a maximum depth of approximately 11,000 meters (36,000 feet) at a location known as Challenger Deep. So far, there have been four descents to the bottom: 1. The first descent was a manned mission conducted on January 23, 1960, by the United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe Trieste. This Swiss-designed, Italian-built vessel was manned by Lieutenant Don Walsh and scientist Jacques Piccard. They successfully reached the bottom of the trench at 1:06 pm, using iron shots as ballast and gasoline for buoyancy. The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 meters (37,799 feet), but this was later revised to 10,916 meters (35,814 feet) after analyzing the pressure measurements and water density from the sea surface to the seabed. 2. The second descent was an unmanned mission carried out by the Japanese robotic deep-sea probe Kaikō on March 24, 1995. This remotely operated vehicle successfully navigated the Challenger Deep, sending back valuable data and images of the previously unknown environment. Kaikō was able to measure the depth at 10,911 meters (35,797 feet). 3. The third descent occurred on March 26, 2012, when Canadian film director and explorer James Cameron piloted the Deepsea Challenger, a privately-funded submersible. Cameron reached a depth of 10,908 meters (35,787 feet), where he spent approximately three hours at the bottom of the trench observing, collecting samples, and filming. This mission provided valuable insights into the trench's ecosystem and geological features. 4. The fourth descent was achieved on April 28, 2019, by Victor Vescovo, an American explorer and retired naval officer. He piloted a submersible known as the DSV Limiting Factor, reaching a record depth of 10,928 meters (35,853 feet) at Challenger Deep. Vescovo spent around four hours at the bottom of the trench, collecting samples and conducting tests on the submersible itself. These expeditions have significantly contributed to our understanding of the Mariana Trench's extreme environment and the unique life forms that inhabit it, although much of the trench is still unexplored and many mysteries remain."},{"question":"Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who introduced the band to to cannabis while visiting them in their New York hotel suite? is inside the article: Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

This river is like the tiny streams of water you see in the park, but much, much bigger. They thought this would help them use the water better. However, many people didn't like this idea. They were worried about the lovely plants and animals that live near the river, just like the flowers you see at the park.

Sometimes, it's necessary to change our minds when we realize that some things are too precious to put at risk, like the creatures who live by the river. In the end, the river in Spain was allowed to keep flowing in its natural path, making the plants, animals, and people happy. And the government learned a valuable lesson: it's important to listen to everyone's opinions, especially when it comes to keeping nature safe and beautiful for generations to come.

Answer:","response":"Based on the biography provided, here is the detailed information about Thomas Hafstad: - Caps: Unfortunately, the exact number of caps (meaning appearances made in official matches) for Thomas Hafstad is not mentioned in the bio provided. Caps for a player are typically enumerated for their participation in either national team or club games. For Hafstad, these would include his period at Beisfjord, Narvik/Nor, Mjølner, and Tromsø IL. - Position: During his football career, Thomas Hafstad primarily positioned himself as a right full back, but he also played in midfield. The right full back position is usually responsible for blocking attacks down the sidelines and also supporting the team in offensive plays, while a midfielder typically operates in the space between the defense and the attack, providing links and creating opportunities. - Height: The provided biography does not list Hafstad's height. The height of a player can sometimes be significant in predicting their performance and suitability for certain positions in football, but it is not a necessary detail unless for specific scenarios. - PCUpdate: It isn't clear what is meant by \\"PCUpdate\\" in the context of Thomas Hafstad's biography. Most likely, it could refer to the last time that Hafstad's records were updated on a particular computing or tracking system. However, due to lack of specific information, I can't provide a definitive answer. - Birthdate: Thomas Hafstad was born on March 13, 1974. This date of birth places him in the generation of players active in professional football primarily during the 1990s and early 2000s. - Name: His full name is Thomas Hafstad. The name \\"Thomas\\" is of Greek origin and means \\"twin\\", while \\"Hafstad\\" indicates Nordic influences, likely from his Norwegian background. - Goals: The biography does not provide specific data about how many goals Hafstad scored throughout his career. Depending on his position as a right full back or a midfielder, he might have had different opportunities and responsibilities regarding goal scoring. Historically, both positions have the potential to score, although traditionally, midfielders tend to have more scoring opportunities than full backs. In conclusion, the biography provides some details about Thomas Hafstad's football career, but it's limited in providing specific details such as his total number of caps, height, pcupdate, and the number of goals. To gain more detailed information, further research would be needed, possibly involving digging into sports records and databases that track the careers of players like Hafstad."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Second question: What does the present young generation feel about the hippie movement of the 1960s-1970s that shook the world? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"First question: The name commonly given to the political and social movement that swept Quebec society in the beginning of the 1960s is \\"The Quiet Revolution.\\" This revolution, which took place between 1960 and 1966, was marked by significant social, political, and cultural changes in Quebec. The primary goal of the movement was to modernize and secularize the province, which was heavily influenced by the Catholic Church. The Quiet Revolution also sought to promote self-determination and the affirmation of French-speaking Quebecers as a distinct cultural and linguistic entity within Canada. Key achievements of the Quiet Revolution include the nationalization of the hydroelectric industry, the launch of a comprehensive welfare state, educational reforms, the establishment of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, and a series of labor laws to uplift the working class. The Quiet Revolution also cultivated a strong sense of nationalism and pride among Quebecers, eventually leading to a more assertive stance towards the Canadian government on matters of language, culture, and provincial autonomy. Second question: Young generations of today hold a variety of opinions on the hippie movement of the 1960s-1970s. Some admire the movement for its emphasis on peace, love, freedom, and environmental consciousness, as well as its role in pushing for social justice and progressive change, including civil rights, women's rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. The era's lasting influence on creative expression, including film, art, music, and fashion, is another factor that may appeal to younger generations. On the other hand, some young people view the hippie movement as an overly idealistic and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at societal change. They may criticize the movement's widespread experimentation with drugs, perceived lack of focus, or countercultural practices that were seen as nonconformist or rebellious at the time. For some, the movement may represent a bygone era that's hard to relate to or lacks the relevance to current social issues. These two questions are not asking the same thing. While both pertain to social and cultural movements of the same time period, the Quiet Revolution was specific to Quebec and focused on provincial modernization and the French-Canadian identity, while the hippie movement was a global phenomenon that encompassed broader social change and counterculture."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Ben Kruidbos, the former director of information technology for Corey's office, is seeking more than 5million in damages in the lawsuit filed in Jacksonville, according to a legal documents. Kruidbos was fired after testifying at a pre-trial hearing June 6 that he believed prosecutors had failed to turn over to the defense, as required by evidence-sharing laws, potentially embarrassing evidence extracted from Martin's cell phone. White said the lawsuit against","response":"Corey's office is based on whistleblower protections and wrongful termination under Florida law, claiming that Kruidbos was retaliated against for exposing the alleged misconduct within the prosecutor's office. Furthermore, Kruidbos alleges that this retaliation was a violation of his First Amendment rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances. The lawsuit seeks to hold Corey and the State Attorney's office accountable for these alleged violations and to provide Kruidbos with compensation for the harm he suffered as a result of his termination. The 5 million in damages that Kruidbos is seeking include back pay, front pay, lost benefits, emotional distress, and damage to his reputation. In addition to monetary relief, Kruidbos is also requesting that the court reinstate him to his former position or provide him with a comparable job within the State Attorney's office. There are several key issues in this case that need to be assessed carefully in order to determine the validity of Kruidbos' claims. Firstly, it is crucial to establish whether or not there was actually a violation of evidence-sharing laws by Corey's office in relation to the information extracted from Trayvon Martin's cell phone. If it is found that prosecutors indeed withheld potentially exculpatory evidence from George Zimmerman's defense team, this could lend credence to Kruidbos' argument that he was acting as a whistleblower by coming forward with the information. Secondly, it is important to evaluate whether Kruidbos' termination was connected to his testimony in the Zimmerman trial. If there is evidence to suggest that his firing was in retaliation for his testimony or based on any protected activity under the whistleblower protections, this could significantly strengthen Kruidbos' case. Moreover, the impact of Kruidbos' termination on his professional and personal life must be examined to determine the appropriate level of damages. This can be accomplished by evaluating the loss of income he experienced as a result of his termination, the difficulty he encountered in obtaining new employment due to the damage to his reputation, and the emotional distress he suffered as a result of the circumstances surrounding his termination. Lastly, the defendant's side of the case must also be explored. Corey and her office may have a legitimate defense for dismissing Kruidbos. They might claim that his termination was based on unrelated grounds such as job performance or other professional infractions. In order for Kruidbos to prevail in his lawsuit, he will need to convincingly refute these counterarguments and establish a clear link between his testimony in the Zimmerman trial and his subsequent termination. In summary, Ben Kruidbos' lawsuit against Angela Corey and the Florida State Attorney's office alleges wrongful termination and violation of whistleblower protections stemming from his involvement in the George Zimmerman trial. The outcome of the case will likely hinge on determining the validity of Kruidbos' claims and establishing a clear connection between his testimony and his subsequent termination. The case raises important questions about the importance of evidence-sharing laws in the criminal justice system and the rights and protections afforded to whistleblowers who come forward with information about misconduct within prosecutorial offices."},{"question":"Consider the question.

The couple opted for a modern approach to share the news with their fans and followers, selecting Twitter as their preferred platform to share the exciting update. This refreshing take on a royal birth highlights the significance of the Tindalls' connection to the public and their strong desire to be relatable to their fans and followers worldwide. Choosing the Sweet Name Mia After much anticipation, Mike Tindall announced the adorable name of their newborn daughter - Mia. A spokesman for the couple later revealed that Mike and Zara chose the name Mia due to its simplicity and charm, stating \\"they both liked the name\\". This uncomplicated and endearing choice resonates with modern parents and shies away from the more traditional and elaborate names often associated with royal bloodlines. Mike and Zara’s selections give a nod towards their relatability and grounded approach to parenthood, proving that they aren't out of touch with non-royal families across the globe. A Swift Hospital Visit: A Testament to Zara's Resilience Zara Tindall has always been one to admire for her radiant spirit and incredible resilience. Last week, she gave birth to Mia, adding a second child to their growing family. One remarkable aspect of this birth is that Zara spent only six hours in the hospital following the delivery - a testament to her unyielding strength and determination. This brief stay shows Zara's dedication to be hands-on and involved in her family life, setting an example for many new mothers to follow. Baby Mia's Lineage and Royal Status As the newest addition to the Tindall family, baby Mia is 16th in line to the British throne. While holding a position in the line of succession, she does not hold a royal title. This lack of title is in line with Mike and Zara's preference to raise their children without being entrenched in the traditional trappings of royalty. By keeping Mia from becoming entitled as a royal, they ensure that she grows up in a more down-to-earth environment, focusing on her personal and professional development without the influence of the monarchy. Conclusion The announcement of baby Mia's name and arrival via Twitter showcases Mike and Zara Tindall's connection with the world and their desire to be as relatable as possible. Choosing the sweet name Mia further allows the couple to distance themselves from the stringent traditions and conventions of royalty. With Zara's quick hospital stay and the decision to raise Mia without a royal title, it is evident that the Tindalls are raising their children to be in tune with the world and focused on their individuality rather than a predetermined royal path.

Everest. Can we infer the following? Alison Hargreaves is the first woman to have made the climb up the Everest with no artificial oxygen.","response":"While it is true that Ang Rita Sherpa, a legendary Nepali mountaineer, broke his own record by climbing Mount Everest multiple times, this fact alone does not necessarily allow us to infer information about Alison Hargreaves' achievement. To answer whether Alison Hargreaves became the first woman to climb Mount Everest without artificial oxygen, we need to delve into historical records and information about the accomplishments of female climbers on Mount Everest. Alison Jane Hargreaves, a British mountaineer, is known for her commendable ascents in the world of mountaineering, and she indeed made history. Hargreaves was born on February 17, 1962, in Derbyshire, England, and displayed an early inclination towards climbing, which she pursued professionally as an adult. In May 1995, Alison Hargreaves made headlines by becoming the first woman to successfully reach the summit of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen or support from a Sherpa team. This remarkable achievement distinguished her in the climbing community and made her a well-respected mountaineer worldwide. Unfortunately, Hargreaves' life was tragically cut short when she died at the age of 33 during her descent from K2, another challenging and dangerous peak, later in August 1995. It should be noted that Ang Rita Sherpa's record-breaking climb and Alison Hargreaves' feat occurred independently from one another and that their historical significance is unrelated. While Ang Rita Sherpa's accomplishments showcase his extraordinary skill, perseverance, and ability to adapt to high altitudes, Hargreaves' ascent demonstrates the power and determination of women in mountaineering and the ability to conquer such a demanding summit without the assistance of extra oxygen supplies. In conclusion, we cannot make this inference based solely on the statement about Ang Rita Sherpa breaking his own record, but after researching and verifying the information, it is clear that Alison Hargreaves did indeed become the first woman to climb Mount Everest without the use of artificial oxygen. Both Hargreaves and Sherpa's accomplishments serve as an enduring source of inspiration for mountaineers and adventure seekers worldwide."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

A: OPTIONS: (1). RNA (2). DNA (3). vesicles (4). microfilaments","response":"A: The correct answer is (4). Microfilaments. Microfilaments, composed of twisted actin chains, are found in nearly every eukaryotic cell, including muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape. They have a diameter of about 7 nm and are one of the three main components of the cytoskeleton, which also includes intermediate filaments and microtubules. Microfilaments play an essential role in maintaining the structural integrity, shape, and motility of a cell. The primary protein component of microfilaments is actin, a globular protein that can polymerize to form long helical chains known as filamentous actin (F-actin). The process of forming F-actin filaments involves the reversible polymerization of G-actin monomers, creating a dynamic structure that enables rapid disassembly and reassembly based on a cell's needs. The addition of G-actin to either end of a filament is regulated in a spatial and temporal manner, typically occurring at one end (barbed or plus end) while being removed from the other (pointed or minus end). In muscle cells, microfilaments are crucial for muscle contraction. They organize into contractile units called sarcomeres within myofibrils. Sarcomeres contain two types of filaments: thin filaments made of actin and thick filaments made of myosin, another motor protein. The interaction between actin and myosin filaments enables muscle contraction as part of the sliding filament model, with myosin heads pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere during contraction. Cells that move by changing shape also rely on microfilaments. They undergo a process called amoeboid movement, where cells extend membrane protrusions called pseudopods, which help propel the cell forward. Microfilaments support the formation of these protrusions, providing the necessary force. Additionally, the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments regulate cell membrane activities such as endocytosis (uptake of external materials) and exocytosis (secretion or release of materials). Microfilaments serve other significant functions as well. They form structures called stress fibers, which resist mechanical forces and help maintain cellular rigidity. In epithelial cells, they comprise cell-cell junctions (adherens junctions) and cell-matrix junctions (focal adhesions), which are crucial for tissue organization and integrity. In comparison, the other options provided are not composed of twisted actin chains: (1) RNA: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a single-stranded nucleic acid that is essential in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, gene regulation, and catalysis. RNA does not consist of actin chains. (2) DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a double-stranded helical molecule that encodes genetic information and serves as the blueprint for all cellular processes. DNA does not contain actin chains. (3) Vesicles: Vesicles are small, membrane-enclosed sacs within cells that transport, store, or process materials such as proteins, lipids, and waste products. They are not formed of actin chains. In summary, microfilaments, composed of twisted actin chains, are the structures present in almost every cell, including muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape. They play crucial roles in cellular shape, motility, and structural integrity, making them essential components of the cytoskeleton."},{"question":"around two dozen inmates at a prison in western ukraine have slashed their wrists to protest poor detention conditions , authorities said sunday .

Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu.

Despite this progress, there are still considerable roadblocks hindering their full participation and representation. According to Diane Abbott, a prominent British politician, abuse suffered by female MPs may be one of the primary reasons deterring women from considering a career in politics. State of Women in Politics Today: Step 1 – Present the current situation of women in the political sphere. Globally, the number of women holding political office is increasing, albeit at a slow pace. They have made strides in achieving political prominence, but there is still much ground to cover to attain a balanced representation of genders in the political arena. In parliament, close to 25% of MPs are women, while worldwide, the proportion of national parliamentary seats held by women stands at around 24%. The Impact of Abuse on Female MPs: Step 2 – Provide examples and data on abuse cases suffered by female MPs. Abuse against female MPs is a significant problem, manifesting in various forms: online harassment, physical threats, and sexist or racist remarks. According to a survey by Amnesty International, almost half of female MPs in the UK have experienced some form of abuse related to their work in politics. Furthermore, the death of Jo Cox, a British MP murdered in 2016, has sent shockwaves throughout the political community, serving as a stark reminder of the very real dangers faced by female MPs. Abuse as a Deterrent for Women in Politics: Step 3 – Analyze the impact of abuse on women considering a career in politics. Exposing abuse cases suffered by female MPs is crucial to understanding its impact as a deterrent for women contemplating a career in politics. When women see their fellow female politicians being targeted with threats, hate speech, or gender-based harassment, it can discourage them from entering the political arena. Additionally, the trauma faced by those who have experienced such abuse may lead to women abandoning their political ambitions. Addressing the Problem: Step 4 – Discuss potential solutions or recommendations to tackle the issue. Eradicating the abuse faced by female MPs requires a multifaceted approach encompassing education, legislation, and societal change. Increasing awareness among the public, strengthening laws against online harassment, and fostering an environment where women in politics feel safe and supported, are crucial steps towards addressing this barrier. These efforts can create a positive shift in the perception of politics as a career choice, inspiring more women to step into the world of politics. Conclusion: The abuse suffered by female MPs is impeding women's progress in the political landscape. It is essential for the concerned authorities, the media, and society at large to actively address this issue to ensure that a more diverse and inclusive political environment is created. Only then can truly representative democracies be formed, accommodating a wide range of voices and perspectives that reflect the diverse needs and concerns of their populations."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

However, his world is suddenly destabilised by a series of unexplained murders (including Harold's best friend, Colin) and exploding bombs from an unknown foe. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs. The situation worsens when a pub in which they are about to have dinner at is blown up and Harold's partner, Victoria, tells the Americans that they are under attack from an unknown enemy. She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London. Jeff advises against this and explains that the IRA aren't just annoyed about some of the money which had gone missing, but also wrongly hold Harold responsible for the murder of three IRA men.

This has raised questions about the effectiveness and relevancy of OPEC, the world's leading oil cartel. Dennis Gartman, a renowned economist and author of The Gartman Letter, has been vocal in his critique of OPEC's ability to fulfill its role in the modern economic landscape. This article will discuss Gartman's views on the reasons behind OPEC's demise and the implications for global oil markets. Step 1: Describe Gartman's background Before delving into Gartman's perspective on OPEC, it is essential to establish his credibility. Dennis Gartman, an American economist and commodities expert, has over four decades of experience in international markets. His daily newsletter, The Gartman Letter, offers insight into financial markets to a vast clientele, including banks, hedge funds, and family offices. Step 2: Present Gartman's criticism of OPEC Gartman's main argument against OPEC revolves around its slow reaction to the growing prominence of shale oil and alternative energy sources, as well as its inability to maintain market stability. OPEC, acting as a cartel rather than a competitive market player, has struggled to adapt to the evolving landscape of the energy sector. Step 3: Highlight the role of technological advancements Gartman argues that technological advancements and innovations have played a significant role in diminishing OPEC's influence. The shale revolution, in particular, has allowed the United States to rapidly increase its oil production, rivaling traditional OPEC powerhouses and weakening the cartel's ability to dictate oil prices. Step 4: Discuss geopolitical factors impacting OPEC In addition to technological developments, Gartman also emphasizes the impact of geopolitics on OPEC's decline. Rising tensions between OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Venezuela have contributed to a lack of unity within the organization, further hindering its ability to effectively manage oil production and global prices. Step 5: Examine the significance of alternative energy sources Moving forward, Gartman suggests that the increasing adoption of clean and renewable energy sources could further challenge OPEC's dominance in the energy sector. With the world steadily transitioning towards sustainable energy, the cartel's grip on global oil markets may continue to weaken. Step 6: Analyze the implications for global oil markets Gartman's assertion that OPEC is broken holds significant implications for the global oil markets. As the cartel loses its influence, the era of oil price stability may come to an end, leading to increased market volatility and uncertainty. Furthermore, as countries diversify their energy portfolios, the traditional prominence of OPEC nations in the energy sector may wane, dramatically changing the geopolitical landscape. Conclusion: Dennis Gartman's claim that OPEC is broken is rooted in the organization's inability to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of the global energy sector. As technological advancements continue to reshape the industry and the global shift towards sustainable energy sources gains momentum, it appears that OPEC will continue to struggle to maintain its influence on the world stage. The potential consequences for global oil markets and geopolitics are vast, signaling that the world may be on the brink of a new era in the energy sector."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: no one in hollywood will confuse president clinton 's drug czar with bob dole .","response":"Hollywood won't mistake Clinton's drug czar for Bob Dole."},{"question":"If \\"A tattooed woman in a black dress holds a drink while sitting at a table in a dimly-lit room.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A woman is eating her dinner at home.\\"?","response":"To determine if it logically follows that \\"A woman is eating her dinner at home,\\" I will break down the given statement step by step and analyze it: 1. \\"A tattooed woman in a black dress\\" - Describes the appearance of the woman. 2. \\"holds a drink\\" - Indicates that the woman has a beverage in her hand. 3. \\"while sitting at a table\\" - The woman is seated at a table. 4. \\"in a dimly-lit room\\" - The lighting of the room is described as dim.

In the town of Glipforg, Lem is a teenager with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor, Neera. His best friend is Skiff, a big fan of the Humaniacs films. Lem tries to ask Neera on a date, but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. A mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. On Planet 51, under a secret Army installation called Base 9 (their version of Area 51), there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly arrived astronaut.

Written primarily by George Mason, the resolutions rejected the British Parliament's claim of supreme authority over the American colonies. More than thirty counties in Virginia passed similar resolutions in 1774, \\"but the Fairfax Resolves were the most detailed, the most influential, and the most radical.\\" - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - The Mason family of Virginia is a historically significant American political family of English origin, whose prominent members are known for their accomplishments in politics, business, and the military. The progenitor of the Mason family, George Mason I (5 June 16291686), arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on the ship \\"Assurance\\" in 1652. Mason was a Cavalier member of the Parliament of England during the reign of Charles I of England. George Mason I's great-grandson was George Mason IV (11 December 17257 October 1792), an American patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. Along with James Madison, George Mason IV is known as the \\"Father of the Bill of Rights.\\" For these reasons, Mason is considered one of the \\"Founding Fathers\\" of the United States and raised the Mason family to national political prominence. - The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 178788 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). - George Mason I (5 June 1629 1686) was the American progenitor of the prominent American landholding and political Mason family. Mason was the great-grandfather of George Mason IV, a Founding Father of the United States. - George Mason ( sometimes referred to as George Mason IV ) ( December 11 , 1725 -- October 7 , 1792 ) was a Virginia planter , politician , and a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787 , one of three men who refused to sign . His writings , including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774 , the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 , and his Objections to this Constitution of Government ( 1787 ) in opposition to ratification of the constitution , have been a significant influence on political thought and events . The Virginia Declaration of Rights served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights , of which he has been deemed the father . Mason was born in 1725 , most likely in present - day Fairfax County , Virginia . Mason 's father died when he was young , and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age . He married in 1750 , built Gunston Hall , and lived the life of a country squire , supervising his lands , family and slaves . Mason briefly served in the House of Burgesses and involved himself in community affairs , sometimes serving with his neighbor , George Washington . As tensions between Britain and the American colonies grew , Mason came to support the colonial side , and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause , finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the rebel Virginia Conventions of 1775 and 1776 . Mason prepared the first draft of the Declaration of Rights in 1776 , and his words formed much of the text adopted by the final Virginia Convention . He also wrote a constitution for the state ; others who sought to have the convention adopt their ideas , like Thomas Jefferson , found Mason 's version could not be stopped . During the war , he was a member of the powerful lower house of the Virginia General Assembly , the House of Delegates , but to the irritation of Washington and others , refused to serve in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia , citing health and family commitments . Named one... - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Virginia Declaration of Rights is a document drafted in 1776 to proclaim the inherent rights of men, including the right to reform or abolish \\"inadequate\\" government. It influenced a number of later documents, including the United States Declaration of Independence (1776) and the United States Bill of Rights (1789). - The Bill of Rights is an Act of the Parliament of England that deals with constitutional matters and sets out certain basic civil rights. Passed on 16 December 1689, it is a restatement in statutory form of the Declaration of Rights presented by the Convention Parliament to William and Mary in February 1689, inviting them to become joint sovereigns of England. The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the monarch and sets out the rights of Parliament, including the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, and freedom of speech in Parliament. It sets out certain rights of individuals including the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and reestablished the liberty of Protestants to have arms for their defence within the rule of law. Furthermore, the Bill of Rights described and condemned several misdeeds of James II of England. - The Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen newly independent sovereign states, and no longer under British rule. Instead they formed a new nationthe United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was passed on July 2 with no opposing vote cast. A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence. The term \\"Declaration of Independence\\" is not used in the document itself.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea.

Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941) was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. He was the eldest grandchild of the Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and related to many monarchs and princes of Europe, most notably King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Acceding to the throne in 1888, he dismissed the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890. He also launched Germany on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" in foreign affairs that culminated in his support for Austria-Hungary in the crisis of July 1914 that led in a matter of days to the First World War. The impetuous young Kaiser, says John C. G. Rohl, rejected Bismarck's \\"peaceful foreign policy\\" and instead plotted with senior generals to work \\"in favour of a war of aggression.\\" Bismarck told an aide, \\"That young man wants war with Russia, and would like to draw his sword straight away if he could. I shall not be a party to it.\\" Bismarck, after gaining an absolute majority in favour of his policies in the Reichstag, decided to make the anti-Socialist laws permanent. His Kartell, the majority of the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, favoured making the laws permanent, with one exception: the police power to expel Socialist agitators from their homes. The Kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed. As the debate continued, Wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in 1889. He routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear where he stood on social policy. Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's policy and worked to circumvent it. Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young Emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the German Constitution. The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority, with his Kartell voted from power due to the anti-Socialist bill fiasco. The remaining powers in the Reichstag were the Catholic Centre Party and the Conservative Party. Bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the Centre Party, and invited Ludwig Windthorst, the party's parliamentary leader, to discuss a coalition. Wilhelm was furious to hear about Windthorst's visit. In a parliamentary state, the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority, but in Germany, the Chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the Emperor, and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers' meeting. After a heated argument at Bismarck's estate over Imperial authority, Wilhelm stormed out. Bismarck, forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm's interference in foreign and domestic policy, which was published only after Bismarck's death. Although Bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation, by 1889-90, he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations. Moreover, the Kartell, the shifting political coalition that Bismarck had been able to forge since 1867, had lost a working majority in the Reichstag. At the opening of the Reichstag on 6 May 1890, the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer. In 1891, the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations.","response":"This text is about Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Gujarati language and a corresponding English translation of the Gujarati sentence.

Ensuring that the Russian military and the United States-led coalition, which is carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State, “deconflict” and avoid running into each other is only part of the problem: The Obama administration and the Kremlin do not appear to agree even on the main reason for the conflict. American officials, who have long cast Mr. Assad as the primary source of instability in Syria, assert that the Syrian leader’s brutal crackdown provided an opening for jihadist groups and that the crisis cannot be resolved until a political transition is negotiated that requires him to leave power. But Russian officials see the Syrian government as a bulwark against further gains by groups like Islamic State and Nusra Front and sometimes suggest that the defeat of the Islamic State should come before a negotiated solution for the Syrian conflict. Image Secretary of State John Kerry and Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, met Sunday amid tensions between the countries. Credit Dominick Reuter/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Even as the United States has banked on a diplomatic strategy of trying to enlist Russia’s cooperation in Syria, the Kremlin has continued to jolt the White House with its unilateral military and political moves. “This is not yet coordinated,” Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday at the start of a meeting in New York with Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister. “Our presidents will be meeting tomorrow. This is the beginning of a genuine effort to see if there is a way to deconflict, but also to find a way forward that will be effective in keeping a united, secular Syria that can be at peace and stable again without foreign troops present, and that’s our hope.” Robert S. Ford, the former American ambassador to Syria, said that Russian officials have long said they are not wedded to Mr. Assad but have insisted his government is legitimate and rebuffed efforts to impose a successor. ||||| The following is a script from \\"Putin\\" which aired on September 27, 2015. Charlie Rose is the correspondent. Andy Court, producer. There aren't many world leaders who have generated as much interest as Russia's Vladimir Putin. All eyes will be on Putin when he speaks at the U.N. tomorrow and meets with President Obama, at a time when he has placed himself and his country in the middle of the most pressing issues of our times. He helped the U.S. and its Western allies broker the nuclear deal with Iran, and now, with a Russian buildup of aircraft, military equipment and personnel in Syria, he has put himself and his country at the center of that civil war and the fight against ISIS. CBS News Now, when his relations with the United States seem to be at a post-Cold War low, suffering under Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia, Putin may be looking for a way to restore his international influence and gain the respect he seeks for his homeland. Just before his trip to the U.S., Putin invited us to meet him at his state residence outside Moscow where we found him characteristically confident and combative as he made the case that the focus in Syria should be on fighting ISIS rather than removing Syrian President Assad. Charlie Rose: So you would like to join the United States in the fight against ISIS? That's part of why you're there. Others think that while that may be part of your goal, you're trying to save the Assad administration because they've been losing ground and the war has not been going well for them. And you're there to rescue them. President Putin: Well, you're right. We support the legitimate government of Syria. And it's my deep belief that any actions to the contrary in order to destroy the legitimate government will create a situation which you can witness now in the other countries of the region or in other regions, for instance in Libya where all the state institutions are disintegrated. We see a similar situation in Iraq. And there is no other solution to the Syrian crisis than strengthening the effective government structures and rendering them help in fighting terrorism. But, at the same time, urging them to engage in positive dialogue with the rational opposition and conduct reform. Charlie Rose: As you know some of the coalition partners want to see President Assad go first before they will support. President Putin: I'd like to recommend to them the following. They should send this message to the Syrian people. It's only the Syrian people who are entitled to decide who should govern their country and how. Charlie Rose: President Assad, you support him. Do you support what he is doing in Syria and what is happening to those Syrian people, those many millions of refugees and the hundreds of thousands of people that have been killed, many by his own force? President Putin: Well, tell me, what do you think about those who support the opposition and mainly the terrorist organizations only in order to oust Assad without thinking about what will happen to the country after all the government institutions have been demolished? Today, you have repeatedly said that Assad is fighting against his own population. But look at those who are in control of 60 percent of the territory in Syria. It's controlled by either ISIS or by others-- Charlie Rose: Al-Nusra? President Putin: --such as al-Nusra and other terrorist organizations. They are recognized as terrorist organizations by the United States, by other states and by the United Nations. Charlie Rose: Are you prepared to put Russian combat troops on the ground in Syria if it's necessary to defeat ISIS? President Putin: Russia will not participate in any troop operations in the territory of Syria or in any other states. Well, at least we don't plan on it right now. But we are considering intensifying our work with both President Assad and with our partners in other countries. Charlie Rose: I come back to the problem that many people look at. And they believe that Assad helps ISIS. That his reprehensible conduct against the Syrian people using barrel bombs and worse is a recruiting tool for ISIS and that if he was removed, transitioned, at some point, it would be better in the fight against ISIS, al-Nusra and others. President Putin: Well, speaking in a professional language of intelligence services I can tell you that this kind of assessment is an \\"active measure\\" by enemies of Assad. It is anti-Syrian propaganda. Charlie Rose: Much is being read into this including this, that this is a new effort for Russia to take a leadership role in the Middle East and that it represents a new strategy by you. Is it? President Putin: Not really. No. More than 2,000 fighters from Russia and Ex-Soviet Republics are in the territory of Syria. There is a threat of their return to us. So instead of waiting for their return, we are better off helping Assad fight them on Syrian territory. So this is the most important thing which encourages us and pushes us to provide assistance to Assad. And, in general, we want the situation in the region to stabilize. Charlie Rose: But your pride in Russia means that you would like to see Russia play a bigger role in the world and this is just one example. President Putin: Well, it's not the goal in itself. I'm proud of Russia, that's true. And we have something to be proud of, but we do not have any obsession with being a superpower in the international arena. Charlie Rose: But you are in part a major power because of the nuclear weapons you have. You are a force to be reckoned with. President Putin: I hope so. I definitely hope so. Otherwise why do we have nuclear weapons at all? Recent tension between the United States and Russia began after Ukraine's president Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia. Putin responded by annexing Crimea, leading the U.S. and Western allies to impose tough economic sanctions against Russia. President Putin: Ukraine is a separate and major issue for us. It is our closest neighbor. We've always said that this is our sister country. It's not only a Slavic people. We have common history, common culture, common religion, and many things in common. What I believe is absolutely unacceptable is the resolution of internal political issues in the former USSR Republics, through \\"color revolutions,\\" through coup d'états, through unconstitutional removal of power. That is totally unacceptable. Our partners in the United States have supported those who ousted Yanukovych. Charlie Rose: You believe that the United States had something to do with the ousting of Yanukovych, and he had to flee to Russia. President Putin: I know that for sure. Charlie Rose: How do you know that for sure? President Putin: I know those people who live in Ukraine. We have thousands of contacts with them. We know who and where, when, who exactly met with someone and worked with those who ousted Yanukovych, how they were supported, how much they were paid, how they were trained, where, in which countries, and who those instructors were. We know everything. For the record, the U.S. government has denied any involvement in the removal of the Ukrainian leader. Charlie Rose: You respect the sovereignty of Ukraine? President Putin: Sure. But we want countries to respect the sovereignty of other countries and Ukraine in particular. Respect for sovereignty means to not allow unconstitutional action and coup d'états, the removal of legitimate power. Charlie Rose: How will the renewal of legitimate power take place in your judgment? How will that come about? And what role will Russia play? President Putin: Russia has not taken part and is not going to take part in any actions aimed at removing the legitimate government. Charlie Rose: You have a military presence on the border of Ukraine. And some even argue that there have been Russian troops in Ukraine. President Putin: Well, you do have a military presence in Europe? Charlie Rose: Yes. President Putin: American tactical nuclear weapons are in Europe. Let's not forget that. What does this mean? Does it mean that you've occupied Germany or that you've transformed the occupation forces into NATO forces? And if we have our military forces on our territory, on the border with some state, you believe this is a crime? What Vladimir Putin thinks about America and about President Obama might surprise you. That, and some insights into his personality, when we come back. President Putin, part two Vladimir Putin has wielded power in Russia for more than 15 years, longer than many czars. He has not only reshaped his own country, but has begun to play a larger role in international affairs, as an occasional ally, but more often foe of U.S. policy. Presidential candidates have portrayed him as a bully, a gangster or pragmatic opponent who can be bargained with. One thing we found: a strong personality who will engage in a conversation with blunt talk, charm and wit. Charlie Rose: You're much talked about in America. There's much conversation. More so than any-- President Putin: Maybe they have nothing else to do in America but to talk about me. Charlie Rose: No, no, or maybe they're curious people. Or maybe you're an interesting character. Maybe that's what it is. They know of a former KGB agent who came back and got into politics in St. Petersburg and became deputy mayor and then came to Moscow. And the interesting thing is they see these images of you bare-chested on a horse. And they say, \\"There is a man who carefully cultivates his image of strength.\\" President Putin: You know, I'm convinced that a person in my position must provide a positive example to people. And those areas where he can do this, he must do this. Charlie Rose: You enjoy the work, you enjoy representing Russia and you know-- you've been an intelligence officer. Intelligence officers know how to read other people. That's part of the job, yes? Yes? President Putin: It used to be. Used to be. Now I have a different job and that's been for quite a long time. Charlie Rose: Somebody in Russia told me there is no such thing as a former KGB man. Once a KGB man, always a KGB man. President Putin: Well, you know, anything that we do, all this knowledge we acquire, all the experience, we'll have it forever and we'll keep that. And we'll use it somehow. So, in this sense, yes. They're right. Charlie Rose: A CIA operative once said to me that one of the training you have is you learn the capacity to be liked as well because you have to charm people. You have to charm people, you have to, yes, seduce them. Let me-- President Putin: Well, if the CIA told you then that's the way it is because they are an expert on that. Charlie Rose: You have a popularity rating in Russia that would make every politician in the world envious. Why are you so popular? President Putin: There is something that I have in common with everycitizen of Russia, the love for our motherland. Charlie Rose: Many of us were moved by an emotional moment at the time of the World War II memory because of the sacrifices Russia had made. And you were seen with a picture of your father with tears in your eyes. President Putin: My family suffered very major losses during the Second World War, that's true. In my father's family, there were five brothers. I think four of them died. On my mother's side the picture was pretty much the same. Russia has suffered great losses. And of course we can't forget that. And we must not forget that. Not to put blame on somebody, but to prevent anything like this from happening in the future. Charlie Rose: You also have said that the worst thing to happen in the last century was the collapse of the Soviet empire. There are those who look at Ukraine, especially Ukraine and Georgia, and they believe that you do not want to recreate the Soviet empire, but you do want to recreate a sphere of influence, which you think Russia deserves because of the relationship that has existed. Why are you smiling? Why? President Putin: You're makingme happy, because we're always suspected of some ambitions. And they always try to distort something. I indeed said that I believe that the collapse of the USSR was a huge tragedy of the 20th century. You know why? Charlie Rose: Why? President Putin: Because, first of all, in an instant 25 million Russian people found themselves beyond the borders of the Russian state, although they were living within the borders of the Soviet Union. Then, all of a sudden, the USSR collapsed -- just overnight, in fact. And it's turned out that in the former Soviet Republics -- 25 million Russian people were living. They were living in a single country. And all of a sudden, they turned out to be outside the borders of the country. You see this is a huge problem. First of all, there were everyday problems, the separation of families, social problems, economic problems. You can't list them all. Do you think it's normal that 25 million Russian people were abroad all of a sudden? Russia was the biggest divided nation in the world. It's not a problem? Well, maybe not for you. But it's a problem for me. Charlie Rose: There are many people who are critical of Russia, as you know. They say that it's more autocratic and less democratic. They say that political opponents and journalists have been killed and imprisoned in Russia. They say your power is unchallenged. And they say that power and absolute power corrupts absolutely. What do you say to those people who worry about the climate, the atmosphere in Russia? President Putin: Well, there can be no democracy whatsoever without compliance with the law. Everyone must observe the laws. This is the most important thing which we must bear in mind. As for these tragic events, such as the death of people, including journalists, unfortunately they do occur in all countries of the world. But if they happen in our country, we do the utmost to find the criminals and to punish them. But the most important thing is that we will continue to improve our political system so that every citizen can feel that they do influence the life of the city, of the country and of the society and so that the authorities will feel responsible with regard to those people who trust them during election campaigns. Charlie Rose: If you, as a leader of this country, insist that the rule of law be adhered to, if you insist that justice be done, if you because of your power, then it could go a long way to eliminating that perception. President Putin: Well, a lot can be done. But not everyone succeeds with everything from the very start. How long did it take the democratic process to develop in the United States? Do you believe that everything is perfect now from the point of view of democracy in the United States? If everything was perfect there wouldn't be the problem of Ferguson. There would be no abuse by the police. But our task is to see all these problems and to respond properly. Charlie Rose: So the people who killed Nemtsov will be prosecuted to the fullest? President Putin: Yes. I said it right away that this is a shame for our history and criminals must be prosecuted and punished. Charlie Rose: Are you curious about America? More than simply another nation that you have to deal with? President Putin: Of course we are curious about what's going on. America exerts enormous influence on the situation in the world, as a whole. Charlie Rose: What do you admire most about America? President Putin: I like the creativity. Charlie Rose: Creativity? President Putin: Creativity when it comes to your tackling problems. Their openness, openness and open-mindedness. Because it allows them to unleash the inner potential of their people. And thanks to that, America has attained such amazing results in developing their country. |||||","response":"Russia's moves in Syria are causing issues for the Obama administration, which remains deeply conflicted regarding American military involvement in the Syrian conflict.

Hooked as much on one another as they are on the drug, their relationship is alternating states of oblivion, self-destruction, and despair. The film is organized in 3 acts of roughly 3 scenes each, titled Heaven, Earth, and Hell: In Heaven, the young lovers ecstatically experience sex and drugs. Constantly seeking drug money, they borrow from Candy's parents or eccentric university professor Casper (Geoffrey Rush), selling things, stealing, even prostituting when desperate. In Earth they are married and confront the realities of addiction and family life. Dan purchases the drugs; Candy becomes a prostitute. Dan steals a credit card and gets the owner's PIN, then steals money from his bank funds. Candy becomes pregnant, and despite their efforts to \\"go clean\\", the baby is delivered stillborn at 23 weeks. They finally stop taking drugs with huge effort, going through agonizing withdrawal symptoms in the process. Despite poor living conditions, constant struggles for money, and frequent disputes, they love each other very much. In Hell they experience the dissolution of their relationship and recovery. They choose to move to the country to \\"try methadone\\" as a way to ease into a more normal life.

For example, the problem of factoring - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time . - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\" - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

Police Scotland's corporate services director, David Page, also acknowledged it operated under \\"budgetary pressures\\". Mr Steele, SPF general secretary, was speaking at a fringe meeting at the SNP conference in Glasgow, during which he showed a series of photographs to the audience. He said there had been \\"decades of failures to invest\\" in infrastructure. He also claimed police boards that ran the eight forces which merged to form Police Scotland had \\"made a pig's ear of looking after the things they were charged with looking after\\". Mr Steele said: \\"Decades of failures cannot be afforded to be left unchecked at this point of time, because if we do we will have a service that rather than delivering excellence can only ever aspire to mediocrity, and I don't think that's going to be good enough.\\" He claimed officers were fighting 21st-century crime with technology that was developed in the 1990s. He cited the use of old versions of the Windows operating system - which are no longer supported by Microsoft - on force computers. Day-to-day spending at Police Scotland on expenses such as staffing is expected to be Â£21m over budget by the end of 2016-17, he said. Mr Steele continued: \\"Police officers are doing a hell of a job under very, very difficult circumstances, the scale of the financial challenge facing the police service is enormous.\\" He showed pictures that he said came from inside police buildings and a photo of a car being used by officers. \\"We have a crisis, a genuine crisis, coming round the corner as far as our facilities are concerned,\\" he said. He said an interview suite used to question victims of sex crimes who have undergone a \\"harrowing ordeal\\" has mould on the carpets as well as damp on the ceilings, water coming in and \\"absolutely stinks of damp\\". \\"That's the kind of facilities we, through no fault of our own, are bringing victims of crime.

The Justice Secretary, Michael Matheson, agrees that there is not enough funding, but says there is a plan to try and fix the problems.

It is said that the cliff holds a mysterious power that binds the entire town's fate. For generations, the townsfolk have lived peacefully, never daring to venture into the cave, believing that uncovering its secrets would unleash an unspeakable evil upon their land. Our protagonist, Alice, a young and fearless dreamer, struggles to live up to the expectations of her traditional family and her village. She's always been fascinated by the tales of the hidden cliff and all that it symbolizes. The more she tries to resist her curiosity, the stronger it grows, persuading her to go on a quest to uncover the truth behind the ancient legend. As the story unfolds, Alice rallies her band of unlikely heroes: her childhood friend, Sebastian, a brilliant but timid mapmaker; Luna, a rebellious huntress with unparalleled tracking skills; and Thomas, a mystical figure with the ability to speak to the spirits of nature. Together, they embark on a treacherous journey, facing trials that test their unity, strength, and resilience. Along their path, they encounter mythical creatures and mystical beings, learning valuable lessons about faith, courage, and the fragility of life. As they navigate through treacherous terrain and face challenging puzzles, they realize that their destinies have been intertwined since birth and that each of them possesses unique abilities that complement one another. As they venture deeper into The Wailing Hollows, the group stumbles upon the remains of a lost civilization that hints at an even greater mystery surrounding the cliff. This discovery urges them to acknowledge the complexity and depth of the legend, doubting the version that has been passed down for generations in Seraphim's Cove. Finally, after surpassing an array of challenges, Alice and her friends stumble upon the hidden cliff inside the cave. The cliff itself is a breathtaking, colossal structure covered with ancient runes that hum with magical energy. At the edge of the cliff, Alice finds a mystical stone that, when touched, unveils a powerful vision of the town's true history. The vision reveals that, centuries ago, the cliff was the primary source of magical energy for a benevolent race known as the Etherians. However, a great calamity struck that weakened the source of energy within the cliff, causing the Etherians to be on the brink of extinction. The Etherians knew that, in time, the cliff's power would diminish, and only a chosen few with pure hearts and strong spirits would be able to restore it. In an emotional climax, Alice realizes that her curiosity and dreams were not coincidences, but signs that she is one of the chosen ones mentioned in the vision. The group unites their newfound abilities and restores the power within the cliff. Their selfless act resurrects the Etherians, who grant them their heartfelt gratitude and eternal friendship. Ali and her friends journey back to Seraphim's Cove, changed forever. They assure the townsfolk that the hidden cliff is not a threat, but a symbol of hope and balance, teaching them that, in order to grow stronger, they must be willing to explore the unknown and embrace the wonders that lie deep within their own souls. The movie ends with the mythical cliff still standing strong as a homage and reminder to the people of Seraphim's Cove of what it means to dream, to believe, and to embrace the inexhaustible power of unity and hope."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Such a state, with a constitution and identical rights for all citizens, could guarantee long-term security in a way that the current fake peace doesn't.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The state that is referenced is Georgia.\\" true?

Amazon recently raised the pressure on UK supermarkets with the launch of same-day deliveries in London. The online retail giant signed a deal with Morrisons and now sells 130,000 products, including fresh goods. Sainsbury's stores in London's Streatham Common, Richmond and Brookwood in Surrey will try out the service which will allow people who order their shopping by 12.00pm to receive their goods within six hours. At present, customers have to order the day before to receive their shopping. Britain's second largest supermarket group said: \\"Assuming the trials are successful, same-day online grocery delivery will be available in 30 stores by Christmas.\\" The UK retail sector has been under growing pressure to retain and build customer numbers as more shoppers have turned to discount supermarket chains Lidl and Aldi. Recent figures from analysts Kantar Worldpanel showed that total supermarket sales fell in the three months to 19 June. The combined market share of Aldi and Lidl hit a record high of 10.5% with both reporting rising sales. In contrast, the big four - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - all reported falling sales during the period. The online grocery business is forecast to be worth Â£9.8bn by the end of this year, according to market analyst Mintel, and could grow to Â£15bn by 2020. Sainsbury's is hoping a new distribution centre in Bromley-by-Bow in east London will help \\"enable its customers to shop whenever and wherever they want and will cater for the growing demand in the capital for Sainsbury's online groceries service\\".

They are doing this because another big store, Amazon, started doing same-day deliveries in London, and they want to compete with them.

However, given the options you provided, I will discuss each one below: 1. Frightened: It is less likely that repeatedly viewing an artifact would cause one to feel frightened, unless there is a specific traumatic experience or association with the object that would trigger anxiety or fear. 2. Painful memories: If the artifact is connected to a negative or painful memory or event from the individual's past, repeated exposure to it may evoke those painful memories, such as feelings of loss, regret, or grief. 3. Pleasure: On the other hand, if the artifact has a positive association, viewing it might bring about feelings of pleasure or happiness. This could be through emotional connections, personal value placed on the item, or the aesthetic appeal of the artifact. 4. Learning: Regardless of whether someone has seen the artifact multiple times, there can always be new aspects to discover or fresh perspectives to consider. Viewing an artifact repeatedly may provide an opportunity for a deeper understanding of its history, significance, or artistic qualities. 5. Thinking \\"Hmm, let me think\\": Lastly, seeing an artifact multiple times might prompt one to stop and contemplate the object or its connection with their own life or history.

Both sentences mention the federal arrest warrant, a sealed complaint in New York, and a federal defender in California making this statement on Friday. However, there are nuanced differences between the two sentences that change their meaning slightly: 1. The first sentence simply states that the computer hacker is \\"nationally known,\\" while the second sentence adds the extra detail of the hacker being \\"itinerant\\" or wandering. This gives a slightly different context to the hacker's behavior and reputation. 2. In the first sentence, the hacker is being \\"sought\\" on a federal arrest warrant, which implies that authorities are currently searching or pursuing the individual in question, but may not have located or arrested them yet. In the second sentence, the phrasing simply states that the hacker \\"faces a federal arrest warrant\\" without explicitly stating whether or not the person is currently being sought or pursued. 3. The first sentence directly mentions that the information is coming from a \\"federal defender in California,\\" while the second sentence introduces the information with \\"SACRAMENTO,\\" a geographical location in California. Both sentences imply the information comes from California, but the first sentence explicitly states the source as a federal defender, while the second sentence relies on the geographical context to convey the source.

Article: Scores on a national test released on November 1 show that students in the U.S.A. have improved in math over the last two years, but mostly stayed the same in reading. This year, 422,000 fourth graders and 343,000 eighth graders took the exams between January and March. Students were asked to read grade-appropriate materials and answer questions for the reading test. For the math test, students answered questions about geometry, algebra, number properties, measurement and other topics. The U.S Department of Education released the scores in a report called The Nation's Report Card (NAEP). This year, students earned the highest scores ever recorded on the math exam, which has been given since 1990.Fourth graders scored an average of 241.That is a one-point increase from 2009and a 28-point increase from 1990. Eighth graders made similar progress. Then average score this year was 284,up one point from 2009 and 21 points from 1990. In reading, fourth graders scored an average of 221 points, the same average score since 2007.That score is four points above those from 1992, when the first reading test was given. Eighth graders scored an average of 265 points, up one point from 2009 and five points from 1992. Education experts say reading is a harder subject to improve in the classroom than math. While math is largely learned in classrooms, reading results depend on how much kids read outside of school and how much they read in other subjects, such as history and science. On the NAEP, math scores were the highest among students who have limited use of calculators during math lessons, compared with students who have unlimited use or no use. Reading scores were the highest among students who said they read for fun on their own time almost every day.

This can be determined from the information provided in the article, which states that fourth graders scored an average of 241 in the most recent test, which is a 28-point increase from 1990. Therefore, subtracting 28 points from the current score of 241 gives us the 1990 average score: 241 - 28 = 213."},{"question":"La Turquie estime également qu'il ne faut pas négliger les volets syrien et libanais.

Born in Boston, she studied at Smith College and Newnham College at the University of Cambridge before receiving acclaim as a poet and writer. She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, before separating in 1962. As Hughes and Plath were legally married at the time of her death, Hughes inherited the Plath estate, including all her written work. Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he \\"did not want her children to have to read it.\\" He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013. Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas. Still the subject of speculation and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 poems about his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book went on to win the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life. In October 2015 the BBC Two documentary Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death examined Hughes' life and work and included audio recordings of Plath reciting her own poetry. Their daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her mother and father. In 2017 it was revealed that letters written by Plath between February 18, 1960 and February 4, 1963 claim that Hughes beat Plath two days before she had a miscarriage in 1961, and that Hughes told Plath he wished that she was dead. The letters were sent to Dr. Ruth Barnhouse (then Dr. Ruth Beuscher). Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did Hughes have any other issues going on in his life?","response":"Yes, Hughes had other issues going on in his life. According to the information provided, it was not known at the release of the book \\"Birthday Letters\\" that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer. The book, which contains 88 poems about his relationship with Plath, was published in 1998, and Hughes died later that year.

Sentence 2: Once you identify the critical processes, the company can perform studies to make sure they meet the accounting specifications. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, but with slight differences in focus and specificity. Both sentences discuss the essential idea that companies need to ensure their critical processes meet certain specifications. In more detail, the first sentence emphasizes that companies identify critical processes and then perform capability studies to ensure that these processes will produce parts that meet specifications. This statement suggests an emphasis on manufacturing processes, as it refers to the production of parts. On the other hand, the second sentence is more general in its approach. It states that once you identify the critical processes, the company can perform studies to make sure they meet the accounting specifications. Here, the focus is on accounting specifications, which broadens the scope of the statement. Although the first sentence did not specifically mention accounting, it can be understood that the term \\"specifications\\" in that sentence could include accounting specifications as well. In summary, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence because both express the idea that companies need to ensure their critical processes meet specifications, with slight differences in detail and emphasis."},{"question":"Question: Information: - The Sidecar TT is a motorcycle-with-sidecar road race competition held over two legs which takes place during the Isle of Man TT festival, an annual event at the end of May and beginning of June.

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years.

The team played at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, county, and state governments sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play at the Kingdome in 1977. The Mariners struggled in the stadium and moved to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite having Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs—the longest active postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions.

The controversial casting call document, published Wednesday by the celebrity gossip site TMZ, \\"pulls back the curtain\\" on the widely known practice of casting based on skin tone in Hollywood, a longtime manager said. TMZ reported that it got the audition posting from \\"an African-American actor who didn't fit the profile, and who's pissed.\\" The role was for an \\"African-American Car Dealer\\" who would appear in a car showroom scene with Jerry Seinfeld. Jay Leno also appeared in the ad. The sheet's \\"role details\\" read: \\"Nice Looking, friendly. Not too dark.

Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field. Guess a valid title for it!

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - A category of fine art, graphic art covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface. The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on color, especially drawing and the various forms of engraving; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to printmaking processes, such as line engraving, aquatint, drypoint, etching, mezzotint, monotype, lithography, and screen printing (silk-screen, serigraphy). Graphic art further includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs. - Philip Edward \\"Phil\\" Hartman (September 24, 1948May 28, 1998; born Hartmann) was a Canadian-American actor, voice actor, comedian, screenwriter and graphic artist. Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family moved to the United States in 1958. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like Poco and America. Feeling the need for a more creative outlet, Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film \\"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\\" and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show \\"Pee-wee's Playhouse\\". - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor. - Houseguest is a 1995 comedy film starring Sinbad and Phil Hartman and directed by Randall Miller .

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk?

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

Article: Scientists in Colombia have trained a team of rats to help remove land mines from the countryside. Land mines are small bombs hidden in the ground and designed to explode when someone steps on them. When trained, the rats can smell special metals in the mines and then signal to their human team. Then why use rats for such an important job? In the past, dogs have been used to find bombs. Rats have a good sense of smell and can respond to orders, just like dogs do. But rats are much lighter than dogs. They stand less of a chance of setting off the mines, which explode under a certain amount of weight. What's more, the best rats are cheaper to keep than dogs. It costs about the same amount of money to take care of one dog as it does 70 rats. The rats have already been used in Tanzania, an African country with many land mines. Luisa Fernanda Mendez and her team in Colombia are training the even lighter Wistar rats. These are the white rats with red eyes that scientists often use in laboratory experiments. \\" _ even train their babies to perform their jobs, which saves us a lot of time, \\" Mendez said. Colombia has the second-highest rate of deaths from land mine accidents in the world. Last year, land mines killed 695 people -- 56 of whom were children. A criminal group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as other organizations, have placed the mines. FARC are strongly against Colombia's government. The group has placed mines all around its own bases and in many places in the countryside. In the past, the Colombian government hired peasants and poor farmers to find mines. Many of them died trying to find the well-hidden bombs. Colombian police official Erick Guzman hopes the team of rats can come to the rescue . \\"These rats will be a great help,\\" he said.

Typically, psychologists must have completed a university degree in psychology, which is a master's degree in some countries and a doctorate in others. This definition of psychologist is non-exclusive; in most jurisdictions, members of other professions (such as counselors and psychiatrists) can also evaluate, diagnose, treat, and study mental processes. Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research and provide consultation services. - The central nervous system (CNS) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord. The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from, and coordinates and influences the activity of all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animalsthat is, all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfishand it contains the majority of the nervous system. Many consider the retina and the optic nerve (2nd cranial nerve), as well as the olfactory nerves (1st) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS, synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia. Following this classification the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment, which opens up for therapeutic treatments. - Psychotherapy is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills. Certain psychotherapies are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders. - Arthur Janov (born August 21, 1924) is an American psychologist, psychotherapist, and the creator of primal therapy, a treatment for mental illness that involves repeatedly descending into, feeling, and experiencing long-repressed childhood pain. Janov directs a psychotherapy institute called the Primal Center in Santa Monica, California. Janov is the author of many books, most notably \\"The Primal Scream\\" (1970). - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. - The Primal Scream .

The Census Bureau population for Santa Monica in 2010 was 89,736. - Primal therapy is a trauma-based psychotherapy created by Arthur Janov, who argues that neurosis is caused by the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argues that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness and resolved through re-experiencing the incident and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. In therapy, the patient recalls and reenacts a particularly disturbing past experience usually occurring early in life and expresses normally repressed anger or frustration especially through spontaneous and unrestrained screams, hysteria, or violence. Primal therapy was developed as a means of eliciting the repressed pain; the term \\"Pain\\" is capitalized in discussions of primal therapy when referring to any repressed emotional distress and its purported long-lasting psychological effects. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the source of Pain within the more basic parts of the central nervous system.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who deeply cares for Rebecca? Movie title: Womb Movie plot: The film commences with a pregnant woman (Eva Green) telling her unborn child that the father has departed for good, but that together they will start a new life. A love story is then told between two children, Rebecca and Tommy, who swear each other eternal love. When Rebecca departs suddenly for Japan with her mother, the two are separated. Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship. Tommy is a political activist fighting against the biotech corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by cloning. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches. Rebecca, herself a computer programmer of leak detection sonar software for underground storage containers, insists on accompanying Tommy. Driving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle. Rebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and gives birth to a new Tommy by Caesarean section. Tommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship. Rebecca presents to him a pleo, an artificial living animal created using new biotechnology. Tommy and his playmates observe a neighbourhood girl and try to determine if she has a \\"copy smell\\" as the girl is a clone. The neighbourhood mothers display prejudice against \\"copies\\", expecting Rebecca to not let Tommy associate with them. Rebecca,... A:","response":"In the movie \\"Womb,\\" there are several characters who deeply care for Rebecca (played by Eva Green). 1. Tommy (played by Matt Smith) - Tommy is the childhood friend and later love interest of Rebecca. They swear eternal love to each other as children, and when Rebecca returns to find Tommy 12 years later, he still remembers and cares deeply for her. Their relationship is reignited, and they continue to be close until his sudden death. After his death, Rebecca's love for Tommy drives her to have him cloned and bring him back to life, raising the cloned Tommy as her son. 2. Rebecca's mother - While it is not explicitly stated in the provided plot summary, we can assume that Rebecca's mother cares deeply for her daughter. Rebecca's mother had taken her away to Japan, separating Rebecca and Tommy for 12 years, likely to provide Rebecca with new opportunities and experiences. It can be inferred that Rebecca's mother has her best interests at heart and wants her to succeed in life. 3. Tommy's parents - After Tommy's death, it is clear that his parents care for Rebecca: they grieve with her over their shared loss, and Tommy's father provides her with Tommy's cell material when she expresses her desire to have Tommy cloned. Even though Tommy's mother objects initially, she likely understands Rebecca's pain and grief as they all struggle to cope with Tommy's death. 4. The cloned Tommy - The cloned version of Tommy, who is raised as Rebecca's son, also deeply cares for her. Their relationship is close, and since he is a clone of the original Tommy, it's reasonable to assume that some of the feelings the original Tommy had for Rebecca may be transferred or shared by the clone in some way. This deepens their bond and the importance of their relationship in the film. In conclusion, multiple characters in the movie \\"Womb\\" deeply care for Rebecca. Each relationship has its own complexities and serves to shape Rebecca's experiences and choices throughout the film. Considering the depth and intensity of these relationships, investing in this film proposal may be worth it if you value thought-provoking dramas that explore strong emotional bonds and the consequences of one's actions."},{"question":"Here is a news article: A jury found St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez not guilty Friday in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile, whose livestreamed death during a traffic stop stunned a nation. Castile’s family called the decision proof of a dysfunctional criminal justice system, while prosecutors cautioned the public to respect the jury’s verdict “because that is the fundamental premise of the rule of law.” “I am so disappointed in the state of Minnesota,” Castile’s mother, Valerie Castile, said at a news conference shortly after the verdict was read in court about 2:45 p.m. “My son loved this state. He had one tattoo on his body and it was of the Twin Cities — the state of Minnesota with TC on it. My son loved this city and this city killed my son. And the murderer gets away.” Hours later, at the tail end of a protest march through the streets of St. Paul, hundreds of people headed out on Interstate 94 at Dale, shutting down the freeway. Over the course of about an hour, the crowd thinned out and was moved to a ramp near Marion before State Patrol officers moved in after 12:30 a.m. Saturday and began making 18 arrests. Among those arrested were reporters Susan Du of City Pages and David Clarey of the Minnesota Daily, who were covering the protest. The decision came on the last day of a three-week trial in a case that had been closely watched ever since Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, livestreamed the brutal aftermath on Facebook. The jury of five women and seven men reached its verdict after about 30 hours of deliberations over five days. They appeared stalled Wednesday, and were called into the courtroom and asked to continue deliberations. Juror Dennis Ploussard said the jury was deadlocked 10 for acquittal, two for conviction until Friday afternoon. “This was very, very difficult for all of us,” Ploussard said Friday afternoon in an interview at his home. “This was a very, very trying case.” Ploussard declined to identify the holdouts but said they were not the two people of color on the jury. Defense attorney Earl Gray leaned over and squeezed Yanez’s shoulders after the first not guilty verdict was read for the manslaughter charge. After the last two not guilty verdicts were read for reckless discharge of a firearm, Valerie Castile stood up from the front-row seat she had occupied throughout the trial, yelled an expletive and walked past several deputies, breaking with strict orders issued minutes earlier by Ramsey County District Judge William H. Leary III that no one was to leave until after he ended the hearing. Several of Castile’s supporters cried and filed out after Valerie Castile as about 13 sheriff’s deputies stood watch over the proceeding. “Seven times!” one woman exclaimed, referring to the number of shots Yanez fired into Castile’s car. Five rounds struck Castile; two of them tore through his heart. Jurors showed little reaction while the verdicts were read and were quickly escorted out a private side door. Yanez’s mother cried and hugged Gray before Yanez and his family were whisked away through the same door, eventually leaving in a van that departed from the courthouse’s nonpublic indoor garage. Thomas Kelly, one of Yanez’s attorneys, said his client was vindicated by the jury’s decision. “We’re not celebrating anything here because this was a tragedy and we’re mindful of that,” he said. Shortly afterward, the city of St. Anthony issued a statement on its website saying it would no longer employ Yanez as a police officer. “The City of St. Anthony has concluded that the public will be best served if Officer Yanez is no longer a police officer in our city,” the statement read. “The city intends to offer Officer Yanez a voluntary separation agreement to help him transition to another career.” Kelly said he was unsure of Yanez’s future plans, but acknowledged “it might be difficult” were he to continue his job in St. Anthony. “Because he has such a good reputation within the law enforcement community I’m sure if he wanted to find another department he would not have any difficulty,” Kelly said. Reynolds did not attend the verdict reading, but her attorney, Larry Rogers, said she was “close by” and quickly informed of the verdict. She was devastated, he said. “She lost somebody very important to her,” Rogers said. “Her life was in danger. Her daughter’s life was in danger. And this verdict says that’s OK.” Reynolds, who testified at trial and attended closing arguments Monday, issued a written statement through Rogers’ office saying that Castile was following the officer’s orders to retrieve his driver’s license when he was killed. “I am incredibly disappointed with the jury’s verdict,” Reynolds said. “…It is a sad state of affairs when this type of criminal conduct is condoned simply because Yanez is a policeman. God help America.” Yanez was the first Minnesota police officer in modern history to be charged with shooting and killing a civilian. Eight months before Castile was killed, Jamar Clark, a 23-year-old black man, was fatally shot during a scuffle with two Minneapolis police officers who were not charged. His death sparked weeks of protest in north Minneapolis. Both cases were in a wave of high-profile police shootings of black men that created unrest across the country. Yanez, 29, was acquitted of felony manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm for killing Castile, 32, July 6 in Falcon Heights, and endangering his passengers, Rey­nolds, and her daughter, then 4. Reynolds’ Facebook Live video of Castile’s death captured worldwide attention. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety and Ramsey County Attorney John Choi’s office declined Friday to release squad dashcam footage of the shooting but said it could be available within a week. The U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Minnesota, which designated federal prosecutor Jeffrey Paulsen to assist with the case, issued a statement Friday saying they are “assessing whether any additional federal review is justified.” Prosecutors argued that Yanez, who is Mexican-American, racially profiled Castile, a black man, when he stopped him for a nonworking brake light. Yanez testified that he also wanted to investigate whether Castile was a suspect in the armed robbery of a nearby convenience store four days earlier. Castile was never connected to the robbery. Defense attorneys argued that Castile was culpably negligent in the shooting because he volunteered that he possessed a gun without disclosing that he had a permit to carry it, that he reached for it instead of keeping his hands visible, and that he was high on marijuana, rendering him incapable of following Yanez’s order not to reach for the gun. Yanez testified last week that he fired because he feared for his life. A gun was recovered from Castile’s right front shorts pocket as medics and police prepared to move him onto a backboard. Castile had a permit to carry the handgun. Two hours after the verdict was read, Choi stood alongside the three prosecutors who tried the case: Paulsen, Rick Dusterhoft and Clayton Robinson. Choi said that although he was disappointed with the verdict, it was an integral function of the criminal justice system. “We gave it our best shot, we really did,” Choi said. “We were fighting for the integrity of this process.” Choi urged people to pray for the Castile family. He also tried to shore up any fallout the case may have had with law enforcement, saying that the trial was about one officer’s actions, not an indictment on “law enforcement as a whole.” Choi declined to say whether his prosecutors should have played an hourlong interview Yanez gave to investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) during the state’s case. Prosecutors told jurors at trial that Yanez used “it” several times instead of “gun” or “firearm” in the interview recorded the day after the shooting, proof that he never saw Castile’s gun. But prosecutors didn’t play the audio recording during their three-day case, which is the common practice. They tried unsuccessfully to play it during the defense’s case in an attempt to catch Yanez contradicting himself. Leary denied the move. “I’ll have a chance to maybe address that” in the future, Choi said. “But I don’t really want to get into the play-by-play of going backward with respect to the trial.” Valerie Castile didn’t hold back in her critique of the system, shifting from the calm she displayed throughout the trial to a vociferous display of indignation. “There has always been a systemic problem in the state of Minnesota, and me thinking, common sense that we would get justice,” she said. “But nevertheless the system continues to fail black people.” Hours later, in a Facebook Live video — the same format used to broadcast her son’s death — she let loose.

Eventually, they turned left on Victoria Street, heading south where they crossed an overpass of I-94. The massive group eventually made its way to Dale Street, heading back north at around 10:15 p.m. From there, they walked onto the Dale Street exit of I-94 and made their way onto the highway. At around 10:50 p.m., the group started marching east on the interstate toward police. The State Patrol estimated the group on the highway at about 500 people.

Minnesota State Patrol said it arrested 18 protesters following demonstrations on Interstate 94 in St. Paul. They were arrested after they failed to comply with orders to disperse, the agency posted on Twitter. St. Paul police estimated that 2,000 people marched peacefully through the streets, including a crowd gathered outside the Minnesota state Capitol. Speakers led chants, sang hymns and urged the protesters not to lose hope. Some held signs that read \\"this hurts\\" and \\"Justice not served for Philando.\\" Protests expected By late Friday night, about 500 people chanting \\"Black lives ... they matter here!!\\" marched onto Interstate 94 -- two miles west of the Capitol -- shutting down traffic in both directions. The protests were expected. After officer Jeronimo Yanez fatally shot Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, 2016, demonstrations took place across the nation, partly because the aftermath of the shooting was live-streamed on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend, a passenger in the car. Organizers of the Friday protest said on Facebook , \\"This verdict shows how the system is rigged against justice for victims of police terror.\\" Theresa St. Aoro visits the memorial to place flowers at the site where Philando Castile was shot. 'I was stunned, just stunned' One woman made her feelings known in a smaller, quieter way. Theresa St. Aoro brought flowers Friday to the spot in Falcon Heights, outside Minneapolis, where Castile was shot. It's been a roadside memorial since the day Castile died but it received extra visits Friday. Flowers piled up and a handwritten sign said, \\"I will miss you.\\" A more professionally made sign said, \\"Falcon Heights: The Nation Is Watching.\\" \\"I was stunned, just stunned,\\" St. Aoro said. \\"I don't think that this was a fair jury. It took so long when they couldn't decide. Did they just say, 'Oh, it's Friday and I want to go home?' This was not justice at all.\\" WATCH LIVE: Protesters march through St. Paul following the acquittal of the officer who killed #PhilandoCastile. https://t.co/bWB5JChjdL pic.twitter.com/da7zrHrsEw — WCCO - CBS Minnesota (@WCCO) June 17, 2017 St. Aoro said she believes the jury makeup was wrong from the trial's outset. The jury was composed of eight men and four women, including one black man and one black woman. The jury heard two weeks of testimony and spent about 27 hours deliberating. \\"I don't think this was a fair jury at all, made up of more than half middle-aged white people,\\" she said. Protesters gather outside the state Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota. Numerous groups castigated the decision. Sherrilyn Ifill, the director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said the jury's decision shows how difficult it is to prosecute a police officer in a fatal shooting. \\"This incident seemed so egregious and avoidable that we hoped that this time, it might be different -- that this time, justice might be served,\\" Ifill said. \\"Because if the government can take your life and no one is held responsible, you are a second-class citizen, if not fully dehumanized in the eyes of the law,\\" she said. \\"That is the devastating message this verdict, along with all those similar acquittals before it, sends to communities of color across the nation.\\" The ACLU said in a statement: \\"Two Supreme Court decisions from the 1980s allow officers to use deadly force when a reasonable officer on the scene could reasonably fear for their safety. These two decisions create an atmosphere where police violence is sanctioned based on what we think a hypothetical officer could have felt, even if, in reality, the officer was acting recklessly, had ill motives or was acting based on implicit bias.

He killed somebody. Philando Castile got victimized by the system. So we need to start asking a question about the system -- why is the system violent?\\" Reeves said. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"On June 16, 2017, a jury found St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez not guilty for the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a traffic stop. The aftermath of the shooting had been livestreamed on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, which sparked widespread outrage and led to nationwide protests. Following the verdict, many of Castile's supporters took to the streets of St. Paul to express their disappointment and outrage. A crowd of about 2,000 people marched peacefully and called for justice, but some protesters blocked traffic on Interstate 94, leading to 18 arrests. Critics argue that the predominantly white jury was biased, and the Castile family accuses the criminal justice system of protecting the police officer over the victim due to racial inequality."},{"question":"I knew that 'Evening' was a girlie film, so I was expecting to be bored. A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive. Survive? Yes. I am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! I suppose that, for Yanks, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film. There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die. He ends up a wriggling (why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. This film is also about a sort of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. She's not worried about having been a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagines herself a murderess. Obviously, being a girlie film, there's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy/Heathcliff character. I'm not a woofter, so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. He's a bloodless cypher. As you might gather, the main characters aren't much cop, but the minor ones manage, amazingly to be much worse. There's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough, but it isn't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly? Forgetting that it was a girlie film, I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him, but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it. I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage. Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. You'd have thought that they'd have got it right. Sadly, though, the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby (but we do as the audience). If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place, then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence... Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan. I didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties.

But playing for a major League team was off limits to Robinson because of his race. Branch Rickey, president and manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, signed (......) Robinson in 1947.

However,at home in my little town in Connecticut,it's different.The distant sound of a police car, all emergency vehicle or a fire siren brings me to my feet if I'm seated and brings me to the window if I'm in bed.It's the quietest sounds that have most effect on us.not the loudest.In the middle of the night, I can hear a dripping tap a hundred yards away thigh three closed doors.I've been hearing little creaking noises and sounds which my imaginnation turns into footsteps in the middle of the night for twenty-five years in our house.How come I never hear those sounds in the daytime? I'm quite clear in my mind what the good sounds are and what the bad sounds are,I've turned against whistling,for instance:I used to think of it as the mark of a happy worker but lately I've been associating the whistler with a nervous person making unconscious noises.The tapping,tapping,tapping of my typewriter as the keys hit the paper is a lovely sound to me.I often like the sound of what I write better than the looks of it.

Clarity: The reviewer uses abbreviations (Gr8, Tnx) which might be understood by most, but can also be confusing for some readers. This reduces the clarity of the review. The message is positive, but not clearly stated. 2. Relevance: The review seems to express gratitude (\\"Tnx a lot!\\") which implies that the reviewer had a positive experience. However, it's difficult to understand the context that this review is about a product or service. 3.

The trial will start on 3 January at La Moye, La Rocque and Fauvic and will last for three months. The trial is open to customers of all telecom operators in Jersey. A JT spokesperson said it was a trial of the network and so JT, Sure and Newtel would be writing to their customers in that area offering them the chance to trial fibre optic broadband. JT say speeds will vary between 40Mbps and 1Gbps during the trial. People trying the service will be expected to give detailed feedback covering everything from installation to the experience of having faster broadband. JT said it would use the feedback to help shape the final product it offers to the public when the service is launched. The service will be available to all homes in the island by 2016, but the first homes will have access to the service by 2012, with most being switched to fibre optic broadband by 2013. Graeme Millar, chief executive of JT, said: \\"Clearly it takes time to replace the island-wide copper cable network, and we nee to do that in stages to minimise disruption and gain appropriate access to the 42,000 homes. \\" Mr Millar said the switchover to a fibre optic network enabling broadband speeds of up to 1Gbps would make it \\"the fastest for a residential network in the western world\\".

Because the guy wanted to make an impression, he left the shirt and wore the blazer instead, since the","response":"blazer represented a more refined, mature look that he was going for. This decision proved to be a balancing act, as he couldn't go too casual by just wearing a shirt, yet he didn't want to appear overly formal either, thus landing his choice on the blazer. The blazer, a navy piece with subtle grey checks, brought an aura of sophistication that the plain shirt just couldn't muster. This lined up perfectly with his aim of the evening - to exude an effortless charm without seeming like he was trying too hard. He wanted to illustrate his ability to be both easygoing and elegant, traits he believed were reflected in his choice of wearing the blazer. The shirt was inevitably a safe option. But the blazer? Wearing it was a silent proclamation of the man he was, something that was tailored just for him. The richness of its fabric, the precision of its cut, and the attention to detail were all elements that went a long way in demonstrating his own high standards. It was the sartorial equivalent of a firm handshake or a steady gaze. But the blazer did more than just lend him an air of sophistication and maturity. It was a carefully orchestrated move to appear distinct. He knew that the room would be filled with many others clad in shirts, so the choice of a blaker gave him a clear edge in the room full of similarly dressed men. Moreover, what he wore was an extension of his personality. A strong yet silent observer, he preferred to let his actions speak louder than any words could. And that evening, his actions revolved around choosing the right outfit to not just fit into the environment, but also to break away from the regular and shine in his own unique light. The blazer was part of this overall strategy, the sartorial armor designed to cast an impression that would resonate with those he interacted with during the evening. The guy wanted to make an impression and he understood the power of the right clothes. In a world where the first impression is largely dictated by appearances, he dressed not just for the job he wanted, but for the perception he wanted to create. He took the risk, leaving behind the familiarity and comfort of the shirt, choosing instead to don the blazer. In doing so, he presented himself as a man who wasn't afraid to step outside his comfort zone, ready to face the world in his own unique style. By the end of the night, it was clear that his choice of attire had been a successful one. Numerous compliments flowed his way, alluding not just to his blazer but to how he carried it with an effortless grace. His choice of apparel helped him stand out in the crowd most subtly, making an impression that was hard to forget. And that's how, by choosing to wear the blazer instead of the shirt, the guy managed to create an impression that struck a delicate balance between casual and formal, emerging as a clear winner in the unspoken game of sartorial choices."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given an open-ended topic (movie name, a persons name, an event, sports, etc) generate a simple trivia-type question.

A: Answer:","response":"Every chemical reaction occurs with a concurrent change in energy. This energy change is mainly due to the breaking and forming of chemical bonds during the reaction. The total energy of a system can be defined broadly into two main categories: potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy represents the stored energy within the chemical bonds, while kinetic energy is the energy of movement associated with the particles in the system (such as atoms, molecules, or ions). In a chemical reaction, the reactants (the initial substances) are changed into products (the final substances), and this transformation involves the rearrangement of the chemical bonds between the particles. When the chemical bonds in the reactants are broken, a certain amount of energy is required to overcome the bond dissociation energy, which is the strength of the bond. This is called the activation energy, and it is the minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur. On the other hand, when new chemical bonds are formed in the products, energy is released. The difference between the energy absorbed in breaking the bonds and the energy released in forming new bonds determines the overall energy change in a chemical reaction. This is known as the enthalpy change (∆H) for the reaction. There are two types of chemical reactions with respect to energy changes: 1. Exothermic reactions: In these reactions, the energy released during the formation of new bonds is greater than the energy absorbed in breaking the initial bonds. The enthalpy change (∆H) is negative, which means that the system loses heat to its surroundings. The products have lower potential energy than the reactants, making these reactions energetically favorable. Examples include combustion reactions and neutralization reactions between acids and bases. 2. Endothermic reactions: In these reactions, the energy absorbed in breaking the initial bonds is greater than the energy released during the formation of new bonds. The enthalpy change (∆H) is positive, which means that the system gains heat from its surroundings. The products have higher potential energy than the reactants, making these reactions energetically unfavorable under certain conditions. Examples include thermal decomposition reactions and photosynthesis. In summary, every chemical reaction occurs with a concurrent change in energy, which is mainly associated with the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. The overall energy change in a chemical reaction, or the enthalpy change, can either be exothermic (releasing energy) or endothermic (absorbing energy). Understanding these energy changes is essential for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and for controlling the reaction conditions for various practical applications in industry, research, and everyday life."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers Pick your answer from: -- negative. -- positive.","response":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers\\" is negative. The sentence implies that the person in question does not want to be identified as someone who has deceived or cheated moviegoers. This act of deception has a negative connotation and thus reflects a negative sentiment. The use of the word \\"bilked\\" in particular carries a negative meaning, as it refers to obtaining something, such as money, from someone by deceit or without justification. Furthermore, the phrase \\"unsuspecting moviegoers\\" suggests that these people were innocent and unaware of the deceitful actions of the person involved, making their victimization even more unfortunate and adding to the negative sentiment of the sentence."},{"question":"OPT: -- No. -- Yes.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering whether it is possible to accurately predict the winning lottery numbers for the next draw, many factors come into play. First, there's the inherent randomness of lottery draws, which are designed to produce outcomes without any discernible pattern. The numbers are typically drawn using a random number generator or a physical method, such as balls being pulled from a drawing machine. This ensures fairness, as no one can predict the winning numbers with certainty. Secondly, we must consider the vast number of potential combinations in a lottery. For example, in a 6/49 lottery, there are 13,983,816 possible combinations. The sheer volume of combinations makes it extremely difficult for anyone to predict the correct numbers, even if they had some information about the drawing process. Furthermore, the lottery operators take numerous measures to maintain the security and integrity of the drawing process. They often employ independent auditing firms, security measures, and strict protocols to prevent any unauthorized tampering or manipulation of the results. Lastly, there have been no verifiable cases of accurate lottery predictions, despite many claims made by self-proclaimed \\"lottery experts.\\" If there was a proven method for predicting lottery numbers, it would likely be well-known and widespread, undermining the fairness and integrity of the lottery itself. In conclusion, due to the inherent randomness of lottery draws, the enormous number of possible combinations, and the security measures taken to ensure fairness, it is not possible to tell or accurately predict the winning lottery numbers for the next draw."},{"question":"Sentence 1: so i was i was a real good piano player but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and and now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to it's kind of sad that i've let that slip away Sentence 2: I wish I could play like I used to when I was younger.

In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones.

Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east. - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties: - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Glorup is a manor house located between Nyborg and Svendborg in the south - east of the Danish island Funen . Rebuilt to the design of Nicolas - Henri Jardin and his pupil Christian Josef Zuber in 1763 -- 65 , it is considered one of the finest Baroque complexes in Denmark and was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon . - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Svendborg is a town on the island of Funen in south-central Denmark, and the seat of Svendborg Municipality. With a population of 26,672 (1 January 2014), Svendborg is Funen's second largest city. In 2000 Svendborg was declared \\"Town of the year\\" in Denmark, and in 2003 it celebrated its 750th anniversary as a market town. By road, Svendborg is located southwest of Copenhagen, south of Aarhus, south of Odense, and east of Faaborg. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016). - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

A:","response":"When a new student like Cameron joins a school due to his military family's relocation, it creates a dynamic change for both the newcomer and the existing students. In this situation, several outcomes are possible for the others at the school, depending on their personalities, attitudes, and experiences. Among these potential developments are the following: 1. Developing empathy and understanding: Having a new student with a unique background may encourage some students to develop empathy for Cameron's situation and foster a sense of understanding toward those who face constant life changes and challenges. 2. Expanding cultural awareness: As a military child, Cameron may have lived in different regions or even countries, exposing him to diverse cultures and experiences. As he shares these experiences, other students may become more culturally aware, leading to stronger social connections and a more inclusive school community. 3. Opportunities for leadership: Some students may take the initiative to help Cameron adjust to the new environment, demonstrating their leadership and mentorship skills. This can further strengthen their character while also fostering friendships between the two. 4. Transformation of existing friendships and relationships: The arrival of a new student like Cameron may alter existing friendships and social dynamics. While some students may be eager to include a newcomer, others may feel threatened or unwilling to adapt. This could result in shifts in social groups and the need for some adjustment among current friendships. 5. Learning to handle differences: Cameron's background and experiences may differ significantly from those of the other students. This could lead to both positive and negative interactions, depending on how open and welcoming the existing students are to diversity. Through these interactions, the students may develop a greater appreciation for differing perspectives and learn to be more accepting of others' backgrounds. 6. Exposure to different academic skills and learning styles: Cameron may have been exposed to various educational systems or teaching methods, which can provide an opportunity for other students to learn from him and vice versa. This exchange of knowledge and experiences can enhance the learning environment and intellectual curiosity among students. 7. Engaging in cooperative and collaborative activities: To better integrate Cameron into the school community, teachers and staff may plan activities designed to encourage students to collaborate. These initiatives can include group projects, peer tutoring, and extracurricular clubs where students learn from and support each other. Overall, the arrival of a new student like Cameron due to his military family's relocation presents both challenges and opportunities for growth and development among the other students.

Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism.

Penalties on Washington's defense helped allow a short McNabb to Brian Westbrook touchdown pass on Philadelphia's opening drive. A fumble by L. J. Smith gave Washington the ball inside Eagle territory, and Jason Campbell capitalized with a touchdown pass to James Thrash, the former Eagle. The extra point was missed, but Campbell hit Thrash for another score later in the second quarter. The two-point conversion failed, leaving it 12-7 Washington. A Redskin field goal stretched Philadelphia's deficit to 15-7 in the third quarter, but L. J. Smith, who spent much of the early season injured, caught an eight-yard touchdown from McNabb. The Eagles went for two to try to tie it, but were not successful. Campbell fired back with his third touchdown pass, this one to Keenan McCardell, to make it 22-13. McNabb needed five plays to get the points back, launching a 45-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown for the touchdown. Ladell Betts fumbled the ball away in Eagle territory on Washington's next possession, but McNabb was sacked and fumbled it back to the Redskins on the next play. The Redskins eventually had first-and-goal from the three-yard line, but the Philadelphia defense had yet another huge goal-line stand, and Washington settled for a field goal to go up 25-20. The Eagles got the ball back with four minutes to play, and Westbrook immediately took a short pass and broke free for a 57-yard touchdown to go ahead 26-25 (the two-point conversion failing again). The defense came up big again, with Mike Patterson sacking Campbell to jar the ball loose, and Trent Cole recovering. Westbrook carried it in from ten yards out to seal the deal. McNabb, who surpassed Ron Jaworski for the most career completions in franchise history (2,090 at game's end), passed for 251 yards and four touchdowns in the 33-25 win. Westbrook rushed for 100 yards and had 83 receiving yards, with three total touchdowns. The comeback win improved the Eagles record to 4-5.

How we know is: Philadelphia's team, the Eagles, scored 7 points from the touchdown at the start. Washington's team, the Redskins, scored 12 points. They got 6 points from each of the two touchdowns, but they missed one extra point and the two-point conversion. So, if you add the Eagles' 7 points to the Redskins' 12 points, that gives you a total of 19 points for the first half."},{"question":"In this task, you will be given a short story.

The premise states that the girl possessed a gamin-like quality and got on well with small boys. Gamin is a term used to describe a streetwise, often mischievous, and free-spirited child, typically a boy. While this aspect of her personality may have facilitated her interactions with small boys, it does not necessarily imply that she had the same level of success building relationships with other girls. To determine whether the hypothesis – that the girl got along well with other girls – is true, additional information about her relationships and interactions with girls would be needed. It is important to consider that individuals can display various traits and patterns of behavior in different contexts or with different groups of people. Consequently, the girl's ability to connect with small boys, despite providing insight into one aspect of her social life, does not inherently guarantee her ability to connect with other girls.

A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment. The Iris logo, and the hair-pulling it was causing for all of us—which is a pretty good representation of the steps that Web projects go through as we move from idea, to execution, to setback, to solution. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does Lanni think of starting a new job? Options: A. Lanni is confident in his skills B. Lanni is only somewhat confident in his skills C. not enough information D. Lanni is not confident in his skills","response":"C. not enough information"},{"question":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How did Chairman Sam Longson feel about the investment? anxious The answer is:","response":"Title: Anxious Aspirations Plot Summary: The movie revolves around the life of Chairman Sam Longson, a wealthy and influential businessman who has recently invested a significant sum in a promising but risky film project.

White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians.

Organisation: The term \\"organisation\\" signifies the subject or the main entity involved in the sentence. It could refer to a company, a group, or even an individual. This word establishes who or what achieved the result mentioned in the sentence. Without the word \\"organisation,\\" we would not know who managed to achieve second place after the dramatic finish. 2. Manages: The word \\"manages\\" is important as it implies the effort or struggle the organisation went through in order to achieve a specific outcome, which in this case is securing the second place. It suggests that there was competition or challenges that had to be overcome, and the process was not easy or without complications. 3. Second place: \\"Second place\\" is crucial to understanding the outcome and the overall context of the sentence. It demonstrates the ranking or position of the organisation in a competitive environment or event. With this information, we know that the organisation was not the winner but still managed to perform well and achieve a respectable result. 4. Dramatic finish: Lastly, the phrase \\"dramatic finish\\" adds an element of tension and excitement to the overall meaning of the sentence. It suggests that the event or competition had an unexpected, thrilling, or intense conclusion. This description of the finish implies that the organisation's achievement (securing second place) was hard-fought, perhaps even up until the last moments, and that the outcome was uncertain until the end. In summary, the words \\"organisation,\\" \\"manages,\\" \\"second place,\\" and \\"dramatic finish\\" are the most important words in the sentence. They work together to paint a vivid picture of an event or competition in which an organisation fought hard to achieve a respectable ranking and made it to second place after a suspenseful and intense conclusion."},{"question":"Lucille is wondering who has the tallest house between her and her neighbors. His family's house is 80 feet tall. One neighbor's house is 70 feet tall. Another neighbor's house is 99 feet tall. How much shorter is Lucille's house than the average height? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To determine how much shorter Lucille's house is compared to the average height of the houses, we'll first need to find the average height of all three houses. To do this, we can add the heights of the three houses together and then divide by the total number of houses (which is 3). Here are the heights of the three houses: 1. Lucille's house: 80 feet tall 2. Neighbor 1's house: 70 feet tall 3. Neighbor 2's house: 99 feet tall First, let's add up the heights of all three houses: 80 feet (Lucille's house) + 70 feet (Neighbor 1's house) + 99 feet (Neighbor 2's house) = 249 feet (total height) Now, let's find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of houses (3): 249 feet / 3 = 83 feet (average height) Now that we've found the average height of the houses, we can determine how much shorter Lucille's house is by subtracting its height from the average height: 83 feet (average height) - 80 feet (Lucille's house) = 3 feet So, Lucille's house is 3 feet shorter than the average height of the houses."},{"question":"He urged the US to provide clear rules on what would happen at possible trials .

Both statements emphasize a desire or request for the United States to establish precise regulations or guidelines for potential trials.

And if he wins the nomination, such issues will almost certainly rise again, given that he will run against a war hero, in Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is advised by several veterans of the campaign against Mr. Kerry. Mr. Obama himself seemed chastened by the re-emergence of the old politics last week. “Let’s be honest,” he said in an interview on NBC. “You know, here I am, an African-American named Barack Obama who’s running for president. I mean, that’s a leap for folks. And I think it’s understandable that my political opponents would say, ‘You know, he’s different. He’s odd. He’s sort of unfamiliar. And what do we know about him?’ ” There is a subtext for this history lesson: Mr. Obama’s rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, is running hard on the notion that she is the more electable candidate, that what she calls her “baggage” has been thoroughly vetted, and that she has survived 16 years of the harshest Republican attacks. But David Axelrod, chief strategist to Mr. Obama, argues that any Democratic nominee will be subject to the same withering attacks on values and character. “The question,” Mr. Axelrod said, “is whether given the abysmal state of our economy, given the war, given all the challenges that people sense we face that have led George Bush to have the lowest rating ever, do you believe that voters are going to be distracted from the fundamental need for change? I think the answer to that is no.” In fact, as Mr. Axelrod suggests, these are very different times. Twenty years ago, the nation was in an era of comparative peace and prosperity; a sense of crisis did not hang over the election. Today, with the war in Iraq in its sixth year and the economy stumbling, more than 8 in 10 Americans say the country is on the wrong track. A new generation of voters have entered the electorate, who may not be as susceptible to values issues. In such a climate, it would presumably be far more difficult than in 1988 to keep the campaign focused on symbolic, values-related issues, or matters of personality. There are differences, as well, in the political skills of the candidates then and today: Mr. Obama rose to national prominence largely on the basis of his oratorical skills, and has never been accused of lacking vision; Mr. Dukakis based his campaign on a prosaic promise of managerial competence and “good jobs at good wages.” And yet, some veterans of past Democratic campaigns say, there are similarities, as well. Even with so many big issues at stake this time around, the race between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton has often been focused on questions of values, background and character — witness the recent fixation on Mr. Obama’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., or the continued unfounded rumors that Mr. Obama is a Muslim. Like Mr. Dukakis in 1988, Mr. Obama is relatively new to the national scene, and thus vulnerable to being defined by Republican attacks. And like Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Obama lacks experience with the politics of wedge issues on a national stage. Attacks on a presidential candidate’s patriotism are hard for many politicians to take seriously. “Unless you’re talking about the Manchurian candidate, the idea that someone who put their heart and soul into running for president didn’t care deeply for their country is kind of ridiculous,” said Drew Westen, a psychologist and political consultant. Still, one of the clearest strategic errors of 1988 was the Democrats’ failure to realize that such attacks could stick and open the door to broader efforts to portray Mr. Dukakis as fundamentally out of sync with the nation’s values. “The attacks against Dukakis, which were systematic and attacked his patriotism, did a lot of damage to him,” said Tad Devine, a top advisor to the Dukakis campaign and the campaign of Mr. Kerry in 2004. “They developed words and phrases that essentially said this guy is not part of the mainstream.” If Mr. Obama is the nominee, Mr. Devine said, “I think it will happen again, and it will be aimed at both the candidate and his wife.” Michelle Obama has already drawn conservative fire for declaring that, because of her husband’s success and the voters’ hunger for change, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country.” And Mr. Obama has been questioned about why he does not wear a flag pin every day. In 1988, one of the central attacks revolved around the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Dukakis, as governor, had vetoed state legislation in 1977 that required teachers to lead their students in the pledge. He did so on the basis of an advisory opinion from the state court, which said the legislation was unconstitutional. Mr. Dukakis, a Harvard lawyer surrounded by other Harvard lawyers, believed himself on very firm ground. But by August 1988, his Republican opponent, Vice President George H.W. Bush, was rousing huge crowds with a contemptuous question: “What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?” Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Bush said, was “out in deep left field on these issues.” He was also “a card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.,” more concerned with giving furloughs to criminals — like Willie Horton — than upholding national values, the vice president asserted. “I simply can’t understand the kind of thinking that lets first-degree murderers out of jail on a furlough and won’t deal with the Pledge of Allegiance,” Mr. Bush said. Mr. Dukakis defended his patriotism and scoffed at Mr. Bush for wrapping himself in the flag, but, in essence, lost control of the campaign and his own image. After his loss, in 40 states, many Democratic leaders swore they would never be caught off guard that way again. Mr. Obama faces different issues, beginning with Mr. Wright, who suggested last week that the United States was attacked by terrorists because it had itself engaged in terrorism; Mr. Obama has now denounced his former pastor. He has been challenged, as well, about his relationship with a former radical from the 1960s; Mr. Obama says he simply served on the board of a foundation with the man. The questions may be taking a toll: The New York Times/CBS News Poll last week found 29 percent found him “very patriotic,” compared with 40 percent who felt that way about Mrs. Clinton, and 70 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war. The lessons of history are fairly clear for Democrats, said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council and a longtime Clinton ally. “Republicans have been trying to put us in the same box for 40 years now,” Mr. Reed said. “We win elections when we don’t let them.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: ’88 Campaign Offers a Lesson In Using Symbols as Bludgeons.

They claim to be looking for a serial killer who strangles his victims and to need his help. Before he leaves, his landlady, who wants to marry him, gives him a small paper bag with pepper in it. Irmy (Farrow) and her boyfriend Paul (Malkovich), performers at a circus, are having a dispute about getting married and having a baby. Paul leaves and goes to another tent where Marie, a tightrope artist (Madonna), waits for him. They begin to have sex, but Irmy catches them and runs away to the city. There, she meets a prostitute (Lily Tomlin) who brings her to a house of ill-repute, where she is comforted by other prostitutes (Jodie Foster and Kathy Bates). Then, a student named Jack (John Cusack) comes into the whorehouse and is immediately bewitched by Irmy; he insists on having sex with her, paying 700. On the street, Kleinman walks aimlessly around the city. He stops at a coroner's house, where the doctor (Donald Pleasence) explains that his role in the hunt is purely scientific. They each have a glass of sherry. After Kleinman leaves, the doctor is murdered by the Strangler. Kleinman, seeing a local family being evicted as 'undesirables', goes to the police station to try to stop the eviction. Whilst there, a police officer arrives with news of the coroner's death, saying that there is a clue â a glass with fingerprints on it.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"three years\\" correctly answer the question \\"How many years passed between Portugal declaring bankruptcy and the assassination of King Carlos and Prince Luis Filipe?\\"?","response":"No, the response \\"three years\\" does not correctly answer the question. The text does not provide a direct connection between Portugal declaring bankruptcy in 1892 and the assassination of King Carlos and Prince Luis Filipe on 1 February 1908.

Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: The young D'Artagnan wants to be a musketeer and for this he travels the long way to the city of Paris in France, where he will enter the same academy for musketeers that his father had attended. On his way to Paris, however, he meets up with Monsieur Rochefort. D'Artagnan does not know that his rivalry with Monsieur Rochefort will get him involved in a battle against the evil plot thought up by Cardinal Richelieu against the king and queen of France. When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham in England, a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to blackmail the queen and create a difficult situation between her and King Louis, who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this. Shortly after entering the academy of musketeers, D'Artagnan meets three of the finest among them, Porthos, Athos and Aramis. Though their first meeting had not gone well and had led to the challenging of several duels, the four of them become fine friends shortly after, since all four fight against the Cardinal's soldiers. When searching for lodging in Paris, D'Artagnan meets the lovely Constance Bonacieux, a good friend of the queen. Cardinal Richelieu orders all of the queen's closest friends to be arrested so that no one will be able to defend her once King Louis decides to have her beheaded. D'Artagnan defends Constance when a group of soldiers try to insolently have her arrested and then takes her to the safety of the queen. Constance trusts the queen and when she learns of the awful accusation that's been laid upon her, the woman asks of D'Artagnan to travel to England and fetch the Duke of Buckingham, the only one who may now save the queen.

It is a recently minted term; previously gentilic was recorded in English dictionaries, e.g., the \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" and \\"Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary\\". - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life. - The Flemish Region ( Dutch : Vlaams Gewest ; French : Région flamande ) is one of the three official regions of the Kingdom of Belgium -- alongside the Walloon Region and the Brussels - Capital Region . Colloquially , it is usually simply referred to as Flanders . It occupies the northern part of Belgium and covers an area of 13,522 km2 ( 44.29 % of Belgium ) . It is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe with around 470 inhabitants per square kilometer . - Belgians are the citizens and natives of the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Belgium is a federal state comprising three communities, three regions, and four language areas. For each of these subdivision types, the subdivisions together make up the entire country; in other words, the types overlap. - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Western Europe, also West Europe, is the region comprising the western part of the European continent. There may be differences between the geopolitical and purely geographic definitions of the term. - In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified. - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.

Context: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

Reigning Commonwealth champion Dai Greene, 28, and world record holder Aled Sion Davies, 23, spearhead a 33-strong athletics squad. Greene took gold in the 400m hurdles in Delhi 2010 and narrowly missed out on a medal in London 2012, where he finished fourth in the final, and fellow hurdler Rhys Williams, the reigning European champion, will also be competing in the 400m hurdles. Yet neither athlete made it to the final of the 2013 IAAF World Championships in Athletics, with both men going out at the semi-final stage - world champion Jehue Gordon, 25, will represent Trinidad & Tobago and is a favourite to take the gold medal in Glasgow. This is further complicated as Dai Greene has questioned his chances of securing a medal as he is still recovering after undergoing three hernia operations in 2013. Team Wales have announced that despite this news, as well as the injuries that have ruled out triathletes Helen Jenkins and Non Stanford, and cyclist Becky James, the target of 27 medals will not be revised. The gold medal prospect in athletics for Wales is double world champion Aled Sion Davies, who followed a gold medal at London 2012 with two further golds at the IPC Athletics World Championships. Davies is still improving too - on May 31 he set a new world record in the discus F42 category with a throw of 48.78m, and he claims to be \\"looking forward to beating 50m this year\\". Women's doubles pair Carissa Turner and Sarah Thomas will carry Wales' badminton hopes. Crowned champions at the Iceland International and Portuguese Open, Turner and Thomas are ranked 56th in the world as a doubles pair - although after removing all ineligible athletes from the list, Turner and Thomas would be ranked 15th. And Turner says that the pair have \\"a good chance with the right draw\\" of winning a medal in Glasgow, following a series of good tournament performances in 2014. The pair won two tournaments and reached two semi-finals in January and March, as well as retaining their titles at the National Championships in February. Joe Morgan, 35, will compete at his third Commonwealth Games alongside Nick Strange in the men's doubles, with the pair ranked 73rd in the world. The lawn bowls squad was announced in December 2013 and features 15 competitors ranging in age from 25 to 71. Half the squad will be making their Commonwealth Games debuts. Robert Weale, 51, is one of the most experienced and decorated athletes travelling to Glasgow, having represented Wales at every Games since 1986 and amassed two gold, three silver and one bronze medal. His most recent gold came in Delhi four years ago. Weale is the most-capped bowler in Welsh history, with 103 outdoor and 54 indoor, and expected to take his tally to 160 before Glasgow. Others to watch are Anwen Butten and Caroline Taylor. Butten has twice won bronze in the pairs event, in 2002 with Joanna Weale and 2010 with partner Hannah Smith. Taylor, who will partner her in Glasgow, has won three medals at the World Outdoor Championships - a silver in the pairs and bronze in the fours in 2004, and a bronze in the triples in 2012. A 9-strong amateur boxing team will make the trip to Glasgow. Andrew Selby, 25, is one of the realistic medal prospects. Competing in the flyweight 52kg category, he is the current world number one in the official International Boxing Association (AIBA) standings. At the 2011 European Championships in Turkey, he became the first Welshman in 86 years to win gold, and followed that by becoming the first British fighter to defend an amateur title two years later. Welterweight Fred Evans of Cardiff, who won silver at the 2012 Olympics, will be unable to compete after he was refused accreditation. Sean McGoldrick, 23, was awarded gold in the bantamweight category at the 2010 Commonwealth Games after the man who beat him in the final was disqualified. McGoldrick did not compete in the 2012 Olympics, having lost out to eventual gold medallist Luke Campbell in qualifying, but Campbell's decision to turn professional rules him out of the Games and gives McGoldrick a chance to reach the final once again. Wales' hope for a cycling medal at the Games falls to double Olympic champion Geraint Thomas, after two-time world champion Becky James was forced to withdraw through injury. They were previously both named in the 17-member cycling squad for events on the road and in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. James, 22, won silver in the sprint and bronze in the 500m time trial in Delhi in 2010 as well as a historic double gold at the , but the world champion has aggravated a knee injury and will now be unable to compete. Geraint Thomas, who won gold in the team pursuit at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, will be supported by fellow Team Sky rider Luke Rowe on the road. 28-year-old Thomas will be competing in the time-trial in Glasgow and will be buoyed by his silver medal performance at the in Monmouthshire. He also finished eighth in the road race in Abergavenny ahead of the Tour de France, which begins on 5 July. World team pursuit champion Elinor Barker came fourth in the elite women's time trial, beating Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell as she came just shy of a podium finish, and the 19-year-old has told BBC Wales that she is targeting a gold medal in Glasgow. World cup medallists Jon Mould, Sam Harrison and Owain Doull will also be hoping to contribute, though it would take a special performance from either of these men to make it to the podium. Wales have a target of three medals for their squad of 13 gymnasts, with the main hopes coming in the rhythmic gymnastics. Frankie Jones, 23, took silver at the Delhi games in 2010 in the hoop event and at Glasgow 2014 she will be competing both individually and as part of a team. Despite her success in Delhi, Jones came bottom of qualification in London 2012 and since then suffered a hip injury that she feared would end her career. Yet she came second in the British Championships in May 2014 with a single mistake costing her - the gold medal was taken by fellow Welsh athlete Laura Halford, 18, who posted a score of 61.465 across the ball, hoop, ribbon and clubs. Halford and Jones may be a medal prospect in the team event, where they will compete alongside 19-year-old Nikara Jenkins. Wales will be sending men's and women's teams to Glasgow for the first time since 1998 in Kuala Lumpur, with the women's side including Xenna Hughes, the daughter of former Wales football manager Mark Hughes. The women performed well in the third tier of the European Championships in 2013, winning every game to take gold, but a podium finish will likely prove beyond them. It will be harder for the male team who will play in the Commonwealth Games for the first time since 2002. In contrast to the women's team, the men's squad will remain in the third tier of the European Championship as they lost to winners Portugal. Wales have never won a hockey medal at a games and recent results would suggest that it would take a series of inspired team performances to change that. National coach Craig Ewers will compete as part of a 10-strong team as judo returns for the first time since 2002. The 33-year-old is the only team member with experience of a major multi-sport competition. Natalie Powell, 23, could be a real prospect for Wales in the -78kg category. following a defeat to eventual gold medallist Marhinde Verkerk from the Netherlands, whilst silver was taken by Slovenian Anamari Velensek. The last time the world rankings were announced, Powell was ranked 11th in the world with only one athlete ranked higher than her eligible for the Commonwealth Games - Canadian Catherine Roberge. Sport Wales chair Laura McAllister tipped netball to be the following their impressive World Cup qualification victories over Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Scotland. 12 players will be sent to Glasgow, with former captain Billy Pritchard recalled following several years out. The squad is without experienced defenders Sara Hale, Rosie Pretorius and Stephanie Williams, who have all been ruled out through injury. And the situation surrounding ex-coach Melissa Hyndman, will not have made things any easier. Interim manager Laura Williams, who was responsible for the three victories that secured World Cup qualification, says Wales are in Glasgow. But Wales are currently eighth in the world rankings and every team above them will be competing at the Commonwealth Games, giving them only a slim chance of reaching the podium. New Blues centre Adam Thomas, 27, will captain the Wales Sevens side during Glasgow 2014. Thomas previously led Wales Sevens during the Glasgow and London Sevens competition, having helped former club Pontypridd to their third consecutive Premiership title. Wales have two full internationals in their side, with Scarlets full back Gareth Owen picked alongside former Dragons winger Will Harries. But Sevens is one of the few disciplines where all the best competitors are eligible. For a podium finish, Wales would have to get by South Africa, England or Australia - not to mention New Zealand, who have not lost a single match since Sevens' inclusion in 1998. Though Wales will not have to face Fiji, who beat Wales 26-19 in the 2013 Hong Kong Sevens final, as the Southern Hemisphere side have not been permitted to compete in the Sevens. Elena Allen, 41, will be competing in the skeet event as part of a 14-strong shooting squad. She came 14th in the qualifying round of the 2012 Olympics, though none of the shooters who finished ahead of her are eligible for Glasgow, and neither are any of those above her in the world rankings. Their absence should give Allen a realistic chance of a first medal. The squash side will feature seven players across four events. David Evans, 39, of Pontypool is a 10-time Welsh national champion, who came first in the mixed doubles at the 2014 British Open alongside Deon Saffrey. Peter Creed, 27, will also be travelling to Glasgow. He is ranked 77th in the world and has beaten Evans to the Welsh Nationals title in recent years. Seven swimmers are in the aquatics team, with head coach Martyn Woodroffe calling it \\"the strongest Welsh team that we've ever sent to a Commonwealth Games\\". At the forefront is Jazz Carlin, 23, who will be competing in the 400m and 800m freestyle. She set the fastest 800m freestyle time in the world in April, breaking her own Welsh record. Carlin won a bronze and silver medal in Delhi four years ago, and her chances in Glasgow are improved as Rebecca Adlington, who beat her to gold in both events in 2010, has retired. Jemma Lowe, 24, will be competing in the 100m and 200m butterfly in Glasgow and is a realistic prospect for the latter as she holds the British short course record. Lowe also made it to the final of the 2012 Olympics in this event, coming sixth behind opponents from non-Commonwealth countries China, Japan, Spain, Hungary and the United States. She has all six Welsh records achievable in the butterfly - the 50m, 100m and 200m in both long and short courses - to her name, and she told BBC Wales that she wants a podium finish in Glasgow after securing 200m gold at the International Swimming Championships. Georgia Davies, 23, will be competing in the 50m backstroke. Officially, she was 14th fastest in the world when she competed at Antwerp in January but has the quickest time of any of the eligible Commonwealth Games competitors. A young squad will represent Wales in Glasgow, including 20-year-old twins Angharad and Megan Phillips. The team also includes Naomi Owen, 25, who has won the Welsh women's singles championship nine times. However, over 300 places separate her from Singaporean Tianwei Feng in the official International Table Tennis Federation rankings. Charlotte Carey, 17, has been named for the second time, having been part of the squad that travelled to Delhi in 2010. She also faces tough opposition - Singapore have dominated the medals table since the sport joined the Commonwealth Games in 2002. Wales have only previously managed one medal, when current player-coach Ryan Jenkins took silver in the men's doubles alongside Adam Robertson in 2002. Wales originally intended to send an experienced side to Glasgow, with former ITU world champions Non Stanford, 25, and Helen Jenkins, 30, joined by 23-year-old Holly Lawrence. The triathlon had been an event in which Wales had strong medal claims, but their podium hopes have plummeted. Two-time world champion Jenkins has pulled out of the Games with a foot injury, while Stanford has been ruled out by an ankle fracture. A replacement has yet to be named for Jenkins, while Stanford has been replaced by Carol Bridge, a 29-year-old athlete who won the Outlaw Half in 2013. Media playback is not supported on this device Michaela Breeze, who won gold at the 2002 and 2006 Games and won silver as she captained the Wales team in Delhi four years ago, hopes to continue her successful record in Glasgow. She believes the Welsh weightlifters can come back from Glasgow with - one more than the target set by Sport Wales. Breeze came out of retirement in a bid to compete at the Games and proved her ability by breaking the British snatch record in qualifying. Wales take a small and experienced team to Glasgow, but every athlete will need to be on top form in order to break the nation's duck. Wales have never taken a wrestling medal in the history of the Games, and it would be hard to see that changing with the squad sent to Glasgow. Thomas Hawthorn, 18, is the youngest of the five wrestlers selected and he has no Commonwealth Games experience. Damion Arzu, 31, Craig Pilling, 27, and Sarah Connolly, 25, all competed in 2010 - though only one of the wrestlers was able to record a victory in Delhi. Pilling was beaten in the 55kg freestyle bronze medal match by India's Anil Kumar after he defeated Scott Gregory of England in three rounds.

Title: Rails & Ties Movie plot: Laura Danner is a mentally ill, single mother who takes illegal drugs and is unable to care for her 10-year-old son Davey. Driven to despair, she decides to commit suicide by driving a car on to a railway track, taking Davey with her. She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks. As a train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not. However, the train hits and kills the boy's mother. Subsequently, the railroad company calls for an internal inquiry and suspends the two drivers. Davey has spent the first night after the incident with an empathetic social worker, Susan Garcia. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother. Later on, after being confined to his room, he escapes by shattering the window. The authorities are alerted and a missing persons search is initiated. The boy obtains train conductor Tom Stark's home address. He turns up at the Starks' home and berates Tom for accidentally killing his mother in the train crash, but eventually he is placated.

Having already undergone a mastectomy, she has decided that she will no longer endure chemotherapy and must accept her inevitable death.

Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? === The answer to the above question is OPTIONS: -- Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same. -- not enough information -- They will be enrolled in a study. -- They will call their doctor.

Article: The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. Question: What caused milk prices in California to increase? Options: A: Short supplies from other states. B: Being short of rain. C: The California court. D: Children's need for milk.","response":"The correct answer is B: Being short of rain. The article states that there was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year, and this bad weather may cause the price of a gallon of milk to increase."},{"question":"In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the general math. Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Problem: a certain social security recipient will receive an annual benefit of 12,000 provided he has annual earnings of 9,360 or less , but the benefit will be reduced by 1 for every 3 of annual earnings over 9,360 . what amount of total annual earnings would result in a 55 percent reduction in the recipient ' s annual social security benefit ? ( assume social security benefits are not counted as part of annual earnings . ) Options: a ) 15,360 , b ) 17,360 , c ) 25,560 , d ) 21,360 , e ) 27,360","response":"Let's first find the amount of the recipient's benefits that would be reduced by 55 percent. 55% reduction of 12,000 = 0.55 * 12,000 = 6,600 This means that the remaining benefit to be received equals 12,000 - 6,600 = 5,400. Now, let's find out how much the recipient's earnings should exceed 9,360 in order to have a reduction of 6,600. Since the benefit is reduced at a rate of 1 per every 3 of annual earnings over 9,360, we can calculate the needed excess as follows: Excess needed = 6,600 * 3 = 19,800 Finally, we need to find the amount of total annual earnings by adding this excess to 9,360: Total annual earnings = 9,360 + 19,800 = 29,160 As we can see, the answer doesn't match any of the options provided. However, based on the calculations, the correct amount of total annual earnings would be 29,160."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Take karat weight into consideration last. Consider selecting an uncommon size karat to save money without sacrificing quality. If buying an engagement ring or gift, find out what the recipient prefers in size. Consider the size of the wearer's hand if buying a diamond ring.\\"","response":"Title: Choosing the Perfect Diamond: Importance of Karat Weight and Size Hello little friends! Do you know about diamonds? Diamonds are very pretty, sparkly stones that people often give as gifts or use in special rings like engagement rings. Today, we will learn about how to choose the best diamond by considering its karat weight and size. Don't worry, I will explain everything in a simple way! First of all, let's learn what \\"karat weight\\" means. Imagine a teeny-tiny scale that can measure how heavy a diamond is. The weight of the diamond is measured in \\"karats.\\" Diamonds can be different sizes, and the bigger they are, the more karats they usually have. When choosing a diamond, it's a good idea to think about the karat weight last. This means that you should first focus on other things like the diamond's shape, color, and how sparkly it is. After you have decided on those things, then you can think about the diamond's size. Sometimes, if you want to save a little bit of money, you can choose a diamond that is not a very common size. For example, instead of picking a diamond that has a whole number of karats, like 1 or 2, you can choose one that has a different number like 1.89. This way, the diamond might be a tiny bit smaller, but it will still look very beautiful, and it will cost less! Now, if you want to buy a diamond ring for someone special, like a mom, dad, or even a friend, it's important to find out what they like in terms of size. Some people may prefer a big diamond, while others might like something smaller. Remember, it's all about making the person who gets the ring happy! Lastly, when you are buying a diamond ring, it's a good idea to think about the size of the person's hand who will wear it. If they have a big hand, a larger diamond might look better. But, if they have a small hand, then a smaller diamond could look just as pretty, too! In conclusion, choosing the perfect diamond is all about thinking about the right things at the right time. It's important to consider the karat weight, the size of the diamond, and the preferences of the person who will wear the ring. By doing this, you can be sure that the diamond you choose will be just perfect!"},{"question":"Miit is a Hindi language Indian television series that aired on Zee TV channel in 2003, Monday through Thursday evenings.

Over the years, Buddy seldom saw either of his parents. But he was happy where he was and he had many kindly s, among whom Miss Sook was by far his best friend. Before Christmas, Buddy's father had managed to get legal custody of him for this Christmas. So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus. The worst thought was: Had Sook known the truth, and lied to me? No, Sook would never lie to me. She believed. It was just that--well, though she was sixty-something, in some ways she was at least as much of a child as I was. I waited until I was sure he was in bed and sound asleep. Then I crept downstairs and examined the tags attached to each of the packages. They all said: \\"For Buddy.\\" I decided to open the packages: It was Christmas morning. I was awake, so why not?

Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men. Guess a valid title for it!

Here is a detailed course of action for Quinn: 1. Organize the collection: To make it easier for Carson to browse and understand the collection, Quinn should first spend time categorizing the records. This can be done by organizing them alphabetically by artist or band, by music genre, or even by the era of release. This will make it convenient for Carson to find specific albums, and it will also demonstrate Quinn's passion and knowledge about music. 2. Clean the records and their storage: Since record collections require proper care to maintain their quality, Quinn should ensure that the records are clean and free from dust or dirt.

Additionally, Quinn ought to tidy up the shelving or storage area where the records are kept to provide a neat and welcoming environment. 3. Prepare a list of personal favorites and recommendations: Given that Quinn has a huge record collection, it may be challenging for Carson to decide where to start. As a solution, Quinn can create a list of their personal favorites to showcase the gems within the collection. This will provide Carson with a glimpse into Quinn's musical taste and may serve as a starting point for engaging conversations. 4. Set up a comfortable atmosphere: To make the entire experience enjoyable for Carson, Quinn should consider preparing a cozy listening area. This might involve setting up a pair of high-quality speakers or headphones for an immersive listening experience, arranging comfortable seating, and if possible, creating a relaxed ambiance with soft lighting. 5. Plan a guided tour: If Quinn is particularly proud of certain aspects of their collection, such as rare or signed albums, they should plan a guided tour for Carson. This provides an opportunity to share personal anecdotes and highlight the stories behind particular albums, further piquing Carson's interest. 6. Be prepared to answer questions and discuss music: Lastly, Quinn should be ready to answer any questions Carson might have about the records or their artists, as well as engage in open discussions about personal preferences, favorite tracks, and standout albums.

A:","response":"Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, attended two different colleges in the course of his higher education journey. He went to Fordham University for the first two years of his college education and then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania to complete his degree. A: In 1964, Donald Trump began his college education at Fordham University, a private Jesuit institution located in the Bronx, New York City. He spent two years at Fordham, where he presumably took general education courses and studied liberal arts. The reason as to why Donald Trump chose Fordham is not precisely known, but some speculate that the decision may have been influenced by a few factors including the institution's location, reputation, and Catholic Jesuit tradition. After two years at Fordham, Trump made the decision to transfer to another prestigious educational institution – the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Established in 1881, the Wharton School is renowned worldwide for its strong business and finance programs, and it holds the distinction of being the world's first collegiate business school. Trump's father, Fred Trump, was a successful real estate developer, and it is likely that Donald Trump's interest in real estate and business was sparked by his father's career. In 1966, Trump transferred to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School – a member of the Ivy League – located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The reason for the transfer is believed to be Trump's growing interest in business and real estate, which led him to seek a more targeted education in these fields. He specifically chose the Wharton School for its strong reputation in these areas. At the Wharton School, Donald Trump pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics with a concentration in Finance. During his time at Wharton, he was exposed to industry-leading business and finance courses taught by accomplished professors. This expertise helped lay the groundwork for his future career in real estate development and business management. In May 1968, Trump successfully graduated from the Wharton School with his Bachelor of Science degree in Economics. The education he received from both Fordham University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania played a critical role in shaping Donald Trump's approach to real estate, deal-making, and business management throughout his career."},{"question":"Did you have any favourite experiences on your trip ?

I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it is even better than I remembered it to be. Paperhouse is much more than just a horror. It had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether. Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end when she realised that although Marc had died, she knew he was going to be alright. Several scenes did make me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust.

First World War A:","response":"Title: The Shadow of Memory Genre: War, Drama, Mystery Plot Summary: Albert, a young man in his mid-20s, has grown up knowing that his father, James, died in the First World War. His mother, Mary, has desperately held onto the memory of her late husband and raised Albert with stories of the great life James led, his bravery, and the love he had for his family. However, as the years go by, Albert discovers a war medal, hidden away in the attic, that raises questions about his father's true identity. Intrigued, Albert begins to piece together the pieces of the puzzle that was James' life, determined to uncover the truth about his father. Along the way, he meets Sarah, an aspiring writer, who shares in his quest for truth and completes the gaps in the story he uncovers. Together, Albert and Sarah discover that James was indeed a soldier in the First World War - but that he did not die on the battlefield. It turns out James was taken as a prisoner of war and, after a daring escape, he had been living a new life in hiding, ashamed of the haunting memories of war and the acts of brutality he was forced to commit as a soldier. Through a close family friend, whom Albert and Sarah interview, they learn that James was torn between the desire to return home to Mary and their child and the fear of retribution he might face for deserting the war. Ultimately, his devotion to the family led him to make a heart-wrenching decision: he sacrificed himself in a high-risk operation to save the lives of several fellow soldiers, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of those who mattered. As Albert learns the truth, he confronts his mother and discovers her reason for concealing the true story. Mary, aware of James' struggles, wanted to protect her son from the darker aspects of his father's life. In her eyes, it was better for Albert to remember his father as a hero, fallen in the line of duty. In the end, Albert and Sarah choose to immortalize James' story in a book, detailing the complexities of a man, caught between his duty and love. The book becomes a bestseller and helps many families heal from the wounds of World War I. Mary learns to embrace the truth and finds new love with a kind-hearted veteran, while Albert and Sarah's friendship blossoms into romance, both finding solace in the memories of the past and hope for the future."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the below conversation.

This move demonstrates the country's proactive approach in combating this highly contagious disease and protecting both animal and human populations. Step 1: Identify the Threat Canadian health authorities have identified an outbreak of avian flu, specifically the H5N1 strain, in poultry farms across the country. This disease poses a significant threat not only to birds, but also to humans who could potentially contract the virus. Step 2: Establish a Control Zone To effectively combat the spread of the avian flu, Canada has set up a control area, which is a designated region encompassing infected farms and surrounding areas. This enables health authorities to monitor and regulate the movement of birds, equipment and personnel within the zone, preventing further dissemination of the virus. Step 3: Implement Strict Biosecurity Measures Farm owners and workers within the control area are required to observe strict biosecurity measures to limit the virus's transmission. These include wearing protective gear, regularly disinfecting premises, and avoiding the transfer of birds between farms. The general public is urged to report any signs of sick or dead wild birds around the affected areas as well. Step 4: Monitor and Test Domestic and Wild Birds Health authorities will conduct regular testing and monitoring of both domestic and wild birds to determine the extent of the virus's spread. This entails collecting samples from live and dead birds and analyzing them for avian flu strains. Step 5: Quarantine and Cull Infected Birds Infected birds will be subjected to quarantine and culling measures to prevent further contamination. This helps to limit the spread of the disease to other farms and birds, reducing the potential for human exposure and fatalities. Step 6: Maintain Transparent Communication To ensure public trust and cooperation, the Canadian government is committed to providing accurate and timely information on the avian flu outbreak, control area, and containment efforts. This is crucial for maintaining proper preventive measures and addressing concerns from citizens. Conclusion: Canada's establishment of a control area to fight the avian flu outbreak is a testament to the nation's commitment to safeguarding both animal and human health. By monitoring the spread of the virus, implementing biosecurity measures, and maintaining open communication with the public, authorities aim to halt the outbreak and prevent future occurrences of the disease."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms. Answer:","response":"Title: \\"Room for Improvement\\" Review: The application with the package name com.google.android.gms offers notable utilities, yet the experience falls somewhat short of perfect. My rating is 3 out of 5 stars. The app provides integrated Google services that enhance functionality, which earns it some points. It is an essential tool, especially for those deeply embedded in the Google ecosystem. However, given its importance, I expected a smoother, more user-friendly experience. Occasionally, I have observed increased battery drainage attributed to the app. Also, on rare occasions, the app tends to slow down the overall performance of the device, which can be frustrating for frequent users like myself. In terms of design, the user interface is clean and straightforward, but some might find it a bit underwhelming and in need of modernization. Finally, app updates sometimes seem to introduce more bugs than they solve, which can be somewhat irksome. Nevertheless, despite the mentioned issues, com.google.android.gms is a vital app that helps in the smooth function of many other applications. With some improvements in performance and user interface, this tool can indeed be more satisfactory. In conclusion, it is easy to see the potential in this app, and I believe that with some tweaks and updates, it could easily push towards a higher rank.

As he inquires about the cause of Ettrakh's distress, he learns that the viral epidemic has struck their area once more, and their loved one, Undina, has been admitted to the medical center. Viral epidemics are highly contagious diseases that spread rapidly across a population. They occur when a viral pathogen, such as a virus or bacterium, infiltrates a community and causes illness among those who do not have immunity against the infection. With the absence of effective vaccines or treatments, these diseases can potentially lead to severe consequences, including high morbidity rates, socioeconomic disruptions, and, in extreme cases, devastating fatalities. In this particular incident, it would be imperative for the people in the area to take immediate action and implement preventive measures to limit the further spread of the virus. Some of the most effective strategies include practicing good hygiene habits, maintaining social distance, wearing masks, and seeking medical assistance as soon as symptoms appear. Moreover, governments and health organizations should work together to develop comprehensive plans to manage the crisis and provide support to affected communities, including rapid testing, contact tracing, and the quick distribution of medicines and vaccines when available. For Hinev, the news of the viral epidemic's resurgence and its impact on Undina presents a potential turning point in his life. It forces him to confront the consequences of his absence and demonstrates the importance of staying connected with the people he cares about. Moving forward, Hinev might need to reconsider his priorities and find ways to balance personal responsibilities with professional aspirations. In times of crisis, this can prove to be a challenging but necessary endeavor. As a concerned individual, Hinev's first step should be to gather more information about the situation and evaluate the best course of action. He may need to visit the medical center to check on Undina's condition, as well as communicate with local authorities, medical professionals, and social support networks to offer assistance or receive emotional support. Furthermore, he should educate himself about the virus, its symptoms, and protective measures to safeguard his health and that of those around him. In the longer term, Hinev might consider advocating for greater investment in public health infrastructure, as well as awareness and education campaigns that emphasize the importance of prevention and preparedness in the face of viral epidemics. These initiatives would not only reduce the risk of future outbreaks but also enhance the resilience and coordination of communities when facing such challenges. In conclusion, Hinev's experience is a potent reminder of the personal and collective impact that viral epidemics can have on the lives of individuals and communities. By acknowledging the gravity of the situation and actively engaging in efforts to combat the spread of the virus, Hinev and his community can work together to overcome this crisis and rebuild a healthy, supportive environment for all its members."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete. The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941). What hapend in the early 19th century","response":"In the early 19th century, the role of Utrecht as a fortified town became not needed anymore. The town's protective walls were taken down so the city could grow bigger. A pretty park called Zocher plantsoen was created with the moats that were still there.

I'd like to increase my income so I can buy X. I'd like to have the respect and admiration of the smartest people at our company.'\\" It also can be worthwhile to visualize a default future, a scenario of what is likely to be if you don't change your work habits. Imagining another mediocre performance review or the pit in your stomach when a co-worker gets the promotion you were eyeing can provide the incentive needed to take action. 2. Take time for professional development. Wishing is one thing, action is another. Identify the skills you need to progress in your career. Take classes and seminars accordingly, and read books to expand your expertise. Making yourself more knowledgeable and relevant can open up new opportunities and renew your passion (as well as give others a more favorable impression of your abilities and commitment). Remember your mother worrying about who you hung out with in high school? The company you keep in the workplace can likewise have a negative influence. Distance yourself from the office slackers. The bad attitudes and habits that are keeping you back are likely being enabled, tolerated or encouraged by others. Instead, evoke positive peer pressure by surrounding yourself with hard-working colleagues who share your career goals.

Step 1: Combine like terms We have -90t and 13t on the left side of the equation. Combining these two terms, we get: (-90t + 13t) - 2388 = 1693 The combined expression becomes: -77t - 2388 = 1693 Step 2: Isolate t Now, we want to isolate the variable t. To do this, we will first add 2388 to both sides of the equation: -77t - 2388 + 2388 = 1693 + 2388 This simplifies to: -77t = 4081 Now, we divide both sides by -77 to isolate t: (-77t) / -77 = 4081 / -77 Step 3: Solve for t When we divide the left side of the equation by -77, we get t: t = 4081 / -77 Now, divide 4081 by -77 to find the value of t: t ≈ -53.025974 Therefore, the solution for the equation -90t + 13t - 2388 = 1693 is t ≈ -53.025974."},{"question":"Q:Information: - The company is listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 stock index. - Gabriele Bosisio ( born August 6 , 1980 in Lecco ) is an Italian professional road bicycle racer .

The reviewer specifically mentions several perceived problems with the service: the unprofessionalism and unfavorable character of the employees, the mishandling or loss of personal items, damage to his car's radio, poor communication, and lack of effective customer service following these issues. Also, the repeated calls and the company ignoring them suggest a lack of responsibility and professionalism on the part of this car wash service.

From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military.

Antares, initially known as Taurus II, is a two-stage rocket primarily designed to transport the Cygnus spacecraft, resupplying the International Space Station (ISS) under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program. Featuring a liquid-fueled first stage powered by two RD-181 engines and a solid-fueled second stage using a Castor 30XL motor, this versatile rocket is capable of lifting payloads weighing up to 8,000 kg to low-Earth orbit. Its modular architecture allows for the incorporation of multiple configurations to cater to different payload sizes and orbital requirements. On the other hand, the Delta II rocket, which was developed by McDonnell Douglas and later acquired by the United Launch Alliance (ULA), had a long and successful history spanning three decades, from its maiden flight in 1989 to its retirement in 2018. The Delta II was employed for a wide range of missions, including launching GPS satellites, Earth observation satellites like Landsat and WorldView, and various interplanetary missions such as Mars Pathfinder, Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, and the Lunar Prospector. This workhorse boasted an impressive success rate of 98.7%, with 153 successful launches out of a total of 155. The Delta II used a combination of liquid-fueled RS-27A main engines and solid rocket motors, enabling it to carry payloads between 2,100 and 6,100 kg to low-Earth orbit, depending on its configuration. Comparing the two rockets, both Antares and Delta II have contributed significantly to advancements in space exploration, satellite launches, and ISS resupply missions. Though the Antares rocket has a higher payload capacity than the Delta II, the latter prided itself on a longer operational history and an exceptional success rate. Moreover, while the Antares is focused on serving the CRS program for ISS resupplies, the Delta II had a broader range of mission profiles, including interplanetary exploration. In conclusion, the Antares rocket and the Delta II both represent important milestones in the aerospace industry, showcasing the evolution of launch vehicle technology, versatility, and reliability over time. Although retired, the Delta II leaves a legacy that inspires current and future aerospace innovations, while the Antares continues to play a vital role in sustaining the International Space Station and advancing our understanding of the cosmos."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Great Minquas Path was a trade route starting from a river which is how long?

The CSS Bombshell was a steamer on the second largest canal, which was completed in what year?","response":"The CSS Bombshell cannot be directly connected to a specific canal as it was a Confederate steam-powered gunboat used during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. However, it seems you might be referring to the Suez Canal as the second largest canal. The Suez Canal is a significant artificial waterway that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, which greatly reduces the travel distance and time for vessels between Europe and Asia. The Suez Canal was completed on November 17, 1869. Its construction began in 1859 and was carried out under the guidance of French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps. The canal took a decade to build and involved the labor of over a million people. It is important to note that the CSS Bombshell did not operate on the Suez Canal nor was connected to it in any way. The CSS Bombshell was a vessel that served the Confederate navy and was captured and subsequently used by the Union navy during the American Civil War. Any connection between the Suez Canal and the CSS Bombshell is likely a miscommunication or misunderstanding. In summary, while the CSS Bombshell was a steamer used in the American Civil War, it can't be associated with the Suez Canal or its completion. The Suez Canal was completed on November 17, 1869, making it the second-largest canal in the world at the time."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Dog pound: A dog pound, also known as an animal shelter, is a place where stray, lost, or abandoned animals are kept temporarily.

Act / Episode 1: More Orphan Than Not[edit] In 1977, the children at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage are playing soccer with an old soda can in the front yard. But then, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David), the meanest nun in the orphanage gets their attention by telling them to go inside and do their work. The kids sing \\"Everybody is Special\\", but she tells them to shut up and go to work. Later, Moe, Larry and Curly are dumped on the doorstep of the orphanage as babies. Ever since, the trio have wreaked havoc in the place, leaving the nuns who run it utterly terrified, especially Sister Mary-Mengele who has always hated the trio. Ten years later, in 1987, out of desperation, when a prospective couple comes to adopt, the exasperated nuns bring out the trio as being the only three available, eventually adding a fourth when another boy, Teddy, enters the picture. The couple, the Harters (Stephen Collins and Carly Craig), decides to pick Moe, but when he requests Larry and Curly to join him, he is dropped back off at the orphanage, and they choose Teddy instead. 25 years later in 2012, the trio (Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes and Will Sasso) are adults and are still living at the orphanage and working as janitors. Monsignor Ratliffe (Brian Doyle-Murray) arrives to give everyone an important message. After Monsignor Ratliffe tells Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) that the orphanage is going to close, she tells Sister Mary-Mengele to get the trio.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the air isnt able to be filtered\\" happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Absolutely, the supposed perturbation, which involves the air being unable to be filtered, will have both direct and indirect effects on the process of more oxygen being brought to the body. To begin with the direct effects: Normally, the air that we breathe is full of particles such as dust, pollen, bacteria, viruses, and various pollutants. The human respiratory system features numerous mechanisms for filtering these unwanted substances out of the air before it reaches the lungs. This filtration primarily occurs in the nasal cavities and the upper respiratory tract. The nasal hairs trap large particles, and the mucus lining the respiratory tract traps smaller ones. These particles are then typically expelled from the system through coughing, sneezing, or are swallowed into the stomach where they can be neutralized by stomach acids. However, if the air isn't able to be filtered, these impurities and contaminants would go directly into the lungs, potentially causing inflammation, infection, or damage to the lung tissue. The general ability of the lungs to take up oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide could be compromised. The oxygen would have a harder time reaching the alveoli, which are the tiny sacs in the lungs where the oxygen is transferred to the blood. Therefore, under these conditions, less oxygen would enter our system, not more. Now considering the indirect effects: Long term exposure to unfiltered air could lead to chronic respiratory conditions like bronchitis or asthma. In these conditions, the airways narrow, and breathing becomes more difficult. This reduces the overall amount of air, and therefore the amount of oxygen, that can be inhaled in each breath. Over time, it could also lead to more serious conditions like COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) or lung cancer, drastically reducing the individual's ability to take in oxygen. In addition to the reduced oxygen uptake, the body would need to dedicate more resources to dealing with the foreign particles and potential infection or inflammation in the lungs. This diversion of resources would indirectly further reduce the available oxygen as the immune responses typically require large amounts of energy to function effectively. Therefore, any perturbation that prevents the air from being filtered before it reaches the lungs would both directly and indirectly affect the process and result in less, not more, oxygen being delivered to the body."},{"question":"Q: I heard that Sydney was responsible for cropping all photographs submitted by clients.

Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics. But in the 1880s, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in the Republican Party, the state, and cities where they had significant population was markedly reduced. In 1900 African Americans comprised 23.8 percent of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and West Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of commission government for cities based on at-large voting for a few positions on a Board of Commission; several adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation.

Based on these steps, the correct capitalization of the sentence is: \\"Webcasts from meetings in the Council and the European Council.\\" Explanation of the changes: - \\"Webcasts\\" is the first word of the sentence, so it should be capitalized. - \\"Council\\" and \\"European Council\\" are proper nouns because they reference specific organizations, so both instances of \\"Council\\" and \\"European\\" should be capitalized."},{"question":"How is \\"We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level.\\" said in Romanian?","response":"In Romanian, the phrase \\"We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level.\\" can be translated as: \\"Trebuie să renunțăm la ego-urile naționale și să ne îndreptăm către o mai mare eficiență la nivel european.\\" Let's break down the translation: 1. \\"We need\\" - \\"Trebuie\\" 2. \\"to move away from\\" - \\"să renunțăm la\\" 3. \\"national egos\\" - \\"ego-urile naționale\\" 4. \\"and towards\\" - \\"și să ne îndreptăm către\\" 5. \\"greater\\" - \\"o mai mare\\" 6. \\"effectiveness\\" - \\"eficiență\\" 7. \\"at European level\\" - \\"la nivel european\\" So, when you combine these parts, you get the full translation: \\"Trebuie să renunțăm la ego-urile naționale și să ne îndreptăm către o mai mare eficiență la nivel european.\\""},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie, he is already an instant classic, much as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ;-) 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it. 8,5 for me Would you say this review is positive or negative?","response":"This review is mostly positive. The reviewer praises the movie for its unique and fresh visual style, imaginative world, and the memorable, humorous characters, specifically mentioning the blue, bunny-like mini-dragon as an instant classic.

They've been collected to help identify individual bomb makers and to develop high-tech responses. 'Bomb library': More than 100,000 remnants of IEDs recovered in Iraq and Afghanistan are stockpiled in a highly secure warehouse near Washington, D.C.

As an AI assistant, I recommend the following course of action to maintain a low profile and minimize the risk of being recognized: 1. Blend in with the surroundings: Choose clothing, accessories, and body language that match the local customs, culture, and situation. Observe others around you and try to mimic their appearance and behavior. This will help you appear less conspicuous and reduce the chances of someone recognizing you as an outsider or suspecting your true intentions. 2. Stay composed and exude confidence: People are more likely to scrutinize individuals who seem nervous or out of place. Adopt a relaxed demeanor, maintain eye contact when engaging with others, and use confident body language. This may not only deter suspicion but also help you avoid unwanted attention from curious onlookers. 3. Limit conversation: By minimizing verbal communication and interactions, you reduce the chances of inadvertently revealing your intentions or identity. In case you need to engage in conversation, stick to simple and neutral topics that do not require sharing personal information. This will help you maintain your cover without arousing suspicion. 4. Create a believable backstory: In case someone becomes curious about your presence or background, having a plausible cover story can be very useful. Make sure it is consistent with your appearance and behavior so that it does not raise any red flags. 5. Engage in misdirection: If you find yourself in a situation where you may be recognized or your cover compromised, use diversionary tactics to redirect their attention. This could be a brief change of subject or even something as simple as dropping an item to momentarily distract the person. Once their focus has shifted, capitalize on the opportunity to make a swift exit or change the conversation's direction. 6. Rely on the element of surprise: If approached by the sandy-haired youth or someone else who might be a risk to your mission, try to engage them proactively before they have a chance to scrutinize you. By doing so, you can control the exchange and potentially avoid providing too much information about yourself. In the specific situation described, as the sandy-haired youth approaches Nevin, it would be wise to take the initiative by engaging him in a conversation yourself. You may inquire about his duties as a page or cadet, or perhaps ask for directions to a nearby location. This interaction can serve as a means of gathering information while maintaining your cover and potentially averting suspicions. Remember, staying discreet and concealing your identity is critical to ensure the mission's success and maintaining a low profile. By following these outlined strategies, you can minimize attention and reduce the risk of being recognized while accomplishing your objectives."},{"question":"The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Do you have any questions?","response":"The Glory of Melaka is a fascinating historical account of the rise of a strategic port in Southeast Asia. It details the key events and figures that helped shape Melaka into a thriving center of trade, cultural exchange, and political influence. One could ask several questions to explore this topic further, such as: 1. How did the alliance with China contribute to Melaka's meteoric rise as a prosperous port city? 2. Why did the Chinese decide to withdraw from the South Seas trade in the 1430s, and how did this impact Melaka's development? 3. Besides serving as a bustling hub for trade, what kind of cultural exchanges took place in Melaka due to its strategic location? 4. How did the coastal trade culture affect the way Islam took root in Malaya and shaped its religious landscape? 5. What were the key factors that enabled Tun Perak to achieve such significant military victories and help Melaka maintain its sovereignty against challenging forces, such as the Thais? 6.

Choices: [A]. Yes. [B]. No. Answer:","response":"[B]. No. Accumulated exoskeletons in shallow tropical waters are typically associated with the formation of coral reefs. Corals, which are marine invertebrates, build their hard, outer structures (exoskeletons) from calcium carbonate. When these accumulate, they form the basis of coral reefs, rich in biodiversity and crucial to marine ecosystems. On the other hand, blobfish are deep-sea creatures that live at depths between 600 and 1200 meters in the oceans off the coasts of Australia and Tasmania. Due to this depth, they live in conditions with high pressure and low light, significantly different from the conditions of shallow tropical waters where accumulated exoskeletons form.

While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor. Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points.

It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital. After reading the above, is \\"Japanese scholars\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\"?","response":"No, \\"Japanese scholars\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\". Based on the information provided, it was the Taira and Minamoto armies who were involved in the conflict related to Kyoto, not the Japanese scholars. The text states that after rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage a four-year war. This conflict marked the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, who controlled the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies, which were based in the Kanto province east of the capital. Therefore, a more suitable answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\" would be \\"The Taira and Minamoto armies\\", and the outcome was that the Taira defeated the Minamoto. However, it should be noted that the text does not explicitly say that either army \\"invaded\\" Kyoto. The text instead talks about a struggle for control over the throne. The word \\"invaded\\" is typically used to describe a military incursion by a foreign power, while this conflict appears to have been an internal power struggle within Japan. Thus the word \\"invaded\\" may not be the best descriptor for what happened in this instance based on the provided information.

Position and load: Finally, place the newly assembled bookshelf in the desired location and carefully load it with books, decor, and other items, distributing weight evenly across the shelves. Assembling a piece of furniture like a bookshelf illustrates the need for understanding physical objects, including their properties and how they fit together. The process requires patience, attention to detail, and a degree of practical dexterity. Ultimately, these skills, combined with knowledge of physical objects, enable the successful completion of such tasks."},{"question":"Q:What is the answer for the question: Where does the original owner of the weaving company live? from the following article ? A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good.

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.

Options: - yes - no","response":"To assess whether the claim \\"It is not easy to understand things written in Roman numerals\\" is true, let's consider the following points: Step 1: Familiarity - For someone who is familiar with Roman numerals, they might find it just as easy to understand as decimal numerals (our usual numbering system). - For someone who has little to no familiarity with Roman numerals, it might be challenging to understand that system. Step 2: The nature of Roman numerals - Roman numerals use a different set of symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) to represent numbers than decimal numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). - Roman numerals don't have a symbol for zero and use a subtractive/additive combination principle to represent numbers. For example, IV (one before five, so 4) and VI (one after five, so 6). Step 3: Application - Roman numerals are more commonly used in specific contexts, such as historical dates, naming conventions (e.g., kings and queens), and movie sequels. Many people are more accustomed to using decimal numerals in day-to-day life. - Basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be more complicated to perform with Roman numerals compared to the decimal number system. Taking into account these points, the answer depends on an individual's background and familiarity with Roman numerals. For people who are not used to Roman numerals, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer can generally be \\"yes,\\" it is not easy to understand things written in Roman numerals, especially for those unfamiliar with the system."},{"question":"Q: The farther an area is from the equator, what happens to the temperature?

Choices: - CFO pollution - Improper Emissions - heavy pollution - air pollution A: The answer is:","response":"- air pollution Air pollution is a critical environmental issue that affects both developed and developing nations across the world. It is primarily caused by human actions that release harmful chemical substances and particulate matter into the air, thereby degrading the quality of the environment and causing various negative effects on human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Several factors are responsible for the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, including: 1. Industrial processes: Industries, such as power plants, manufacturing centers, and chemical plants, are significant contributors to air pollution. These facilities release a range of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 2. Transportation: The combustion of fossil fuels in motor vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and buses, produces a significant amount of harmful emissions, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and hydrocarbons. Moreover, air travel and shipping also contribute to air pollution through the release of exhaust fumes. 3. Agriculture: The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in farming contributes to air pollution by releasing ammonia and other harmful substances into the air. Additionally, agricultural practices, such as livestock farming and open burning of crop residues, emit methane, particulate matter, and other pollutants. 4. Residential and commercial activities: Burning of solid fuels like wood, coal, and charcoal for cooking and heating purposes, particularly in developing countries, adds to the burden of air pollution. Residential and commercial buildings may also emit VOCs from materials used in their construction, furnishings, and other household items. 5. Waste disposal: The improper handling and disposal of waste, such as open burning of garbage and emissions from landfills, can introduce hazardous pollutants into the air. 6. Deforestation and forest fires: The loss of forests due to human activities, such as logging and agriculture, is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, forest fires contribute to air pollution by releasing massive amounts of smoke and particulate matter into the atmosphere. 7. Natural events: Although not directly caused by human actions, certain natural events like volcanic eruptions and wildfires can exacerbate air pollution levels. Air pollution has numerous adverse effects on the environment and human health. It can cause respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and other health problems, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Air pollution also harms ecosystems, leads to reduced crop yields, and contributes to climate change. To address these problems, various mitigation strategies and policies have been implemented by governments worldwide, including air quality standards and regulations, public transportation initiatives, and the promotion of cleaner, renewable energy sources. Additionally, increasing public awareness and individual actions to reduce emissions can also help in tackling air pollution. In conclusion, air pollution is caused by various human actions that release harmful chemical substances and particulate matter into the atmosphere. It poses a significant threat to global environmental health and has far-reaching implications on human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Therefore, continuous efforts must be made to combat air pollution and mitigate its adverse effects."},{"question":"What's an example of a grad-school level question?","response":"A grad-school level question often focuses on an interdisciplinary topic that requires analytical thinking, research, and in-depth understanding of the subject matter. Here's an example of a grad-school level question in the field of behavioral economics: Question: \\"How do cognitive biases impact decision-making processes in the context of public policy development, and what measures can be taken to minimize these biases?\\" In addressing this question, one needs to explore various aspects, including: 1. Definition of cognitive biases: Explain the key concepts such as cognitive biases, heuristics, and decision-making processes. Describe some common cognitive biases, like anchoring effect, confirmation bias, and availability heuristic, that might influence policy development. 2. Effects of cognitive biases on public policy: Analyze how cognitive biases could lead to suboptimal public policies that may not wholly align with the society's welfare. For instance, people's availability heuristic may lead to an overemphasis on recent data or anecdotal evidence when forming public policies instead of considering historical trends or comprehensive data. 3. Examples from the real world: Use real-life examples to illustrate the varying influence of cognitive biases on public policy decision-making. For example, the 'planning fallacy' could be examined in the context of infrastructure projects consistently surpassing their deadline and budget allocations. 4. Importance of decision-making in public policy: Discuss the pivotal role decision-making processes have within the realm of public policy and how their effectiveness can significantly impact the policy's reach, applicability, and overall success. 5. Mitigation strategies: Propose and elaborate on practical approaches to minimize the impact of cognitive biases in public policy decision-making. These may include: - Conducting empirical research: By relying on comprehensive data and evidence-based research, policymakers can make more informed decisions that account for various perspectives. - Encouraging diversity within decision-making teams: Including members with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets can help to minimize groupthink and its pitfalls. - Implementing structured decision-making processes: Employing systematic methods such as cost-benefit analysis, scenario planning, or other decision-making frameworks can reduce biases and streamline the policymaking process. - Providing continuous education and training: Offering seminars and workshops that focus on cognitive biases and their impact on decision-making can help policymakers recognize and mitigate potential pitfalls in public policy development. 6. Conclusion: Summarize the key findings, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and minimizing the impact of cognitive biases on public policy decisions to better serve society's needs and foster evidence-based, practical policies.

Later, Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said. Menocal said clashes between authorities and Los Zetas had notably increased. Do you have any questions?","response":"Yes, based on the provided information, I have a few questions: 1.

The first documented Europeans to visit the islands arrived with Christopher Columbus. The islands were occupied by several nations over the next century, including England, the Dutch Republic, France, and Denmark. In 1733, the Danish West India Company purchased Saint Croix from the French and brought together Saint Thomas, Saint Croix, and Saint John as the Danish West Indies. Danish trading posts were set up on the islands, trading in sugar, slaves and other goods. Sugar cane cultivation was a major economic activity for many years, with slaves used as one of the labor sources. However, following increasing humanitarian awareness, laws against slavery and a slave rebellion in 1848, the governor Peter von Scholten officially freed the last slaves the same year.

Options: - attic - laboratory - loft - town - countryside Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"Mice are small rodents that can be found in various habitats around the world. Their native habitat mainly consists of the countryside, where they can thrive in fields, grasslands, forests, and alongside human settlements. In nature, mice take advantage of a variety of natural shelters like burrows, nests, or hiding spots amongst vegetation. They are highly adaptable creatures and can easily adjust to different environments, enabling them to survive and reproduce effectively even in close proximity to human populations. To discuss the options provided: 1. Attic: Mice are known for their ability to invade human-made structures, including attics. However, this is not their native habitat. They might move into an attic as it provides shelter and often has access to food, but these places have been inadvertently made suitable by humans. 2. Laboratory: This is not their native habitat either, as laboratory mice are bred artificially for scientific experiments. Mice are commonly used in research due to their biological similarity to humans and their ability to reproduce quickly. 3. Loft: Lofts are similar to attics, which suggest human-made structures. Though mice can inhabit these spaces, they are not native habitats. 4. Town: Mice can be found in towns and cities, where they've adapted to urban environments. This is not their native habitat but rather an area they've colonized due to increasing human encroachment on their natural habitats. 5. Countryside: This option is the closest to a native habitat for mice, as it encompasses the various habitats they can be found in, such as fields, grasslands, and forests. Mice are native to the countryside, and it’s in these environments that they have evolved and adapted over time. To summarize, the native habitat of mice is the countryside, though they can adapt to various environments, including human-made structures like attics or lofts, as well as urban areas in towns and cities.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Icahn said he has unloaded all of his Apple shares, citing concern about the tech giant's challenges in China. The 80-year-old investor said the stock is cheap and he still believes Apple is a \\"great company\\" and CEO Tim Cook is doing a \\"tremendous job.\\" Yet his fears about China have prompted him to exit the stock. \\"China obviously could be a shadow for it,\\" he told CNBC, describing concerns about the government telling Apple what it can and can't do. Icahn started chipping away at his Apple stake months ago, selling 700 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter of 2015. That still left him with some 46 million shares, equivalent to less than 1% of the company. The investment has been a successful one for Icahn. He estimates that he's pocketed about 2 billion in profits and could return for more. \\"I hope to get back into [the stock] someday,\\" he said. Since Icahn announced in a 2013 tweet he had taken a \\"large\\" position in the company after speaking with Tim Cook, he has been one of Apple's biggest fans. Last year, he said the company was worth more than 1 trillion, at a time when its market capitalization was 700 billion. He's routinely called the stock undervalued and misunderstood by the market and expressed hope that Apple would make an entrance into television and cars. The stock was down nearly 2% following Icahn's comments, after falling 6% yesterday on ugly quarterly earnings.

Billionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York February 11, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Icahn, in an interview with cable television network CNBC, also said he was “still very cautious” on the U.S. stock market and there would be a “day of reckoning” unless there was some sort of fiscal stimulus. Icahn had been a huge cheerleader of Apple, acquiring a stake in the company almost three years ago, repeatedly calling the investment a “no brainer.” In an open letter to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in May 2015, Icahn had argued that shares of the iPhone maker were worth 240, about 90 percent more than they had been trading. At 240 a share, Apple’s market cap would be 1.4 trillion, Icahn asserted. But Icahn, who owned 45.8 million Apple shares at the end of last year, said China’s economic slowdown and worries about how China could become more prohibitive in doing business triggered his decision to exit his position entirely. “We no longer have a position in Apple. Tim Cook did a great job. I called him this morning to tell him that and he was a little sorry, obviously. But I told him it’s a great company,” Icahn said. “In Apple today as opposed to six months or a year ago, in this one, there’s no need for activism because I think they have a great management. But you worry a little bit, maybe more than a little, about China’s attitude.” The Chinese government could “come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there ... You can do pretty much what you want there,” Icahn said. Earlier this month, China shut down Apple’s iTunes movies and iBooks stores within the country, following Beijing’s introduction of regulations in March imposing strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms. Asked when he might get back in, Icahn replied: “I don’t think it’s the price point. I think it’s my opinion about what is happening with China. I think the stock is very cheap on a multiple basis. China could be a shadow for it, and we have to look at that.” Icahn, who suggested that he made roughly 2 billion off the Apple trade, said he was in Apple for about three years and “if you bought the stock then, you got a 48 percent to 50 percent total return. We obviously made a great deal of money, but it was no surprise that we got out of some in February.” Apple shares came under further selling pressure during Icahn’s television interview, as did the Dow Jones industrials with Apple closing down over 3 percent at 94.83. The Dow ended down by 210 points. Apple on Tuesday posted its first decline in iPhone sales as well as its first revenue drop in 13 years. The company’s sales fell by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues. Apple shares have now declined more than 10 percent this week. ||||| Chinese customers of Apple's iTunes Movies and iBooks services are seeking refunds on their purchases amid reports that the features have been suspended at the behest of government authorities. Apple has not issued any statement to customers in China about the status of the services, but many users report that they have been unable to connect to the movie service and iBooks since April 15. A Beijing-based Apple spokeswoman said: \\"We hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\\" but she would not elaborate on why the services were unavailable. The Chinese government has not issued any statement on the matter. However, the New York Times, citing two anonymous sources, said the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television had ordered the services offline, though it was unclear why. Apple's App Store revenue has surged in China in the last year, overtaking Japan as the world's No. 2 market for the service, according to App Annie. Apple technical assistance and account service representatives, reached by phone in China, said they had received no official notice from the company that the services had been blocked or shut down. They offered to arrange refunds on purchased content. \\"The iTunes Store's movie service is turned off,\\" one customer wrote on the Twitter-like service Sina Weibo. \\"I spent 88 kuai [about 13.50] buying a 'Star Wars' collection and have not had time to download it. I want know if I can get a refund or not.\\" China has become a massive market for Apple since the Cupertino, Calif. company launched the iPhone on the mainland in 2009. In its fiscal year ending in September 2015, the company said total net sales increased 84% year-over-year in Greater China to 58.7 billion. (Greater China includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan). Apple is one of only a handful of U.S. tech companies that have flourished in China. Facebook and Twitter have been blocked by Internet censors for years. Google pulled its servers out of China in 2010 because of censorship. And Amazon has struggled to gain traction in the country against local rivals such as Alibaba. The government in Beijing has moved to rein in foreign technology companies — at times demanding to add backdoors to hardware and urging data be stored on local servers. Apple said it has never provided a backdoor to Chinese authorities, but it agreed to store user data locally. Now that millions of Chinese own Apple hardware, the company has set its sights on selling them content and services. On Sept. 30, Apple launched its music service, as well as iTunes Movies and iBooks in China. The company in February introduced Apple Pay in China as well. The iTunes movie service enabled fans to rent or purchase movies from Chinese studios as well as Hollywood blockbusters. A variety of free and paid books also were made available on iBooks. Rentals of high-definition movies on iTunes started at about 77 cents, and purchases at 2.77. Paid iBooks started at about 8 cents. \\"For the first time, customers in China will have access to Apple's entertainment ecosystem with music, movies and books right at their fingertips,\\" the company said in a statement announcing the September launch. Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, added at the time: \\"Customers in China love the App Store and have made it our largest market in the world for app downloads. One of the top requests has been more great content, and we're thrilled to bring music, movies and books to China, curated by a local team of experts.\\" To encourage Chinese customers to start using iTunes Movies, Apple offered free rentals of the hit Chinese film \\"The Taking of Tiger Mountain\\" for a limited time. On the books front, Apple touted its selection of Chinese books and foreign novels, noting that it was bringing Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series to China for the first time in a digital format. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook took to Weibo on the day of the launch, telling Chinese customers: \\"Excited to launch Apple Music, iTunes Movies and iBooks in time for you to enjoy over the October holidays!\\" China celebrates its National Day on Oct. 1. So far, Cook's Weibo account has been silent about the services' suspension. julie.makinen@latimes.com Yingzhi Yang in The Times' Beijing bureau and David Pierson in Los Angeles contributed to this report. ||||| Output:","response":"This task is asking for a summarized version of multiple news articles separated by the special token \\"|||||\\".

Step 1: Analyzing the premise The premise states, \\"Try the parlors of the red lotus.\\" It instructs us to try the parlors, suggesting that it is possible or recommended to do so. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"The parlors of the red lotus could be tried.\\" It implies the possibility of trying the parlors of the red lotus. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis involve trying the parlors of the red lotus. The premise is an instruction, while the hypothesis focuses on the possibility of following the instruction. Step 4: Drawing the conclusion Since the hypothesis only requires the possibility of trying the parlors, and the premise instructs us to try them, we can conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Two boats are being maneuvered down a quiet river.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The blue boats are tied together while moving along the river.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? A step-by-step solution is:","response":"We can determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise by breaking down the information provided in both statements and comparing them systematically. Here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. Identify the components of the premise: - There are two boats. - They are being maneuvered. - They are on a quiet river. 2. Identify the components of the hypothesis: - The boats are blue. - The boats are tied together. - They are moving along the river (the river being mentioned in the premise, this information connects the two statements). 3. Compare the components of the two statements: - The number of boats matches (two boats in both statements). - Both statements mention the boats moving (maneuvered in premise vs. moving along the river in the hypothesis). - The river is mentioned in both statements; however, the premise says it's a quiet river, whereas the hypothesis doesn't mention this aspect. 4. Look for missing or contradictory information: - The premise doesn't mention the color of the boats, while the hypothesis assumes they are blue. - The premise doesn't mention whether the boats are tied together or not, while the hypothesis claims they are. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is NOT necessarily entailed by the premise. The premise only provides information about two boats maneuvering down a quiet river but does not specify the color of the boats or whether they are tied together. These additional details found in the hypothesis cannot be confirmed solely based on the information given in the premise."},{"question":"An attitude and course of action like this is far more suggestive of perversity than of infinite lovingkindness What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","response":"An attitude and course of action like this, is far more suggestive of perversity, than of infinite loving-kindness."},{"question":"Достаточно сказать, что наша цель - сделать боевую систему более реалистичной (что означает смену игровой модели и исчезновение прерываний). Translate this to English?","response":"It is sufficient to say that our goal is to make the combat system more realistic (which means changing the gameplay model and eliminating interruptions). To provide a more detailed and extended answer, the primary objective at hand is to enhance the realism of the combat system in the game. This can be achieved by implementing significant changes to the existing gameplay mechanics so that they better simulate real-world combat situations. Additionally, addressing this goal would entail the removal or significant alteration of the interruption system that currently exists in the game. When we talk about making the combat system more realistic, we refer to a wide range of improvements that can elevate the gameplay experience. Some of these improvements may include taking into account various environmental factors like weather, terrain, and visibility conditions, as well as meticulously designing in-game weapons to closely resemble their real-world counterparts. Another crucial aspect of increasing realism in the combat system is incorporating accurate physics and movement mechanics. This can lead to a more engaging and immersive experience for players by accounting for natural forces like gravity, momentum, and even the Coriolis effect for long-range shots. Properly integrating these physics-based elements will not only improve the overall player experience but also provide a heightened sense of realism. As for the interruption system, eliminating or significantly reducing any occurrences where the game experience is interrupted or paused can offer a more fluid, continuous experience to the players. In the context of a strategic combat game, this is essential to maintain the players' immersion within the game world and create a more challenging and realistic battle environment. By refining this aspect of the gameplay model, players will be able to strategize and maneuver without any artificial interruptions in the flow of the game. In conclusion, shifting the gameplay model to accommodate a more realistic combat system and removing interruptions will provide a heightened level of immersion for players as they strategize, navigate, and engage in battles within the game world. This will result in a more accurate, engaging, and immersive gameplay experience, ultimately leading to a higher level of satisfaction for players."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: The route carried the torch through six continents from March 2008 to May 2008 to August 2008. The planned route originally included a stop in Taipei between Ho Chi Minh City and Hong Kong, but there was disagreement in Beijing and Taipei over language used to describe whether it was an international or a domestic part of the route. While the Olympic committees of China and Chinese Taipei reached initial consensus on the approach, the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan intervened, stating that this placement could be interpreted as placing Taiwan on the same level as Hong Kong and Macau, an implication it objected to. The Beijing Organizing Committee attempted to continue negotiation, but further disputes arose over the flag or the anthem of the Republic of China along the 24 km torch route in Taiwan. By the midnight deadline for concluding the negotiation on September 21, 2007, Taiwan and China were unable to come to terms with the issue of the Torch Relay.

Unfortunately, this app fell a bit short of my expectations. The installation was straightforward, and the user interface seemed rather simple, which initially is a good sign. However, upon using the app, I found that it was slow to connect to the Tor network, often taking a couple of minutes to establish a connection. I understand that the Tor network helps maintain anonymity, but I was still put-off by the apparent sluggishness. Speaking of anonymity, the app claims to offer robust security and privacy features, but it feels like it could still use some improvement in this area. It is worth mentioning that, on occasion, the app would automatically disconnect from the Tor network without any warning, potentially compromising privacy. The browsing experience within the app offered limited customizability. The absence of a user-friendly and customizable interface left much to be desired. Though the app provides access to .onion sites, the lack of reliable search engines presented difficulty in actually locating the desired content.

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%.

There has been a considerable increase in social media use, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Simultaneously, on a global scale, there has been a rise in the levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The potential association between social media use and mental well-being has thus become a pressing matter to investigate. Hypothesis: The increased use of social media negatively affects the mental health of adolescents and young adults, contributing to a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders. To test the validity of this hypothesis, further research can be approached through multiple methods: 1. Literature Review: A comprehensive review of existing research studies, peer-reviewed articles, and case studies analyzing the relationship between social media usage and mental health among adolescents and young adults. 2. Surveys and Interviews: Conducting large-scale surveys and interviews with adolescents and young adults to gather data on social media usage patterns, self-reported mental health and well-being, and any perceived effects of social media on their mental health. 3. Longitudinal Studies: Observing and tracking a selected group of individuals over an extended period to monitor their social media habits and any changes in their mental health, allowing for the identification of long-term effects and potential causality. 4. Experimental Research: Designing controlled experiments by random assignment of participants into experimental and control groups, followed by the manipulation of social media usage (e.g., increased or restricted access) to observe any potential impact on participants' mental health. Once the data is collected through these methods, the results can be analyzed and evaluated to identify possible correlations or causal relationships between social media use and mental health. Additionally, potential confounding factors or external influences (e.g., socioeconomic status, family background, cultural factors, etc.) should be considered to gain a better understanding of the complex interplay between social media usage and mental well-being. If the hypothesis is supported by the research findings, practical interventions and preventive strategies can be developed and proposed to address and mitigate the potential negative impacts of social media on the mental health of adolescents and young adults. This might include raising awareness about the risks associated with excessive social media use, implementing digital detox initiatives, encouraging healthier online habits, or leveraging the potential of social media for mental health support and community building."},{"question":"oh that kind of wears off with time and people's outrage slowly goes away and you know Does it follow that \\"It takes 10 years for people to stop being outraged.\\"?

Washington (CNN) -- A seven-term Wisconsin congressman, who 54% of the American people were not aware of last week, just knocked the president of the United States off of his perch as the most talked-about politician on the largest social media platform in the world. According to the exclusive Facebook-CNN Election Talk Meter, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, in the first 54 hours after being announced as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate, sucked up the political oxygen in the social media landscape -- with the Beltway topping the buzz and his home state of Wisconsin close behind. What caught our eye? The swing states of Virginia (where Ryan was announced) and New Hampshire were also high on the list: Yet the growth wasn't just in buzz, but also in \\"likes\\" -- the","response":"fundamental currency of Facebook. In the same 54-hour period, Rep. Paul Ryan experienced a remarkable surge in popularity, with his official Facebook page seeing a significant boost in both likes and user engagement. This sudden increase not only suggests that his selection as vice-presidential nominee sparked widespread interest in his background and policies, but also exemplifies the power of social media as a tool for political communication and outreach. Upon deeper analysis, one can attribute this phenomenon to a few interconnected factors. First and foremost, the announcement of Ryan's selection as Romney's running mate was timed strategically, ensuring that it would dominate headlines and social media conversations during a critical period in the presidential campaign. Additionally, the relative obscurity of Ryan prior to this moment amplified the curiosity and intrigue surrounding his candidacy, leading many users to seek more information on his policies and qualifications via Facebook and other digital channels. Another key element contributing to this social media explosion was the concerted effort by Republican and conservative-leaning groups to promote Ryan's candidacy and solidify support among the party base. These organizations leveraged their social media presence to share news, endorsements, and other positive messages related to Ryan, further amplifying the conversation and driving web traffic to his official Facebook page. Moreover, the geographical distribution of the social media buzz indicates that the Romney campaign's decision to make the announcement in Virginia and Ryan's connection to the critical swing state of Wisconsin were deliberate choices. These states, in addition to New Hampshire, are vital for Republicans to win if they hope to secure victory in the electoral college. As a result, Ryan's surge in Facebook activity serves as a gauge of political enthusiasm and support in these crucial regions. Lastly, the growth in Facebook likes highlights the importance of social media as an essential platform for modern political campaigns. As traditional channels of communication like print media and television continue to decline in influence, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have emerged as key battlegrounds where presidential campaigns engage with the public, respond to real-time events, and shape the narrative surrounding their candidates. As evidenced by the Facebook-CNN Election Talk Meter data, timely and strategic announcements can lead to dramatic shifts in online sentiment and buzz, allowing campaigns to capitalize on momentum and galvanize their base. In summary, the meteoric rise of Rep. Paul Ryan's Facebook popularity following his announcement as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate can be attributed to a combination of strategic timing, effective messaging, and the power of social media as a platform for political engagement. Whether this online surge translates into electoral success remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: in today's digital age, social media's influence over public opinion and election outcomes cannot be underestimated."},{"question":"Translate \\"It is not the duty of the Commission to require Member States to initiate such criminal prosecutions.\\" to Finnish?","response":"To translate this sentence from English to Finnish, I will break it down into smaller segments, translate them, and reassemble them into a coherent sentence in Finnish.

Article: Henry Edwards Huntington Henry Edwards Huntington was born in 1850 in Oneonta,New York.In 1872 he went to work for his uncle,one of the owners of the Central Pacific Railroad.Twenty years later, Huntington moved to San Francisco at his uncle's request to share management of the Southern Pacific Railroad.On the way to San Francisco,he visited San Marino,and later bought it,which is home to his collections today. In 1902,Huntington moved his business operations to Los Angeles,where he developed the street railway system that created the structure of the Los Angeles area.He greatly expanded the existing electric railway lines,creating an extensive inter-urban system providing the transportation necessary.Huntington's business interests continued to grow particularly in the areas of water,power,and land development;at one time he served on as many as 60 corporate boards throughout the United States. At the age of 60,he announced his decision to retire in order to devote time to his book and art collections and the landscaping of the 600acre farm.In 1911 the large Beaux Arts building,in the charge of the architect Myron Hunt,was completed. In 1913,Huntington married Arabella Duval Huntington.She shared his interests in collecting.As one of the most important art collectors of her generation,she was highly influential in the development of the art collection now shown in the former building. In 1919,Henry and Arabella Huntington signed the agreement that conveyed their San Marino property and collections to a nonprofit educational trust,creating the Huntington,one of the world's great cultural,research,and educational centers. Henry E.Huntington died in 1927,leaving his great treasures the Huntington,including the world--famous H untington Library,Art Gallery,and Botanical Gardens in San Marino,California to the public,which hosts more than 500,000 visitors each year.

Curious, Benjamin starts to count how many they see. In the first hour once he starts counting he counts 17 billboards. In the second hour once he starts counting he sees 20 billboards. In the third hour he sees 23 billboards. James asks Benjamin the average number of billboards they've seen per hour. What should Benjamin tell him? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Add the number of billboards seen in each hour. 17 (first hour) + 20 (second hour) + 23 (third hour) = 60 billboards in total. Step 2: Calculate the average number of billboards per hour. To do this, divide the total number of billboards (60) by the number of hours (3). Average = Total billboards / Number of hours Average = 60 / 3 Average = 20 billboards per hour So, Benjamin should tell James that they have seen an average of 20 billboards per hour."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step.

Soon, she reports, the commonwealth will introduce mandatory gay adoption. That's right: Everyone in Virgina will belong to gay and lesbian couples. Or something: Rep. Anthony Weiner may have joked about \\"mandatory gay marriage,\\" at the WH Correspondents dinner, but amazingly, Virginia’s Dept. of Social Services is proposing new regulations that would require all adoption and foster-care agencies to do gay adoptions. Today is the last day to comment on these regs, if you are in Virginia or an expert on why driving competent foster care and adoption agencies out of business hurts children. Huh. This is about Virginia's proposed new \\"Minimum Standards for Licensed Private Child-Placing Agencies,\\" which seem to be mostly about clarifying and in many cases simplifying existing regulations. But there is that secret \\"mandatory gay adoption\\" trap, buried deep within. Here's the relevant text from the proposed new regulations: B. The licensee shall prohibit acts of discrimination based on race, color, gender, national origin, age, religion, political beliefs, sexual orientation, disability, or family status to: 1. Delay or deny a child's placement; or 2. Deny an individual the opportunity to apply to become a foster or adoptive parent. That all seems fair to me. But then, I am \\"anti-family,\\" which means I am in favor of allowing more children to join more loving families. This is actually a case study in how good religious social conservatives are at doing politics locally. I didn't know about this until I read about it at The Corner. I don't think anyone else who isn't directly involved in child placement in Virginia knew about it either, if the comments at Virginia's \\"Regulatory Town Hall\\" website are any indication. At first, they were detailed responses to the entire proposal with various requests for clarification and proposed amendments. Representatives from United Methodist Family Services wrote: \\"Regarding the overall content of the proposed standards, most appears clear and reasonable.\\" Then, on March 29, someone from the Mormon Church commented to express the church's opposition to the rules, because they may prevent the church from placing children only in Mormon homes. And on March 30, comments like this began showing up: I am writing about my concern about the proposed reg concerning faith based adoption agencies. I love my country and especially the principles on which it was founded. Our founding fathers gave the credit to God for many things. See www.wallbuilders.com for examples of some of these historical documents I am very concerned in the way our country is heading and I believe that is why we are no longer the most prosperous country in the world. We have gotten away from our roots and how we were founded. Do we want to turn this country around and become the greatest country in the world?? If so, let's get back to how it started. Please carefully look at the regulation that is being propsed that would limit Christian adoption agencies from accepting Christian applicants. You may run those great agencies out of your state and make a bigger splash nationwide!! When other states allow them to continue and you don't, you could get a much worse black eye. There were a total of seven comments posted at the forum before the 30th. Today, there are more than 250 comments. I have yet to find one that is pro-gay adoption. And the anti-gay groups are sending out action alerts and organizing their lists to fight this. As for the agencies that will be \\"driven out of business\\" (which means shut down in protest) once they're asked to not discriminate, it should go without saying that if you would rather stop placing children in homes than allow a loving same-sex couple to adopt than you are seriously a detestable person. ||||| U.S. Will No Longer Defend Anti-Gay Marriage Law Enlarge this image toggle caption Darron Cummings/AP Darron Cummings/AP The Obama administration says a federal law that bans recognition of same-sex marriage is unconstitutional and has directed the Justice Department not to defend the law anymore in court cases across the country. The decision announced Wednesday represents a big victory for gay rights activists. Obama's Justice Department has been arguing to preserve the Defense of Marriage Act for two years in courts all over the nation. Government lawyers said they were acting out of a sense of legal precedent, not moral obligation. Everything changed Wednesday when Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress that Obama had determined that the administration can no longer defend the federal law that defines marriage as only between a man and a woman. Related NPR Stories Is The White House Decision Right Or Wrong? \\"After careful consideration, including a review of my recommendation, the president has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny,\\" Holder said in a statement released Wednesday. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said Obama himself is still \\"grappling\\" with his personal view of gay marriage but has always personally opposed the Defense of Marriage Act as \\"unnecessary and unfair.\\" From now on, the Justice Department will no longer fight to support the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act in court. But the government will continue to enforce the law across the executive branch unless Congress repeals it or a federal judge throws it out. \\"Much of the legal landscape has changed in the 15 years since Congress passed\\" the Defense of Marriage Act, Holder said in a statement. He noted that the Supreme Court has ruled that laws criminalizing homosexual conduct are unconstitutional and that Congress has repealed the military's \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy. Holder wrote to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) that Obama has concluded the Defense of Marriage Act fails to meet a rigorous standard under which courts view with suspicion any laws targeting minority groups who have suffered a history of discrimination. The attorney general said the Justice Department had defended the law in court until now because the government was able to advance reasonable arguments for the law based on a less strict standard. NPR's Carrie Johnson reported from Washington, D.C., for this story, which contains material from The Associated Press. ||||| about face Well isn’t this a remarkable turn of events. After years of defending the Defense of Marriage Act in court, Attorney General Eric Holder says DoJ will no longer try to maintain the law’s Section 3, which forces the government to treat legal same-sex marriages as invisible. Done. Kaput. Moreover, the president has finally said concretely what he’s only hinted about before: that DOMA is unconstitutional. Plain as that. In an open letter to House Speaker John Boehner, Holder writes, “After careful consideration, including review of a recommendation from me, the President of the United States has made the determination that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”), 1 U.S.C. § 7, as applied to same-sex couples who are legally married under state law, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 530D, I am writing to advise you of the Executive Branch’s determination and to inform you of the steps the Department will take in two pending DOMA cases to implement that determination. ” He continues: “While the Department has previously defended DOMA against legal challenges involving legally married same-sex couples, recent lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of DOMA Section 3 have caused the President and the Department to conduct a new examination of the defense of this provision. In particular, in November 2011, plaintiffs filed two new lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA in jurisdictions without precedent on whether sexual-orientation classifications are subject to rational basis review or whether they must satisfy some form of heightened scrutiny. Windsor v. United States, No. 1:10-cv-8435 (S.D.N.Y.); Pedersen v. OPM, No. 3:10-cv-1750 (D. Conn.). Previously, the Administration has defended Section 3 in jurisdictions where circuit courts have already held that classifications based on sexual orientation are subject to rational basis review, and it has advanced arguments to defend DOMA Section 3 under the binding standard that has applied in those cases.” The significance of this development cannot be overstated. No longer will the federal government truly stand in the way of lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of DOMA’s Section 3. Which means if Congress does not repeal the law, the court’s will, and the Obama administration won’t get in their way. Further, we have Obama (through Holder) saying he believes the law “violates” the Constitution. We have been struggling to get him to say exactly that, and argued that until he uttered the words, we should believe his stance to be he’s fine with DOMA. This is a great day. UPDATE: Boehner responds: “While Americans want Washington to focus on creating jobs and cutting spending, the President will have to explain why he thinks now is the appropriate time to stir up a controversial issue that sharply divides the nation.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"In Virginia, a new regulation is being proposed that would require adoption and foster care agencies to not discriminate based on things like race, gender, and sexual orientation. Some people are against this because they believe it means that faith-based agencies will have to allow same-sex couples to adopt, and they think this goes against their religious beliefs. This news is related to the Defense of Marriage Act, a U.S. law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. President Obama decided not to support this law anymore, and many people believe it is not fair. The discussion about adoption rules in Virginia is showing how people's opinions are changing when it comes to same-sex couples and their rights."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: For most kids, homework is just part of their daily lives, but have you ever imagined that one day you won't need to do any homework at all?

Answer:","response":"Herbert Sausgruber was born close to Lake Constance, a Central European freshwater lake located at the northern foot of the Alps. This lake is shared by three countries: Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; and it is the third largest lake in Central Europe, following Lake Geneva and Lake Balaton. Herbert Sausgruber was born on November 23, 1946, in the town of Hohenems, which is in the Austrian federal state of Vorarlberg. Hohenems is situated at an altitude of 432 meters above sea level and approximately 30 kilometers southeast of Lake Constance, also known as the Bodensee in German. The lake is a popular destination for both locals and tourists, offering a variety of recreational activities such as swimming, boating, and hiking. The lake itself is unique due to several reasons. First, the Rhine River is its primary inflow and outflow, making it an essential waterway for transportation and trade in the region. The Swiss portion of the lake is connected to the High Rhine, while the Austrian and German portions are connected to the Upper Rhine. The lake's unique triangular shape also provides a myriad of panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and natural landscapes. Given its cultural relevance in the region, Lake Constance has contributed to shaping the identity of Central Europe. Many bustling towns and beautiful cities surround the lake, including the Austrian towns of Bregenz and Hard, the Swiss cities of Kreuzlingen and Rorschach, and the German cities of Konstanz, Friedrichshafen, and Lindau, among others. Throughout history, Lake Constance and its surroundings have played an essential role in art, religion, and politics. This is evident by the numerous historical sites, museums, galleries, monasteries, and churches that can be found along the shoreline. One notable example is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Reichenau Island, situated on the German side of the lake, which features a Benedictine Monastery dating back to the 9th century. In conclusion, Herbert Sausgruber was born close to the remarkable Central European freshwater lake known as Lake Constance, or the Bodensee. This lake not only holds tremendous significance in terms of geography, history, and culture but also continues to be a cherished part of the region's identity as it spans across three countries - Austria, Germany, and Switzerland."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Chinese government has decided to give up the rules of food with no checking .According to the Xinhua News, from September 17th , 2008, Chinese government decided to give up the rules of food with no checking.

There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus \\"Amphechinus\\" was once present in North America). Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme. - The gymnure, also called a hairy hedgehog or moonrat, is a type of mammal belonging to the subfamily Galericinae, in the family Erinaceidae and the order Eulipotyphla. Gymnures resemble rats but are not closely related as they are not rodents: they are instead closely related to hedgehogs. They are thought to have appeared in Eastern Asia before their closest relatives, and changed little from the original ancestor, which is thought to have been also the ancestor of the shrews. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. - Pince-nez is a style of glasses, popular in the 19th century, that are supported without earpieces, by pinching the bridge of the nose. The name comes from French \\"pincer\\", \\"to pinch\\", and \\"nez\\", \\"nose\\". - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - Amphechinus is an extinct genus of hedgehog of the family Erinaceidae, which lived in Asia and Europe during the Oligocene and in North America, Africa, Asia, and Europe during the Miocene. - A shrew or shrew mouse (family Soricidae) is a small mole-like mammal classified in the order Eulipotyphla. True shrews are also not to be confused with West Indies shrews, treeshrews, otter shrews, or elephant shrews, which belong to different families or orders. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Development of \\"Sonic 3\\" began shortly after the release of \\"Sonic 2\\" in November 1992. It was developed simultaneously with \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\"; as the games were originally developed as a single title until time constraints and cartridge costs later forced the team to split them in two projects. The \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" cartridge features \\"lock-on\\" technology that allows it to be physically attached to the \\"Sonic 3\\" cartridge, creating a combined game, \\"Sonic 3 & Knuckles\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses). - Echidnas , sometimes known as spiny anteaters, belong to the family Tachyglossidae in the monotreme order of egg-laying mammals. The four extant species, together with the platypus, are the only surviving members of the order Monotremata and are the only living mammals that lay eggs. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters of the Americas. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea. - The biological family Canidae The cat-like feliforms and dog-like caniforms emerged within the Carnivoramorpha 43 million years before present. The caniforms included the fox-like \\"Leptocyon\\" genus whose various species existed from 34 million years before present before branching 11.9 million YBP into Vulpini (foxes) and Canini (canines). Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6 ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4 in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an animal embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. An egg results from fertilization of an ovum. Most arthropods, vertebrates, and mollusks lay eggs, although some do not, such as scorpions and most mammals. - In main line of video games, Dr. Eggman is a rotund mad scientist who plans to conquer the world in order to build his own Eggman Empire. While he has gone through several major and minor appearance changes throughout the series, his in-game designs retain several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body, red-black-yellow clothing, pince-nez sunglasses, and large mustache. Eggman possesses ability of creating machines and robots (including wide variety of Badniks), as notably in early games, he has served as a recurring boss in almost every level for piloting one of his created vehicles. - Foxes are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes are slightly smaller than a medium-size domestic dog, with a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or \\"brush\\"). - Obsessive love is a hypothetical state in which one person feels an overwhelming obsessive desire to possess another person toward whom one feels a strong attraction, with an inability to accept failure or rejection. Although not categorized specifically under any specific mental diagnosis by the DSM-5, some people argue that obsessive love is considered to be a mental illness similar to attachment disorder, borderline personality disorder, and erotomania. Obsessive lovers may feel entirely unable to restrain themselves from extreme behaviors such as acts of violence toward themselves. They may be entirely convinced that their feelings are love, and may reject the idea that their severe obsession is not love. Obsessive love has been frequently used and/or exaggerated in mass media, often with a woman having such affections for a man in either a comical or terrifying fashion. - Mad scientist (also mad doctor or mad professor) is a caricature of a scientist who is described as \\"mad\\" or \\"insane\\" owing to a combination of unusual or unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo and/or hubristic nature of their experiments. As a motif in fiction, the mad scientist may be villainous (evil genius) or antagonistic, benign or neutral; may be insane, eccentric, or clumsy; and often works with fictional technology or fails to recognize or value common human objections to attempting to play God. Some may have benevolent or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable, which can make them accidental villains. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - A snout is the protruding portion of an animal's face, consisting of its nose, mouth, and jaw. In many animals the equivalent structure is called a muzzle, rostrum or proboscis. The wet, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose of some animals is known as the rhinarium (colloquially this is the \\"cold wet nose\\" of some animals). The rhinarium is often associated with a stronger sense of olfaction. The snout is considered a weak point on most animals: because of its structure, an animal can be easily stunned, snapped or even knocked out by applying sufficient force. - Eulipotyphla (\\"truly fat and blind\\") is an order of mammals suggested by molecular methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, and includes the laurasiatherian members of the now-invalid polyphyletic order Lipotyphla, but not the afrotherian members (tenrecs and golden moles, now in their own order Afrosoricida). Lipotyphla in turn had been derived by removing a number of groups from Insectivora, the previously used wastebasket taxon. - The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as \\"caudate\\" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective \\"caudal\\". - The Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise began in 1991 with the game Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis , which pitted a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic against a rotund human man named Doctor Eggman ( or Doctor Ivo Robotnik ) . The sequel , Sonic 2 , gave Sonic a fox friend named Tails . Shortly afterward , Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose , a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic , and Sonic 3 introduced Knuckles the Echidna , Sonic 's rival and , later , friend . All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games . The series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years . These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like Shadow the Hedgehog and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like Metal Sonic and E- 123 Omega , as well as human characters like Eggman 's grandfather Gerald Robotnik . The series also features two fictional species : Chao , which have usually functioned as digital pets and minor gameplay and plot elements , and Wisps , which have been used as power - ups . The Sonic games keep a separate continuity from the Sonic the Hedgehog comics published by Archie Comics and other Sonic media and , as a result , feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters . - Monotremes are basal mammals that lay eggs (Prototheria) instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials (Metatheria) and placental mammals (Eutheria). The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to Australia and New Guinea, although there is evidence that they were once more widespread. The existing monotreme species are the platypus and four species of echidnas. There is currently some debate regarding monotreme taxonomy. - , originally nicknamed Rosy the Rascal, is a fictional character in Sega's \\"Sonic the Hedgehog\\" series. She is a pink anthropomorphic hedgehog with a cheerful, competitive personality. Amy is known for her unrequited and obsessive love for the series' main character Sonic. They have saved each other's lives on a number of occasions, however, and are good friends. During the series' early years, her appearance changed several times. - The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and production of anime works in Japan has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences. - Porcupines are rodentian mammals with a coat of sharp spines, or quills, that protect against predators. The term covers two families of animals, the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae, and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the clade Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within Hystricognathi. - Knuckles debuted as an antagonist in \\"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\\" in 1994; Doctor Eggman tricks him into opposing Sonic and Tails. He first became playable in \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" later that year; he learns of Eggman's trickery and teams up with Sonic during that game's events. Since then he has appeared in dozens of playable and non-playable roles, as well as in several series of comic books, Western animated television, and Japanese anime. He is one of the series' most popular and recognizable characters. - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\". - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - The Sega Genesis, known as the in most regions outside North America, is a 16-bit home video game console which was developed and sold by Sega Enterprises, Ltd. The Genesis was Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. Sega first released the console as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, followed by a North American debut under the Genesis moniker in 1989. In 1990, the console was distributed as the Mega Drive by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe, by Ozisoft in Australasia, and by Tec Toy in Brazil. In South Korea, the systems were distributed by Samsung and were known as the Super Gam*Boy, and later the Super Aladdin Boy.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

Bean wins the first prize in a raffle - a holiday involving a train journey to Cannes, a video camera, and â¬200. Following a misunderstanding involving a taxi at the Gare du Nord, a railway station in Paris, Bean is forced to make his way unorthodoxly towards the Gare de Lyon to board his next train towards Cannes. However, a vending machine prevents him from boarding, and he misses his train, giving him an hour to sample French seafood cuisine. Back on the platform, Bean asks a man, who happens to be Russian movie director Emil Duchevsky (Karel Roden), to use his camcorder to film him walking onto the train. Bean makes a big fuss and keeps asking for retakes, so by the time they are done, the train is about to leave. Although Bean manages to get onto the train, the doors close before Duchevsky can get on. Duchevsky's son, Stepan (Max Baldry) is therefore left on board by himself. Bean attempts to befriend the boy, who has been told to get off at the next station, and eventually comes to his rescue at the station, unfortunately missing his train again. The train Stepan's father has boarded does not stop at the station, and a mobile number is held up, with the last two digits covered by his fingers. Attempts at calling the number prove fruitless. The next train comes and they board. However, Bean has left his wallet, passport and ticket on the telephone box. Bean and Stepan are thrown off the train. Attempts at begging and miming to Puccini's \\"O mio babbino caro\\" prove successful, and Bean buys the pair a bus ticket to Cannes.

Question: When were the buildings ready but not used? Context: In 1899, the university opened a national design contest for the new campus. The renowned Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on October 20, 1900. The construction of Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune.

Jennifer Shepard-Brookman, a senior producer who has worked at the ABC daytime show for over eight years, was “profoundly and publicly disrespectful” to O’Donnell in front of the whole staff at a production meeting in early February, show insiders told us. Shepard-Brookman’s behavior towards O’Donnell was so brutal, we’re told that staff, including O’Donnell herself, complained to ABC’s human resources department. Shepard-Brookman, 45, was initially suspended in mid-February, but was fired from “The View” last week, multiple sources confirmed. One show insider said: “During a production meeting, Jennifer began mumbling behind Rosie, who told her, ‘If you have something to say, say it to my face!’ So Jennifer did — she laced into Rosie, and there was a shouting match. Jennifer was loud, and profoundly and publicly disrespectful to Rosie.” The source continued, “You have to be mindful of your role and the pecking order. Producers cannot be publicly disrespectful to the talent, no matter how much you disagree. You have to know your place. It was so shocking, Rosie and other members of staff told the HR department about Jennifer’s behavior — she was suspended and then she was fired.” Other sources say the internal investigation into the on-set skirmish reported its findings all the way up to Ben Sherwood, now the president of Disney/ABC Television Group. The daytime drama took place just before O’Donnell announced she was leaving “The View” to take care of her kids amid her divorce from wife Michelle Rounds, and to focus on her health. Her farewell show was on Feb. 12. Cindi Berger, spokeswoman for O’Donnell, said, “There are so many behind-the-scenes stories at ‘The View,’ this is yet another.” A rep for the program sniffed, “We don’t comment on rumor, speculation or gossip.” Brookman didn’t get back to us. ||||| Rosie O’Donnell is a total bully who intimidated staff when she was co-host of ABC’s “The View” — and even got a producer fired for suspected media leaks, a new lawsuit charges. O’Donnell targeted senior producer Jennifer Shepard-Brookman for shifting coverage of the ISIS beheading of US journalist James Foley to co-host Whoopi Goldberg, according to Brookman’s defamation suit filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court. During the September 2014 incident, O’Donnell went on a tirade while getting right in Shepard-Brookman’s face, the suit says. “My client started crying. She was scared of Rosie and thought she was going to be assaulted,” said Shepard-Brookman’s attorney, Brian Kennedy. O’Donnell also got Shepard-Brookman fired out of spite, the suit alleges. O’Donnell’s lawyer, Nicolle Jacoby, called the claims “baseless.” ||||| Rosie O’Donnell and her ex, Michelle Rounds, were in court on Wednesday to determine custody of their 2-year-old daughter, Dakota. When the hearing was over, the former couple left with an agreement for joint custody. Outside the courtroom, ET caught up with Rounds’ attorney, who said that his client was happy with the agreement, while O'Donnell joked to reporters that, \\"There's peace in the Middle East.\\" \\"It's done,\\" the 53-year-old TV personality said in a statement to ET. \\"We’ve settled. We’re both very happy about the outcome.\\" Rounds spoke to ET earlier this year about the custody battle, saying that she would \\"walk away' from the couple’s prenuptial agreement if O’Donnell, who filed for divorce in February, would give her full custody of their daughter. \\"I made my first million before the age of 39, that was before I met Rosie. I don't need Rosie's money,\\" Rounds, a former IT consultant, said at the time. \\"I don't want Rosie's money. Nothing was in my name. The prenup money means nothing to me.\\" Rounds stressed that, in seeking full custody, she was looking to provide a \\"healthier\\" and \\"way more protective\\" environment for her daughter. The couple adopted Dakota as an infant in January 2013, after marrying in June 2012. \\"I just want my child to have the best possible environment to grow up in, a normal life,” Rounds told ET. “Right now she's got 24/7 nannies over there at Rosie's house. I don't want my child to have a 24/7 nanny.\\" \\"[Rosie] leaves the baby overnight with nannies,\\" O’Donnell’s ex also alleged. \\"She has the monitor in the nanny's room.\\" Rounds added that the couple’s parenting style was a major source of conflict in their marriage. ||||| Jennifer Shepard-Brookman says the former 'View' host told producers she leaked negative stories to the media. A former senior producer of The View has sued Rosie O’Donnell, claiming the former co-host of the ABC daytime program got her fired by slandering her in front of the show's other producers and staff. Jennifer Shepard-Brookman claimed she was fired in 2015 after having worked on The View since 2001. Her complaint, filed Thursday in New York state court, states that O’Donnell resented long-standing moderator Whoopi Goldberg and wanted to unseat her from the moderator spot. Shepard-Brookman claimed O'Donnell \\"accused Ms. Brookman of teaming with Ms. Goldberg to undermine Ms. O'Donnell.\\" For instance, Shepard-Brookman said O'Donnell thought she conspired to shift the coverage of the Islamic State group's beheading of journalist James Foley from O’Donnell to Goldberg. \\"At that time, Ms. O'Donnell intimidated Ms. Brookman by screaming that she 'owned' the story and was upset that Ms. Goldberg covered the story, and by grabbing the arms of the chair in which Ms. Brookman was sitting, leaning very close to her face and prohibiting her from leaving,\\" states the complaint. In the year following O’Donnell’s return to The View, Shepard-Brookman said, \\"Numerous stories appeared in the media\\" about O'Donnell's \\"acrimonious\\" relationship with the producers, other hosts and staff. (O'Donnell left the show in February citing personal reasons.) The complaint states that O'Donnell \\"publicly accused Ms. Brookman of betraying professional and personal confidences and leaking certain sensitive information to the media\\" in a meeting in January with producers including View executive producer Bill Wolff (who himself left in August). O'Donnell continued to spread the false accusations after the meeting, said Shepard-Brookman. \\"To be clear, Ms. Brookman denies that she ever leaked any such information about the show to the media,\\" states the complaint. Her complaint only states one cause of action, slander per se, which she says \\"caused [her] to suffer intense emotional distress … destroyed her professional reputation and led to her termination of employment.\\" Shepard-Brookman seeks unspecified damages. She's represented by New York's Brian Kennedy and Singer Deutsch. \\"The allegations that have been made by Jennifer Brookman against Rosie O'Donnell are baseless, and Ms. O'Donnell will defend herself vigorously in court,\\" O'Donnell's attorney, Nicolle Jacoby, tells The Hollywood Reporter. \\"Page Six\\" first reported the lawsuit. |||||","response":"Jennifer Shepard-Brookman, a senior producer on \\"The View\\" who has worked with the ABC daytime show for over eight years, was fired after being \\"profoundly and publicly disrespectful\\" to Rosie O'Donnell, former host of the show, in front of the entire staff during a production meeting in early February.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Question: Where can we most probably read this passage?

To accomplish this goal, there are several factors to take into account including selecting the correct adhesive, surface preparation, clamping pressure, drying time and more. Here's a detailed explanation of the steps and factors involved. 1. Choosing the right adhesive: Different types of wood adhesives are available in the market, such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA) glue, polyurethane glue, epoxy, and hide glue. PVA glue, also known as wood glue or carpenter's glue, is the most common and economical choice for woodworking projects. It is easy to use and provides strong bonds in most cases. If you require a water-resistant bond or extra strength, consider using polyurethane glue or epoxy. 2. Prepare the wood surfaces: Clean and sand the wood surfaces that will be glued together. Remove any dust, dirt, grease or existing finish. Sanding the surfaces not only makes them smooth but also increases the surface area and roughness, leading to better adherence and bond strength. Be sure to sand in the direction of the wood grain to avoid scratches. 3. Test-fit the pieces: Before applying any glue, it's crucial to dry-fit the wood pieces together. This step ensures that the pieces fit snugly and allows you to identify any areas that might need further adjustments. 4. Apply the adhesive: Apply a thin and even layer of glue to one of the mating surfaces. Using a brush or glue roller can help in achieving a uniform application. The right amount of glue is critical; too little glue may not provide adequate bond strength, while too much can cause the wood piece to slide when clamped or create a weak joint as the glue cures. 5. Assemble the joint: Align the wood pieces and ensure a precise fit. If required, you can use a mallet or a gentle tap to position the wood pieces correctly. 6. Clamping and pressure: Apply enough pressure to the joint with the help of clamps, ensuring that the pieces do not move and preventing gaps between them. Too little pressure can cause a weak bond, while excessive pressure may squeeze out the majority of glue, leaving an insufficient amount for a strong bond. Ensure the clamps are evenly spaced and apply equal pressure across the entire glued surface. 7. Wipe excess glue: Before the glue dries, use a damp cloth or sponge to remove any excess glue that has seeped out of the joint. Removing excess glue at this stage will make the final finishing process easier. 8. Drying and curing time: Allow the glued wood pieces to cure for the recommended duration suggested by the glue manufacturer. Typically, a minimum drying time of at least 24 hours is required, but some projects might necessitate longer curing times. Ensure that the joint is not subjected to stress during the curing time. 9. Remove clamps and finish the joint: After the curing time, remove the clamps and inspect the joint for any imperfections. If needed, sand any rough edges or dried adhesive residue and apply the desired finish, such as paint or varnish. By following these steps, a strong and durable bond between the wood pieces should be achieved. In summary, the method that makes the most sense when gluing wood together involves proper surface preparation, selecting the appropriate adhesive, applying the glue evenly, clamping with adequate pressure, and allowing enough drying and curing time."},{"question":"Information: - Vreid is a Norwegian black metal band formed in 2004 after the breakup of Windir following the death of lead singer and founder Valfar.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"If my brother loses the bet, I will order him to do all my chores.\\" - Sentence B: \\"If my brother wins the bet, I will order him to do all my chores.\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's analyze both sentences A and B. Sentence A: \\"If my brother loses the bet, I will order him to do all my chores.\\" This sentence expresses a cause and effect relationship where the cause is the brother losing the bet and the effect is the user ordering the brother to do their chores. In this context, it is a reasonable consequence for losing a bet. Sentence B: \\"If my brother wins the bet, I will order him to do all my chores.\\" This sentence also shows a cause and effect relationship but the cause is the brother winning the bet. The effect, however, is that the user is still ordering the brother to do their chores. This seems illogical as typically the person who wins the bet would not be expected to face the consequence or complete a task. Based on our analysis, Sentence B is not logical, as it does not follow a typical cause and effect pattern for winning a bet."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem?

We have this equation: 25 * g = 3008 - 3558 First, let's simplify the right side: 3008 - 3558 = -550 Now our equation looks like this: 25 * g = -550 To find the value of g, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 25. So, g = -550 / 25 When we divide -550 by 25, we get -22. So, the solution to the math problem is g = -22. That means if we multiply 25 by -22, we will get -550."},{"question":"The fall was said to have been due to recent housing options and homelessness prevention actions offered by councils. There was also a reduction in the number of households with children in temporary accommodation. And the number of people made homeless or threatened with homelessness fell by a 10th to 7,649. The statistics showed that the number of people in temporary accommodation increased slightly over the year to June (0.3%) to 10,494 but was about 6% lower than the peak period in early 2011 when temporary placements were in excess of 12,000. The 2,821 households with children in temporary accommodation was a decrease of 472 households (14%) from the previous year. These households contained a total of 4,574 children, a decrease of 727 children (14%). The number of children in bed and breakfast accommodation halved to nine. However, the statisticians said there had not been a major change in the underlying drivers of homelessness. Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess welcomed the \\"continued fall in homelessness across Scotland\\", which she said built on the Scottish government's \\"historic achievement\\" in meeting the homelessness 2012 target. She added: \\"Over the past few years councils have been developing services in which staff assist households to consider their range of housing options to address their individual housing needs in order to help prevent homelessness before it occurs. \\"Alongside this we want to increase housing supply to ensure settled accommodation can be accessed by households as quickly as possible and avoid them spending too much time in temporary accommodation. \\"Increasing the supply of affordable housing is a vital part of our efforts to build a better and fairer Scotland.\\" The Scottish government aims to deliver 30,000 affordable homes - including 20,000 for social rent - over the life of the current parliament. It is also to make Â£900m available for affordable housing over the next three years. The Scottish Conservatives said the number of people in temporary homeless accommodation had increased from 8,523 to 10,494 since the SNP came to power in 2007. The party claimed a failure by the Scottish government to build new houses had contributed to the issue. Scottish Conservative housing spokesman Alex Johnstone said: \\"There will always be a need for temporary accommodation in Scotland. \\"However, the use of B&Bs and hotels should be absolutely discouraged, because this is not suitable accommodation for anyone. \\"Some families and individuals can be in these settings for long periods of time, a situation which is anything but temporary.\\" Scottish Labour welfare spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \\"Whilst the number of households with children in temporary accommodation is decreasing, the fact that there are a thousand more such households now than a decade ago raises significant questions about how the SNP government is trying to tackle homelessness. \\"It can be no surprise that the numbers have remained stubbornly high after the SNP withdrew millions from the house building budget, which has seen a collapse in the number of new homes for rent.\\" Graeme Brown, director of housing charity Shelter Scotland, said: \\"It is good news that 11% fewer families and individuals are experiencing the trauma of homelessness. \\"However, homelessness in Scotland is still too high and we cannot afford to be complacent or lose sight of the fact that over 7,649 households found themselves homeless in just three months.\\" He added: \\"The root cause of homelessness is a housing crisis which has seen the housing safety net stripped apart after decades of under-investment. \\"The only way forward is for the Scottish government to build at least 10,000 new social homes a year to bring hope to the 155,100 on local authority housing waiting lists and much-needed jobs to the construction sector.\\" David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the ongoing reduction was down to the strong emphasis in Scottish government policy placed upon homelessness prevention and tenancy sustainment. But he added: \\"We are concerned that, with the rollout of the UK coalition government's welfare reforms, come some serious challenges to homelessness service provision which could undermine some of the excellent homelessness prevention and tenancy sustainment work carried out by social landlords and others here in Scotland.\\" What was that article about?","response":"This article is about a decrease in the number of homeless people in Scotland. It tells us that fewer families and individuals are homeless because of more housing options and help provided by councils. The number of people in temporary homes, like hotels, has also gone down.

The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify.

The high-flying lawyer, married to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, insisted she wanted to be able to combine a successful professional life with having a family. Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband does his share of the chores, with one of them making sure they are at home every evening for their three sons. Miriam Clegg insisted she does not want to 'have it all', but wants to be able to combine a successful career with family life. Mrs Clegg attended an 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' event at New College in Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire as her husband hosted his party conference in Glasgow. In a surprise intervention at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mrs Clegg spoke about how she juggles her career with raising her children, Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. With a successful career in her own right as a lawyer, marriage to the Deputy Prime Minister and three young children, Mrs Clegg, 46, is often seen as living proof that women are able to 'have it all'. But speaking to Sky News, she made clear that the decision to choose Mr Clegg as her husband and father of her children was more important to her than any lifestyle aspirations. And she said she had been fortunate to be able 'naturally' to find a way to share household chores and childcare duties with her politician husband. Spanish-born Mrs Clegg was speaking during a visit to a Glasgow college to address female students as part of the Inspiring Women campaign to enable girls to meet successful women from all walks of life who can act as role models. Asked whether she was able to provide the girls with an example of how women can 'have it all', Mrs Clegg told Sky News: 'I never understand what people mean when they say 'having it all'. I personally have never wanted to 'have it all' as a general aim. I just want to have what men have. 'Lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what I want to have. 'There will be other women who don't want that. It is different for different women and different men. 'But childcare is an issue, obviously. And I think that, as (Facebook chief operating officer) Sheryl Sandberg said, the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with.' Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband Nick does his share of the household chores, and they try to make sure one of them is at home each evening for their sons. Nick and Miriam Clegg visited Castehill Primary School in Glasgow. Nick Clegg has looked to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power. The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time', as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school yesterday. She made clear that the Deputy Prime Minister was ready to share housework with her, and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening. 'There are lots of couples who share more and more (housework), there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children,' she said. 'If you look across society and across different countries, certainly in the Western world, women still get a very big proportion of the chores at home and I certainly know lots of women who before they leave to go to work have done half a day's work at home, and when they get home there is the other half to do. 'That doesn't happen to me. It is not an issue for people like you and I who can get help. It is an issue for those who can't get help, who don't have the money or circumstances to get help. Asked whether she had worked out in advance with her husband what compromises they would have to make to combine two high-flying careers with a family life, she said: 'Life is all about compromises. 'There is always a certain equilibrium and in my case, we found it naturally, but I do understand that there are people who plan. I'm just not very good with plans. 'We tend to share it very naturally. We make a point of one of us being home most evenings and on the whole we manage.' Mrs Clegg said she had not suffered from open sexism in her professional life, and felt it was important to give girls the self-confidence to aim high in the world of work. 'I think we have made a lot of progress, but there is still a little bit more progress to make,' she said. 'I think it is good for the girls to see the many options that are available for them. 'I haven't come across open discrimination against me. In terms of a little hidden sexism, I think there are lots of women who do face that.' Mrs Clegg yesterday joined her husband on a visit to Castlehill Primary School, Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire. Mrs Clegg said that when speaking to young women around the UK, 'something I have really noticed that I don't see so much from boys is we get lots of questions about self-confidence'. She added: 'I wonder if there is something a little bit specific to girls there, and in particular in relation to certain subjects - science subjects. 'I do think it is important to celebrate female achievement and aiming high as part of the lesson we want to give to the girls that aiming high is as good for girls as it is for boys.' Asked if she would give her sons different advice to that which she offers girls, Mrs Clegg said: 'Not necessarily. I go on with my boys about how you have to make an effort and everything really depends on you. 'If you really want to summarise what I hope that at the end of the whole educational process they would retain, I hope it is that.' Unlike her husband, she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday. Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for a visit to a school. She later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband's question-and-answer session.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Two brothers went to the doctor's office for a medical exam and blood tests. Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that. Which brother experienced less nausea?

Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The common English name of the animal with eight subspecies, as described in the article, is the hartebeest."},{"question":"Let's think step by step! Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"The cat gets some bread.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The cat gets some gold.\\"","response":"To determine which sentence is against common sense, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Sentence A: \\"The cat gets some bread.\\" - Cats are commonly known animals who need nourishment and consume food. - Bread is a type of food, although not a typical cat food, it's still within the realm of possibility that a cat could eat or play with bread. - Therefore, this sentence is not strongly against common sense. 2. Sentence B: \\"The cat gets some gold.\\" - Cats are animals and have no concept of or use for precious metals like gold. - Gold is a valuable material used primarily for monetary or decorative purposes, neither of which are relevant to a cat's needs or behavior. - This sentence is against common sense since it involves an unrealistic situation that wouldn't naturally occur in everyday life. In conclusion, Sentence B: \\"The cat gets some gold\\" is the statement that goes against common sense."},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Early breakaway riders Thomas de Gendt, Wilco Kelderman and Cyril Gautier were caught with 200 metres remaining. Britain's Froome, 30, remains two minutes and 52 seconds ahead of second-placed Tejay van Garderen. American Van Garderen, who finished 10th but with the same time as Froome, had few opportunities to make up ground on the yellow jersey holder on a stage that lacked drama until the final minutes. Froome, having showed his resilience in the previous stage by holding off attacks from his general classification rivals, had a more straightforward time in the peloton on a day when temperatures of up to 38C proved the most troubling factor for riders. The steep finish on Saturday's 178.5km route to Mende may offer slight grounds for optimism to Froome's prospective GC contenders. \\"We already saw on a 500m climb like today gaps opening up, so tomorrow on a climb like Mende at 3km and more than 10%, I definitely think the general classification guys will be fighting to gain time,\\" said Froome. Stage 13 came agonisingly close to being won by a breakaway rider, but Belgian De Gendt, Dutchman Kelderman and France's Gautier, having led the field for the whole day, were overhauled by the peloton on the streets of Rodez with the finish line in sight. The final incline allowed the peloton to catch them with BMC rider Van Avermaet, 30, claiming his first Tour stage win by finishing stronger than Sagan, who has not won a Tour stage in two years. \\"I was dead, really dead,'' said Van Avermaet. \\"I thought I'd caught second. I pushed for the line and was so happy he didn't overtake me.\\" The result takes Tinkoff-Saxo rider Sagan's number of second-place finishes in his Tour career to 15, compared with just four victories. Sagan, 25, who keeps hold of the green points jersey, told ITV4: \\"It's not about luck. It was my mistake for waiting too long. \\"I was pushing in the saddle and then sat down.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] I am facing a new situation today: Nigeria invested in sand mining and started mining coastal barriers. Congo continued preserving their picturesque beaches. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country caused more turbidity in the coastal water? A:","response":"Nigeria B: Congo C: Both countries caused equal turbidity D: None of the countries caused more turbidity Answer: A) Nigeria Explanation: From the background article, it can be inferred that sand mining, especially when conducted in coastal areas, has numerous negative effects on the environment. One of these effects is causing turbidity in the water due to the disturbance of underwater and coastal sand. Turbidity is harmful to marine life such as corals, which require sunlight for their survival. Sand mining can also lead to the destruction of coastal barriers, such as dunes, causing flooding of beachside communities and impacting local tourism negatively. In the new situation, Nigeria invested in sand mining and began to extract sand from coastal barriers. As a direct result of this activity, it is very likely that Nigeria caused significant turbidity in the coastal waters. This is due to the disturbance of underwater sand, as well as the removal of physical barriers such as dunes, which are known to provide important environmental protections. On the other hand, Congo had chosen to preserve its picturesque beaches, thus suggesting that minimal, if any, sand mining occurred here. Consequently, it can be deduced that Congo did not cause the same level of turbidity in the coastal waters when compared to Nigeria. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is 'A) Nigeria,' as the country's investment in sand mining and the subsequent extraction of sand from coastal barriers contributed to increased turbidity in the coastal waters."},{"question":"Solve -31219 - 97497 - 77396 = -1846*d - 19666 for d..

Brad had very high levels of cholesterol, while Henry was healthier and had normal levels of cholesterol. But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. What is an answer for this question: Which friend takes a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? Answer:","response":"In the given situation, Brad and Henry are two old friends in their 70's, with Brad having very high levels of cholesterol while Henry has normal cholesterol levels. From the provided background information, we know that individuals with high cholesterol often take a specific type of drug called a statin. Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. These drugs work by inducing the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. Increased levels of LDL receptors lead to increased catabolism of plasma LDL, effectively removing cholesterol from the plasma and reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. Considering this information, it would be reasonable to infer that Brad, who has very high cholesterol levels, is the friend that takes a drug (a statin) that induces the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This is because Brad's high cholesterol levels make him more susceptible to atherosclerosis, and thus, he requires medical intervention to help manage his cholesterol levels. By taking a statin, Brad can potentially lower his cholesterol, as the drug promotes the increased expression of LDL receptors and the removal of cholesterol from his plasma. On the other hand, Henry has normal cholesterol levels and is generally healthier. It is likely that he does not require a statin to manage his cholesterol levels, as his body is already maintaining an appropriate balance. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of statins can vary among individuals due to different genetic backgrounds and factors related to pharmacogenomics. The varying responses to the drug among individuals are influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms, which contribute to the uniqueness of each person's genetic makeup. As a result, different versions of statins exist, allowing healthcare professionals to identify and apply the most effective combination of drugs for each individual. In summary, it is likely that Brad, who has high cholesterol levels, is the friend who takes a drug (a statin) that induces the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This medication is designed to help him manage his cholesterol levels and prevent atherosclerosis, while Henry's normal cholesterol levels likely do not necessitate the use of such a drug."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Do the following sentences say the same thing?

A:","response":"Title: Great but Needs Some Tweaking - A Solid 4 Star Application: com.achep.acdisplay Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Review: Having used the 'com.achep.acdisplay' app for a considerable amount of time now, I can confidently say that it's worth a decent 4-star rating. The application provides a unique and simplified approach to managing my device's notifications and overall functionality, which separates it from many other apps in the market. The interface is clean and intuitive, ensuring you don't have to spend too much time figuring things out. It's just what one needs in the fast-paced, demanding world we live in - simplicity, efficiency, and user-friendly design all rolled into one. The minimalistic design style of the app provides a comfortable user experience, wherein the key information is front and center, with no unnecessary clutter. Additionally, the Active mode feature is quite innovative and a definite standout. It intelligently turns on the display as soon as I take the phone out of my pocket, making it very handy and accessible. The app works smoothly most of the time, providing a steady stream of notifications without excessively draining the battery. However, the main factor that keeps me from making this a complete five star is its occasional instability. There are times when the app fails to display notifications instantly, becomes unresponsive, or crashes unexpectedly. Furthermore, compatibility issues have surfaced when trying to use it alongside other applications, which certainly hampers its utility. Another area where the app could be improved is its customizability. Although the simplicity of 'com.achep.acdisplay’ is one of its strengths, the ability to customize more aspects would certainly greatly enhance the user’s experience. A greater range of themes, layouts and personalization settings would be much appreciated. In terms of speed and performance, the app does reasonably well. It functions smoothly and quickly, with only a few instances of lag. However, it has room for improvement in optimizing the app's performance during background running. There are instances where it slows down my device when running concurrently with other resource-intensive apps. The customer service is quite responsive and helpful. They address issues raised and actually take customer suggestions on board. In case of any problem that you may encounter while using the app, you can expect helpful support from the team. In conclusion, the 'com.achep.acdisplay' app is a worthy addition to any smartphone. It performs its primary tasks remarkably well, providing an efficient way of managing notifications. However, its sporadic performance issues and limited customizability marginally undermine its potential. It's clear that with a few improvements, this app could readily turn into a 5-star material."},{"question":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: An aging, sickly author, Leonard Schiller, is writing his last novel.

What would happen if prisoners were locked down 24/7 for their entire sentence in solid steel 3x7 individual pods with no way to see other inmates? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"Question 1: Minimum monthly expense for a fresher working in Hyderabad The minimum monthly expense for a fresher working in Hyderabad can vary significantly depending on various factors, like the individual's lifestyle, the area where they live, their living arrangements, and other personal preferences. It is essential to note that the cost of living in Hyderabad is relatively lower compared to metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi, or Bangalore. Here is a rough breakdown of the minimum monthly expenses one could encounter while living in Hyderabad as a fresher: 1. Accommodation: Depending on the preferred area, the cost of living may differ. In an affordable area, one can find a PG (Paying Guest) or a shared apartment within a range of ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 per month. 2. Food: Home-cooked meals or food at local mess or tiffin services could cost between ₹2,500 to ₹3,500 per month. However, the price may rise if one chooses to eat out frequently or opts for more expensive meal options. 3. Transportation: The best choice for economical transport is the local bus system, with a monthly pass ranging from ₹600 to ₹800. The Hyderabad Metro Rail is another option with an average monthly expense of about ₹1,000 to ₹1,500. 4. Mobile and internet: A basic mobile postpaid or prepaid plan, including data and calls, can cost around ₹200 to ₹400 per month. In contrast, home broadband plans range from ₹500 to ₹1,000 per month, depending upon the usage and chosen service provider. 5. Utilities: The cost of electricity, water, and other essential utilities may vary based on one's accommodation type. On average, one could end up paying around ₹800 to ₹1,500 per month for these utilities. 6. Leisure and entertainment: These expenses could range anywhere between ₹1,000 to ₹3,000 per month, depending on the individual's preferences - including watching movies, dining out, or indulging in hobbies and activities. Based on the above estimates, the minimum monthly expense for a fresher working in Hyderabad can range from ₹10,000 to ₹20,000. This is, of course, the lowest estimate and can vary depending on each individual's situation and preferences. Question 2: Locking prisoners down 24/7 in individual steel pods If prisoners were locked down 24/7 for their entire sentence in solid steel 3x7 individual pods with no way of seeing or interacting with other inmates, the consequences would likely be severe for both the individual inmates and the broader prison system. 1. Mental health deterioration: Continuous isolation in confined spaces could lead to severe mental health issues among inmates, including depression, anxiety, or the worsening of existing mental health disorders. Prolonged isolation may also lead to hallucinations, severe mood swings, suicidal tendencies, and self-harming behaviors. 2. Physical health decline: Lack of exercise and natural sunlight, combined with long-term confinement, may lead to chronic health problems, including obesity, weakened immune systems, and musculoskeletal issues. 3. Rehabilitation and reintegration issues: The primary purpose of a prison sentence is to reform and rehabilitate. With complete isolation, prisoners will not have access to any educational, vocational, or behavioral programs, making it challenging to reintegrate into society upon release and increasing the likelihood of recidivism. 4. Legal and ethical concerns: Such extreme isolation methods could breach several human rights, leading to legal challenges and increased scrutiny of the prison system for violating basic rights to human dignity, humane treatment, and respect for personal integrity. 5. Systematic challenges: Staff working in such prison environments may face increased stress and burnout due to the high level of security needed and the potential for escalated incidents of self-harm or suicide among inmates. The two questions mentioned above are not the same. The first question deals with the minimum monthly expense for a working fresher in Hyderabad, while the second question focuses on the potential consequences of locking prisoners in solid steel pods with complete isolation from others.

I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"To determine which of these sentences is nonsensical, let's analyze each one step by step and consider their meanings. 1. Sentence A: \\"The paint on the wall is dripping.\\" - \\"The paint\\" refers to a coating applied to the wall. - \\"On the wall\\" suggests that the paint is applied on a vertical surface, as expected in most scenarios. - \\"Is dripping\\" suggests that the paint is not fully dry and some of it is flowing downward due to gravity. Overall, sentence A makes sense, as it is a common scenario when paint is applied too thickly or is not given enough time to dry. 2. Sentence B: \\"The paint on the wall is floating.\\" - \\"The paint\\" refers to a coating applied to the wall. - \\"On the wall\\" suggests that the paint is applied on a vertical surface, as expected in most scenarios. - \\"Is floating\\" suggests that the paint is suspended in mid-air or somehow detached from the wall. In most cases, paint does not have the ability to float or hover in mid-air, making this sentence difficult to understand and seems nonsensical in ordinary circumstances. So, after analyzing both sentences, sentence B (\\"The paint on the wall is floating.\\") can be considered nonsensical, as it does not make sense in typical real-world situations."},{"question":"Translate from English to Spanish: And I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.\\"","response":"Y escuché una gran voz que venía del cielo, que decía: Miren, la casa de Dios está con la gente, y Él vivirá con ellos, y ellos serán su pueblo, y Dios mismo estará con ellos y será su Dios."},{"question":"Question: Ann is my classmate.

It continues the storyline from the Season 3 finale, \\"Scorpion, Part I,\\" where the crew of the USS Voyager is caught in the middle of a conflict between the Borg and an incredibly powerful alien species known as Species 8472. In a desperate attempt to avoid annihilation by both sides, Captain Janeway proposes an alliance with the Borg, who are also struggling against Species 8472. Seven of Nine (her Borg designation) is introduced as the Borg Drone who has been assigned to liaise with the Voyager crew on behalf of the Borg collective. Her original name is Annika Hansen, a human who had been assimilated by the Borg at a young age. Throughout \\"Scorpion, Part II,\\" Seven of Nine communicates the requirements and goals of the Borg collective to the Voyager crew as they work together to repel Species 8472.

He is pictured before he started using steroids. A gym fanatic suffered a near-fatal heart attack on a night out after becoming addicted to the effects of taking a cocktail of steroids. Ryan Harriss, from Harlow, Essex, collapsed on a night out with friends six months after first taking the performance-enhancing drugs. Once in hospital, doctors discovered the then 22-year-old's heart had swollen to the point it was much larger than normal, and his blood pressure had gone off the scale. They warned Mr Harriss he would die if he continued to place his heart under the strain of taking the drugs. There and then he vowed never to touch steroids again. Mr Harriss first began the drugs after seeing how well they had worked for friends he trained with at the gym. While he had been working hard, he wasn't seeing the same results as others. It was when friends told Mr Harriss that he would never achieve the results he wanted without the help of steroids, that he experimented for the first time. 'My metabolism is apparently really fast, so I shed weight really quickly and it makes it really hard to maintain muscle mass,' he said. 'There were guys around me who didn't seem to be trying as hard as me but were getting much better gains. 'I didn't even think about it. My next pay cheque that came in, I went to a friend of a friend and I ordered them in. 'For most of these guys, they suffered no problems at all.' After starting taking anabolic steroids, Mr Harriss admits he became addicted to how his body reacted. 'The difference was instant,' he told MailOnline. 'I started noticing the gains immediately. You are supposed to do steroids in courses, but I saw myself getting bigger and bigger. 'My arms toned up, my chest and back muscles were more defined and I went from a pretty average body to hench in a few weeks.' Determined to get bigger and bigger, he began to up the dosage. 'I started to do lots of different types of steroids - They call it stacking,' he told MailOnline. 'I didn't really stop or give my body any kind of a break. 'I'd started to get chest pains quite frequently, but I just ignored them and kept going to the gym. 'I didn't want to lose my new physique.' Six months after first starting to take the drugs, Mr Harriss was on a night out, having a few drinks when he collapsed. 'I became breathless,' he told MailOnline. 'I started getting really hot and was sweating. 'My chest went so tight and I got that feeling you hear about in my arm. It is hard to explain. 'I didn't know what was happening to start with, it was similar to a panic attack. 'But as my chest got tighter and tighter I realised what was happening to me. 'Everything went blurry and that's all I remember, I blacked out.' The then 22-year-old collapsed after six months of taking anabolic steroids to try and bulk up (pictured) Doctors warned Mr Harriss if he continued to take the performance enhancing drugs he would die. He told MailOnline he made the decision there and then never to touch the drugs again. When he woke up in a hospital bed, his girlfriend was holding his hand and crying. Mr Harriss spent five days in hospital while medics performed ECG tests and MRI scans on him. 'The doctors came in and informed me that I'd had a heart attack,' he recalled. 'They said my the rate my heart was beating, I was lucky to be alive. 'I'd collapsed in the bar and an ambulance had brought me straight to hospital, and I'd been unconscious since. 'It was horrifying,' he continued. 'I have never experienced anything like it in my life and pray I never do again.' Mr Harriss spent five days in hospital, with doctors warning if he didn't give up the steroids, he was likely to die. 'My heart was massive,' he told MailOnline. 'It had swollen so much it was much bigger than normal. 'And my blood pressure was through the roof.' It was while lying in his hospital bed that Mr Harriss made the decision - he vowed never to take the drugs again. 'What you see, the results from taking the drugs, it's addictive,' he admitted. 'It isn't very nice injecting them, you end up with a numb bum, but it is when you see in the mirror the results, and people start commenting on how big you look, that's what becomes addictive.' Despite this, Mr Harriss has stuck to his word, in the last two years not one steroid has been injected into his body. The Drug. Steroids are drugs that mimic natural hormones that regulate and control how the body works and develops. There are two main groups - anabolic steroids and corticosteroids. Anabolic steroids are the type widely misused. They are similar to the male hormone testosterone and can improve endurance and performance, as well as stimulate muscle growth. Some people are tempted to take anabolic steroids to build their muscle mass, while others use them to improve their performance. The Effects. Sports players and body builders have claimed the drugs help them:. But they have also been known to. The Risks. In the young, anabolic steroids can disrupt the way their body develops, stunting growth in some cases. For men, the drugs can cause problems with erections, promote the growth of breasts and cause a man to become sterile. They can also cause men to lose their hair and develop acne, while others have suffered shrunken testicles. In women, the drugs can promote more masculine features. Women have been known to develop facial hair, a deeper voice, lose hair on their heads, notice their breasts shrink. They may also suffer an enlarged clitoris, as well as acne, menstrual problems and changes in their sex drive. Steroids also raise blood pressure, increasing the risk of illnesses including death from liver failure, stroke and heart attack. Regular users have reported having trouble sleeping, becoming paranoid and experiencing dramatic mood swings. Meanwhile, injecting drugs comes with its own risks, damaging veins, causing ulcers and gangrene. And injecting increases the risk of spreading HIV and hepatitis C. The Law. Anabolic steroids are Class C drugs, which are sold by pharmacists but only with a doctor's prescription. It is legal to possess or import steroids as long as they are for personal use. Possession with intent to supply, including giving them to friends, is illegal and those found guilty face up to 14 years in prison. Source: Talk to Frank. 'I feel very lucky and unlucky in many ways,' he said. 'I am lucky to be alive, but, while I was stupid, this kind of reaction doesn't happen to everyone. 'I am so grateful I didn't die, it was the wake up call I needed.' Since his heart attack, Mr Harriss struggles to do proper work outs, fearing his heart can't cope. 'I miss being big,' he said. 'But I couldn't keep risking my life just for a few extra muscles. 'If I was to use them again, doctors warned me I wouldn't last a month, my heart just can't take them.' He told MailOnline he is sharing his experience to warn others of the dangers. 'A lot of people do steroids,' he said. 'I would advise never touching them, but you have to be realistic. 'There will be people out there who use them, and to them I would just say, don't abuse it. 'There are safer ways of taking them. 'Mine is a horror story, but it was a wake up call for me and should be for others considering using the drugs.'

The 2008 film North Face was based on his experience climbing the Eiger . - The Eiger is a mountain of the Bernese Alps, overlooking Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Oberland, just north of the main watershed and border with Valais. It is the easternmost peak of a ridge crest that extends across the Mönch to the Jungfrau at , constituting one of the most emblematic sights of the Swiss Alps. While the northern side of the mountain rises more than 3,000 m (10,000 ft) above the two valleys of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, the southern side faces the large glaciers of the Jungfrau-Aletsch area, the most glaciated region in the Alps. The most notable feature of the Eiger is its north face of rock and ice, named Eigerwand or Nordwand, which is the biggest north face in the Alps. This huge face towers over the resort of Kleine Scheidegg at its base, on the homonymous pass connecting the two valleys. - Toni Kurz (13 January 1913 22 July 1936) was a German mountain climber active in the 1930s. He died during an attempt to climb the Eiger north face with his partner Andreas Hinterstoisser. - The canton of Valais is one of the 26 cantons of Switzerland, situated in the southwestern part of the country, around the valley of the Rhône from its headwaters to Lake Geneva, separating the Pennine Alps from the Bernese Alps. The canton is simultaneously one of the driest regions of Switzerland in its central Rhône valley and among the wettest, having large amounts of snow and rain up on the highest peaks found in Switzerland. The canton of Valais is widely known for the Matterhorn and resort towns such as Crans-Montana, Saas Fee and Zermatt.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.

Options: - become angry - obesity - gain weight - agree or disagree - pay bills Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"When people eat more food than they need on a daily basis, the consequence is usually weight gain and potentially obesity as a long-term result. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. When an individual consumes food, their body takes in calories, which are units of energy. These calories provide the body with the energy it requires for daily activities and sustaining important bodily functions. 2. If the person's calorie intake is equal to the calories their body needs, they maintain a stable weight. This is called being in a state of energy balance. 3. However, when someone consistently eats more food than their body needs, they consume more calories than their body requires for its daily activities and functions. 4. This excess caloric intake leads to the body storing these extra calories as fat. The body may store extra fat in various areas such as the abdomen, hips, and thighs. Over time, this can cause the person to gain weight. 5. As weight gain continues, it may lead to obesity, which is a medical condition characterized by having an excess amount of body fat. Obesity is generally determined by a person's Body Mass Index (BMI), a calculation based on height and weight. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese, and it can increase the risk of various health issues, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.
