Another man then kills him with a sledgehammer to the face. A journalist, Carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing. Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling or too busy to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric's luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric's journal. Later in her home while reading Eric's journal, she has a dream of Eric with bloody eyes who tells her \\"leave me alone\\". Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric's journal. Although English is taught in the villages' school, not all the villagers know how (or are willing) to speak it. They see a man named Henryk butchering a pig then find a girl named Lidia picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl reacts at the sight of Eric in the picture but is hesitant to answer. Before she even can, Henryk calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village.

It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers.

Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity. The doctrine emphasizes the importance of personal empowerment, proposing that it is God's will for his people to be happy. It is based on interpretations of the Bible that are mainstream in Judaism (with respect to the Hebrew Bible), though less so in Christianity. The atonement (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession. It was during the Healing Revivals of the 1950s that prosperity theology first came to prominence in the United States, although commentators have linked the origins of its theology to the New Thought movement which began in the 19th century. The prosperity teaching later figured prominently in the Word of Faith movement and 1980s televangelism. In the 1990s and 2000s, it was adopted by influential leaders in the Pentecostal Movement and Charismatic Movement in the United States and has spread throughout the world. Prominent leaders in the development of prosperity theology include E. W. Kenyon, Oral Roberts, A. A. Allen, Robert Tilton, T. L. Osborn, Joel Osteen, Creflo Dollar, Jesse Duplantis, Kenneth Copeland, Reverend Ike, and Kenneth Hagin. Prosperity theology has been criticized by leaders from various Christian denominations, including within the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, who maintain that it is irresponsible, promotes idolatry, and is contrary to scripture. Secular observers have also criticized prosperity theology as exploitative of the poor. History [ edit ] Late 19th and early 20th-century background [ edit ] According to historian Kate Bowler, the prosperity gospel was formed from the intersection of three different ideologies: Pentecostalism, New Thought, and \\"an American gospel of pragmatism, individualism, and upward mobility\\". This \\"American gospel\\" was best exemplified by Andrew Carnegie's Gospel of Wealth and Russell Conwell's famous sermon \\"Acres of Diamonds\\", in which Conwell equated poverty with sin and asserted that anyone could become rich through hard work. This gospel of wealth, however, was an expression of Muscular Christianity and understood success to be the result of personal effort rather than divine intervention. The New Thought movement, which emerged in the 1880s, was responsible for popularizing belief in the power of the mind to achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health, New Thought teachers such as Charles Fillmore made material success a major emphasis of the movement. By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology. E. W. Kenyon, a Baptist minister and adherent of the Higher Life movement, is credited with introducing mind-power teachings into early Pentecostalism. In the 1890s, Kenyon attended Emerson College of Oratory where he was exposed to the New Thought movement. Kenyon later became connected with well-known Pentecostal leaders and wrote about supernatural revelation and positive declarations. His writing influenced leaders of the nascent prosperity movement during the post-war American healing revival. Kenyon and later leaders in the prosperity movement have denied that he was influenced by the New Thought movement. Anthropologist Simon Coleman argues that there are \\"obvious parallels\\" between Kenyon's teachings and New Thought. Kenyon taught that Christ's substitutionary atonement secured for believers a right to divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it. Kenyon's blend of evangelical religion and mind-power beliefs—what he termed \\"overcoming faith\\"—resonated with a small but influential segment of the Pentecostal movement. Pentecostals had always been committed to faith healing, and the movement also possessed a strong belief in the power of speech (in particular speaking in tongues and the use of the names of God, especially the name of Jesus). Kenyon's ideas would be reflected in the teachings of Pentecostal evangelists F. F. Bosworth and John G. Lake (who co-led a congregation with New Thought author Albert C. Grier prior to 1915). Postwar Healing Revivals [ edit ] While Kenyon's teachings on overcoming faith laid the groundwork for the prosperity gospel, the first generation of Pentecostals influenced by him and other figures, such as Bosworth, did not view faith as a means to attain material prosperity. In fact, early Pentecostals tended to view prosperity as a threat to a person's spiritual well-being. By the 1940s and 1950s, however, a recognizable form of the doctrine began to take shape within the Pentecostal movement through the teachings of deliverance and healing evangelists. Combining prosperity teaching with revivalism and faith healing, these evangelists taught \\"the laws of faith ('ask and ye shall receive') and the laws of divine reciprocity ('give and it will be given back unto you')\\". Oral Roberts began teaching prosperity theology in 1947. He explained the laws of faith as a \\"blessing pact\\" in which God would return donations \\"seven fold\\", promising that donors would receive back from unexpected sources the money they donated to him. Roberts offered to return any donation that did not lead to an equivalent unexpected payment. In the 1970s, Roberts characterized his blessing pact teaching as the \\"seed faith\\" doctrine: donations were a form of \\"seed\\" which would grow in value and be returned to the donor. Roberts began recruiting \\"partners\\", wealthy donors who received exclusive conference invitations and ministry access in exchange for support. In 1953, faith healer A. A. Allen published The Secret to Scriptural Financial Success and promoted merchandise such as \\"miracle tent shavings\\" and prayer cloths anointed with \\"miracle oil\\". In the late 1950s, Allen increasingly focused on prosperity. He taught that faith could miraculously solve financial problems and claimed to have had a miraculous experience in which God supernaturally changed one-dollar bills into twenty-dollar bills to allow him to pay his debts. Allen taught the \\"word of faith\\" or the power to speak something into being. In the 1960s, prosperity became a primary focus in healing revivals. T. L. Osborn began emphasizing prosperity in the 1960s and became known for his often ostentatious displays of personal wealth. During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted in part by the expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists. Televangelism [ edit ] During the 1960s, prosperity gospel teachers embraced televangelism and came to dominate religious programming in the United States. Oral Roberts was among the first, developing a syndicated weekly program that became the most watched religious show in the United States. By 1968, television had supplanted the tent meeting in his ministry. Reverend Ike, a pastor from New York City, began preaching about prosperity in the late 1960s. He soon had widely aired radio and television programs and became distinguished for his flashy style. His openness about love for material possessions and teachings about the \\"Science of the Mind\\" led many evangelists to distance themselves from him. In the 1980s, public attention in the United States was drawn to prosperity theology through the influence of prominent televangelists such as Jim Bakker. Bakker's influence waned, however, after he was implicated in a high-profile scandal.[29][C] In the aftermath, Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) emerged as the dominant force in prosperity televangelism, having brought Robert Tilton and Benny Hinn to prominence. Word of Faith [ edit ] Although nearly all of the healing evangelists of the 1940s and 1950s taught that faith could bring financial rewards, a new prosperity-oriented teaching developed in the 1970s that differed from the one taught by Pentecostal evangelists of the 1950s. This \\"Positive Confession\\" or \\"Word of Faith\\" movement taught that a Christian with faith can speak into existence anything consistent with the will of God. Kenneth Hagin was credited with a key role in the expansion of prosperity theology. He founded the RHEMA Bible Training Center in 1974, and over the next 20 years, the school trained more than 10,000 students in his theology. As is true of other prosperity movements, there is no theological governing body for the Word of Faith movement, and well-known ministries differ on some theological issues. The teachings of Kenneth Hagin have been described by Candy Gunther Brown of Indiana University as the most \\"orthodox\\" form of Word of Faith prosperity teaching. International growth [ edit ] By the late 2000s, proponents claimed that tens of millions of Christians had accepted prosperity theology.[36] The Neo-Pentecostal movement has been characterized in part by an emphasis on prosperity theology, which gained greater acceptance within charismatic Christianity during the late 1990s. In the 2000s, churches teaching prosperity theology saw significant growth in the Third World. According to Philip Jenkins of Pennsylvania State University, poor citizens of impoverished countries often find the doctrine appealing because of their economic powerlessness and the doctrine's emphasis on miracles. One region seeing explosive growth is Western Africa, particularly Nigeria. In the Philippines, the El Shaddai movement, part of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, has spread prosperity theology outside Protestant Christianity. One South Korean prosperity church, Yoido Full Gospel Church, gained attention in the 1990s by claiming to be the world's largest congregation. A 2006 poll by Time reported that 17% of Christians in America said they identified with the movement.[29] By the 2000s, adherents of prosperity theology in the United States were most common in the Sun Belt.[36] By 2006, three of the four largest congregations in the United States were teaching prosperity theology, and Joel Osteen has been credited with spreading it outside of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movement through his books, which have sold over 4 million copies.[29][D] Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez also sold millions of copies and invited readers to seek prosperity. There is no official governing body for the movement, though many ministries are unofficially linked. Recent history [ edit ] In 2005, Matthew Ashimolowo, the founder of the largely African Kingsway International Christian Centre in southern England, which preaches a \\"health and wealth\\" gospel and collects regular tithes, was ordered by the Charity Commission to repay money he had appropriated for his personal use. In 2017, the organisation was under criminal investigation after a leading member was found by a court in 2015 to have operated a Ponzi scheme between 2007 and 2011, losing or spending £8 million of investors' money.[43] In 2007, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley opened a probe into the finances of six televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Creflo Dollar Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, Bishop Eddie Long Ministries, Joyce Meyer Ministries, and Paula White Ministries. In January 2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating that he believed self-regulation by religious organizations was preferable to government action.[44][E] Only the ministries led by Meyer and Hinn cooperated with Grassley's investigation.[44] The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States featured prayers from two preachers known for advocating prosperity theology.[45] Paula White, one of Trump's spiritual advisers, gave the invocation.[46] Theology [ edit ] Prosperity theology teaches that Christians are entitled to well-being and, because physical and spiritual realities are seen as one inseparable reality, this is interpreted as physical health and economic prosperity. Teachers of the doctrine focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they are made in the image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.[29][B] Wealth is interpreted in prosperity theology as a blessing from God, obtained through a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations. This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms; Kenneth Copeland, an American author and televangelist, argues that prosperity is governed by laws, while other teachers portray the process formulaically. Journalists David van Biema and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor Creflo Dollar's teachings about prosperity as an inviolable contract between God and humanity.[29] The prosperity theology teaching of positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible is seen as a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality. The teaching is often based on non-traditional interpretations of Bible verses, the Book of Malachi often being given special attention. While Malachi has generally been celebrated by Christians for its passages about the messiah, teachers of prosperity theology usually draw attention to its descriptions of physical wealth. Frequently quoted verses include: Prosperity theology casts itself as the reclamation of true doctrine and thus part of a path to Christian dominion over secular society. It contends that God's promises of prosperity and victory to Israel in the Old Testament apply to New-Covenant Christians today, and that faith and holy actions release this prosperity. C. Peter Wagner, a leader of the New Apostolic Reformation, has argued that if Christians take dominion over aspects of society, the Earth will experience \\"peace and prosperity\\".[53] Some Latin Americans who have embraced prosperity theology argue that Christianity has historically placed an unnecessary focus on suffering. They often view this as a Roman Catholic doctrine that should be discarded and replaced with an emphasis on prosperity. Prosperity theology advocates also argue that biblical promises of blessings awaiting the poor have been unnecessarily spiritualized, and should be understood literally. Practices [ edit ] Prosperity churches place a strong emphasis on the importance of giving. Some services include a teaching time focused on giving and prosperity, including Biblical references to tithing; and then a sermon on another topic which follows the offering. Prosperity church leaders often claim a specific blessing can be exchanged for the money being donated to their ministry; some have been reported to instruct worshipers to hold their donations above their heads during the prayer. Congregants in prosperity churches are encouraged to speak positive statements about aspects of their lives that they wish to see improved. These statements, known as positive confessions (distinct from confessions of sin), are said to miraculously change aspects of people's lives if spoken with faith. Prosperity churches also encourage people to \\"live without limits\\" and cultivate optimism about their lives. T. D. Jakes, pastor of The Potter's House non-denominational mega-church, has argued in favor of prosperity, rejecting what he sees as the demonization of success. He views poverty as a barrier to living a Christian life, suggesting that it is easier to make a positive impact on society when one is affluent. While some prosperity churches have a reputation for manipulating and alienating the poor, many are involved in social programs. Underlying these programs is a theology of empowerment and human flourishing with the goal of releasing people from a \\"welfare\\" or \\"victim\\" mentality. Many prosperity churches hold seminars on financial responsibility. Kate Bowler, an academic who studies prosperity theology, has criticized such seminars, arguing that though they contain some sound advice the seminars often emphasize the purchase of expensive possessions.[36] Hanna Rosin of The Atlantic argues that prosperity theology contributed to the housing bubble that caused the late-2000s financial crisis. She maintains that home ownership was heavily emphasized in prosperity churches, based on reliance on divine financial intervention that led to unwise choices based on actual financial ability.[36] Most churches in the prosperity movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject presbyterian polity (or governance) and the idea that a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors. Reception [ edit ] Socioeconomic analysis [ edit ] In the United States, the movement has drawn many followers from the middle class and is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas.[36] In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that the movement was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s.[G] Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny,[36] the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power. Prosperity theology has become popular among poor Americans, particularly those who seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants.[36] Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views.[29] Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to the fact that it promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians. In a 1998 interview in Christianity Today, Bong Rin Ro of the Asia Graduate School of Theology suggested that the growth in popularity of prosperity theology in South Korea reflects a strong \\"shamanistic influence\\". Bong pointed to parallels between the tradition of paying shamans for healing and the prosperity theology's contractual doctrine about giving and blessings. Asia's economic problems, he argued, encouraged the growth of the doctrine in South Korea, though he claims it ignores the poor and needy. During the interview, he stated that he saw the problem beginning to be reversed, citing calls for renewed faith and other practices.[67] Cho Yong-gi, pastor of Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, has been criticized for shamanising Christianity. This criticism has focused on his healing and exorcism ministries and his promise of material blessings. Malaysian Christian writer Hwa Yung has defended Cho's healing and exorcism ministries, arguing that he successfully contextualized the Gospel in a culture where shamanism was still prevalent. However, Hwa criticizes Cho's teaching of earthly blessings for not reflecting a trust in God's daily provision and for their heavy focus on earthly wealth. Comparisons with other movements [ edit ] Historian Carter Lindberg of Boston University has drawn parallels between contemporary prosperity theology and the medieval indulgence trade. Coleman notes that several pre–20th century Christian movements in the United States taught that a holy lifestyle was a path to prosperity and that God-ordained hard work would bring blessing. Coleman has speculated that modern-day prosperity theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though he admits that the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change. Criticism [ edit ] Mainstream evangelicalism has consistently opposed prosperity theology as heresy[36] and prosperity ministries have frequently come into conflict with other Christian groups, including those within the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. Critics, such as Evangelical pastor Michael Catt, have argued that prosperity theology has little in common with traditional Christian theology.[73] Prominent evangelical leaders, such as Rick Warren,[29] Ben Witherington III,[29] and Jerry Falwell,[74] have harshly criticized the movement, sometimes denouncing it as heretical.[29] Warren proposes that prosperity theology promotes the idolatry of money, and others argue that Jesus' teachings indicate a disdain for material wealth.[29] In Mark: Jesus, Servant and Savior, R. Kent Hughes notes that some 1st-century rabbis portrayed material blessings as a sign of God's favor. He cites Jesus' statement in Mark 10:25 that \\"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\\" (KJV) as evidence to oppose such thinking. Other critics of the movement assail promises made by its leaders, arguing that the broad freedom from problems they promise is irresponsible. Televangelists are often criticized for abusing the faith of their listeners by enriching themselves through large donations.[76] Prosperity theology has been opposed for not adequately explaining the poverty of the Apostles. For instance, some theologians believe that the life and writings of Paul the Apostle, who is believed to have experienced significant suffering during his ministry, are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology. Cathleen Falsani, religion writer in an opinion piece in The Washington Post, points to the conflict with basic Christian teachings \\"Jesus was born poor, and he died poor. During his earthly tenure, he spoke time and again about the importance of spiritual wealth and health. When he talked about material wealth, it was usually part of a cautionary tale.\\"[78] In their book Health, Wealth and Happiness, theologians David Jones and Russell Woodbridge characterize the doctrine as poor theology. They suggest that righteousness cannot be earned and that the Bible does not promise an easy life. They argue that it is inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus and propose that the central message of the gospel should be Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Jones and Woodbridge see Jesus' importance as vital, criticizing the prosperity gospel for marginalizing him in favor of a focus on human need. In another article, Jones criticizes the prosperity theology interpretation of the Abrahamic covenant, God's promise to bless Abraham's descendants, arguing that this blessing is spiritual and should already apply to all Christians. He also argues that the proponents of the doctrine misconstrue the atonement, criticizing their teaching that Jesus' death took away poverty as well as sin. He believes that this teaching is drawn from a misunderstanding of Jesus' life and criticizes John Avanzini's teaching that Jesus was wealthy as a misrepresentation,[82] noting that Paul often taught Christians to give up their material possessions. Although he accepts giving as \\"praiseworthy\\",[82] he questions the motives of prosperity theology and criticizes the \\"Law of Compensation\\",[82] which teaches that when Christians give generously, God will give back more in return. Rather, Jones cites Jesus' teaching to \\"give, hoping for nothing in return\\".[82] Jones and Woodbridge also note that Jesus instructed followers to focus on spiritual rewards, citing his command in Matthew 6:19–20 \\"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth ... But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven\\" (KJV). Jones criticizes the doctrine's view of faith: he does not believe that it should be used as a spiritual force for material gain but seen as selfless acceptance of God.[82] In 1980, the General Council of the Assemblies of God criticized the doctrine of positive confession, noting examples of negative confessions in the Bible (where Biblical figures express fears and doubts) that had positive results and contrasting these examples with the focus on positive confessions taught by prosperity theology. The Council argues that the biblical Greek word often translated as \\"confess\\" literally translates as \\"to speak the same thing\\", and refers to both positive and negative confessions. The statement also criticizes the doctrine for failing to recognize the will of God: God's will should have precedence over the will of man, including their desires for wealth, and Christians should \\"recognize the sovereignty of God\\". The statement further criticizes prosperity theology for overlooking the importance of prayer, arguing that prayer should be used for all requests, not simply positive confession. The Council noted that Christians should expect suffering in this life. They urge readers to apply practical tests to positive confession, arguing that the doctrine appeals to those who are already in affluent societies but that many Christians in other societies are impoverished or imprisoned. Finally, the paper criticizes the distinction made by advocates of prosperity theology in the two Greek words that mean \\"speaking\\", arguing that the distinction is false and that they are used interchangeably in the Greek text.[F] The Council accused prosperity theology of taking passages out of context to fulfill its own needs, with the result that doctrine of positive confession is contradictory to the holistic message of the Bible. In April 2015, LDS apostle Dallin H. Oaks stated that people who believe in \\"the theology of prosperity\\" are deceived by riches. He continued by saying that the \\"possession of wealth or significant income is not a mark of heavenly favor, and their absence is not evidence of heavenly disfavor\\". He also cited how Jesus differentiated the attitudes towards money held by the young rich man in Mark 10:17–24, the good Samaritan, and Judas Iscariot in his betrayal. Oaks concluded this portion of his sermon by highlighting that the \\"root of all evil is not money but the love of money\\".[90] In 2015, well known pastor and prosperity gospel advocate Creflo Dollar launched a fundraising campaign to replace a previous private jet with a 65 million Gulfstream G650.[91] On the August 16, 2015 episode of his HBO weekly series Last Week Tonight, John Oliver satirized prosperity theology by announcing that he had established his own tax-exempt church, called Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption. In a lengthy segment, Oliver focused on what he characterized as the predatory conduct of televangelists who appeal for repeated gifts from people in financial distress or personal crises, and he criticized the very loose requirements for entities to obtain tax exempt status as churches under U.S. tax law. Oliver said that he would ultimately donate any money collected by the church to Doctors Without Borders.[92] In July 2018, Antonio Spadaro and Marcelo Figueroa, in the Jesuit journal La Civiltà Cattolica, examined the origins of the prosperity gospel in the United States and described it as a reductive version of the American Dream which had offered opportunities of success and prosperity unreachable in the Old World. The authors distinguished the prosperity gospel from Max Weber's Protestant ethic, noting that the protestant ethic related prosperity to religiously inspired austerity while the prosperity gospel saw prosperity as the simple result of personal faith. They criticized many aspects of the prosperity gospel, noting particularly the tendency of believers to lack compassion for the poor, since their poverty was seen as a sign that they had not followed the rules and therefore are not loved by God.[93][94] Notable works advocating prosperity theology [ edit ] Notable works that advocate prosperity theology include:[29] See also [ edit ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Pejorative nicknames have been attached to the theology, including \\"name it and claim it\\" and \\"blab it and grab it\\".[96] ^ The theme of Abundant life sometimes is used by leaders associated with the Word of Faith movement to refer to the experience of congregants who corporately experience the results of faith. ^ Bakker renounced prosperity theology after being imprisoned for fraud. ^ Osteen's teachings are often described as a moderate form of prosperity theology.[29] ^ After the probe was opened, Joyce Meyer Ministries voluntarily joined the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.[99] ^ The Council notes that the words Rhema and Logos are used interchangeably in the New Testament, and a Hebrew word is rendered into both words in different passages of the Septuagint. ^ Prosperity theology is often seen as supporting laissez-faire economics.

The preacher opened up about his need for a new jet on a weekly video message posted on the Jesse Duplantis Ministries website. “Now some people believe that preachers shouldn’t have jets. I really believe that preachers ought to go on every available voice, every available outlet, to get this gospel preached to the world,” he said. This wouldn’t be his first jet — it would be his fourth — but it would be his first jet with three engines that would allow him to go anywhere in the world without stopping, he said. “I really believe that if Jesus was physically on Earth today, he wouldn’t be riding a donkey,” Duplantis said. “Think about that for a minute. He’d be in an airplane preaching the gospel all over the world.” According to the St. Charles Herald, Duplantis’ home is a combined 35,000 square feet. That includes 22,039 square feet of living space 12,947 square feet of outdoor patios, garages and other amenities.

Her father was a successful investment banker and became an important financial official. Her family was very rich. Katharine grew up in large houses in New York and Washington. Her parents were often away from home, traveling and working, Katharine was often lonely. Katherine Meyer graduated from the University of Chicago in Illinois in 1938. In 1933, her father bought a failing newspaper, The Washington Post. It was the least successful one of five newspapers in Washington. Katharine Graham returned to Washington and got a job editing letters to the editor of her father's newspaper. She married Philip Graham. He was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter but soon accepted a job at his wife's father's newspaper. Mr. Graham improved The Washington Post. He bought Newsweek and several television stations. He also established close ties with important political leaders. However, Mr. Graham treated his wife badly. He had an affair with a young reporter. For many years, Mr. Graham suffered from mental illness. He killed himself in 1963. Katharine Graham had four children to raise and a newspaper to operate. At first, she was only concerned about finding a way to keep control of The Washington Post until her sons were old enough. She did not think she had the ability to do an important job.

Bert has four times as many stamps as Ernie, but Ernie has three times as many stamps as Peggy. If Peggy currently has 75 stamps in her collection, how many stamps does she need to add to her collection to have a collection as large as Bert's collection? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Given that Peggy has 75 stamps, and Ernie has three times as many stamps as Peggy, we can calculate the number of stamps Ernie has: Ernie's stamps = 3 * Peggy's stamps = 3 * 75 = 225 stamps. Now, Bert has four times as many stamps as Ernie, so we can calculate the number of stamps Bert has: Bert's stamps = 4 * Ernie's stamps = 4 * 225 = 900 stamps. Finally, to find out how many stamps Peggy needs to add to her collection to have as many as Bert's collection, we can subtract her current number of stamps from Bert's number of stamps: Stamps needed = Bert's stamps - Peggy's stamps = 900 - 75 = 825 stamps. Therefore, Peggy needs to add 825 stamps to her collection to have a collection as large as Bert's collection."},{"question":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

Answer:","response":"The connection between Gerry Rafferty and Sherlock Holmes may not be immediately obvious, but it can be found when we delve into their respective worlds: the world of music and the world of literature. Specifically, the link between these two seemingly disparate figures is associated with the iconic location of Baker Street. Gerry Rafferty (1947-2011) was a Scottish singer-songwriter best known for his hit songs \\"Baker Street\\" (1978) and \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\" (1972, recorded with his band Stealers Wheel). The former song, \\"Baker Street,\\" is an iconic piece that defines Rafferty's career, characterized by Raphael Ravenscroft's haunting saxophone riff. The song's lyrics reflect on themes of alienation, disillusionment, and the search for personal and creative freedom. Sherlock Holmes, on the other hand, is a fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930), a British writer and physician. Holmes first appeared in the novel \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" (1887) and subsequently starred in a series of novels and short stories. Known for his brilliant mind, logical reasoning, and meticulous observation skills, Holmes quickly became a classic and enduring character in detective fiction. The stories featuring Holmes and his friend and chronicler Dr. John Watson were set primarily in late 19th-century and early 20th-century London. The connection between Gerry Rafferty and Sherlock Holmes arises through the physical and metaphorical significance of Baker Street. In the world of Sherlock Holmes, 221B Baker Street is the fictional address of his residence and office. Dr. Watson and he shared the flat, which served as their base for solving various mysteries and criminal cases. Due to the immense popularity of Doyle's stories, Baker Street became synonymous with detective work and, in particular, with the character of Sherlock Holmes. In Rafferty's \\"Baker Street,\\" the London thoroughfare stands as a symbol of the singer's journey toward self-discovery and personal growth. The song's introspective and evocative lyrics describe a man who feels lost in the city, pondering life and yearning for change. In this context, Baker Street embodies the universal struggles of human existence – the constant search for meaning, identity, and connection in an often confusing and alienating world. The link between the two lies in Baker Street representing an essential part of their identity: For Sherlock Holmes, it is his home and workplace, a nucleus of his investigative career, while for Gerry Rafferty, it symbolizes the core of his self-exploration and artistic expression. In conclusion, the link between Gerry Rafferty and Sherlock Holmes is established through the common ground of Baker Street. Despite their distinct realms of existence – one a musician and the other a fictional detective – their shared connection to Baker Street serves as a powerful thread that ties them together. This connection transcends time and space, illustrating the lasting impact and relevance of both Rafferty's music and Doyle's iconic detective in popular culture."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky... Guess a valid title for it!

So, we have -38 * d (which means -38 times d) plus 42 * d (which means 42 times d) and it equals 16. Now, imagine you have -38 apples with d painted on each, and you also have 42 apples with d painted on each. Let's put all the apples together in one big basket. So we'd have (-38 + 42) apples with d painted on them. Since we're adding a smaller negative number to a bigger positive number, we know the result will be positive. Now let's count the apples: We have 42 and we take away 38, which leaves us with 4 apples. So, the equation turns into: 4 * d = 16. Now we want to find out how many times the number painted on the apple (d) fits into 16. If we divide the number 16 by the number of apples we have (which is 4), we'll find the answer: 16 divided by 4 is 4. So, the missing number (d) is 4!

Even a little shut eye can help you stay up for the rest of the night. One study found that people did better with just a 26-minute nap. So shut your eyes for just a little bit, and you should find it easier to make it through the entire night and next day. The key here is to take a short nap because otherwise you could end up in a deep sleep, which is very hard to wake out of. You could also sleep a little bit longer the night before you know you will be up all night. The body will “bank” the sleep, and it will be easier to get through the stretch of sleeplessness without it. Your body clock is actually aware of changes in light and darkness, and you will feel more awake in the light. The body clock is linked physically to the eyes. If you’re super tired the next day, go outside. The sunlight will also function to wake your body up more. The darkness causes the body to produce melatonin, which is the sleep hormone. People’s instinct is often to turn down the lights at night, but that’s probably going to make you more sleepy as the body perceives it’s time to call it a night. Turning the lights higher than normal will trick the body. The brain is going to be more alert after you move a bit. If you don’t have time to exercise, you could just engage in a conversation, wash the dishes – do something to focus your body on a new action for a time. Changing an activity also might wake the body up more. The body will become more alert to compensate for the new activity. The body feels less tired when you’re busy because it will focus on the task instead of the lack of sleep. Mental activities also may help you stay awake by keeping your focus on something other than the fact you're tired. So try playing a game. Some mental activities, like reading a book, may make you more sleepy, though, especially if you do them while lying down. You could listen to a talking radio show though. The body temperature naturally lowers during sleep, so people sleep better when it’s colder. However, a hot room is probably going to make you feel drowsy. Other ways to trick the body into feeling more wakeful include taking a cold shower and getting dressed up for your day. In addition to turning down the room temperature, you could also open a window. The breeze should help you stay awake, in addition to the lower temperature (if it's cool outside). Summary:","response":"Taking a short nap, even for just a few minutes, can improve performance and reduce signs of sleepiness, helping you stay awake longer. A 26-minute nap has been found to be effective in a study. It is essential to avoid long naps, as they can lead to deep sleep which is harder to awaken from. Banking sleep by sleeping longer the night before an all-nighter can also be helpful. The body clock is aware of changes in light and darkness, and adjusting lighting can help regulate wakefulness. Brighter lights can make you feel more awake, while darkness increases the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Engaging in physical or mental activities can also keep the body alert and focused, preventing feelings of sleepiness. Some activities may make you more tired, so choose actions that are stimulating and engage your mind. Finally, controlling the room temperature can help you stay awake. A colder room is better for sleep, but a hot room can make you feel drowsy. To feel more wakeful, try lowering the room temperature, opening a window, taking a cold shower, or dressing up for the day. These strategies work by tricking the body into feeling more alert and awake."},{"question":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Green Man, food = French, priceRange = moderate, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no, near = All Bar One Sentence:","response":"The Green Man, an exclusively adult-oriented French restaurant offering a moderately-priced menu, is nestled in the bustling city centre just mere steps away from the lively atmosphere of All Bar One, making it a perfect gastronomic experience for sophisticated food enthusiasts."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text. Bob wanted to add insulation to the wall of his house, but the","response":"wall was already constructed with bricks, and there was no space to easily insert insulation material. He had been living in the house for several years now and had always felt the chill during winters even when the heating was on, causing discomfort and increase in electricity bills. He was also aware that inefficient insulation could lead to unnecessary energy waste, which is not good for the environment. To add insulation to the existing wall, Bob did exhaustive research and found out a few methods he could use to insulate the walls from the outside or inside, without tearing down the entire structure. Some of the methods he discovered were cavity wall insulation, external wall insulation, and internal wall insulation. Cavity wall insulation involves filling the void or cavity between the exterior brick wall and the inner wall with insulation material such as mineral wool, polystyrene beads, or polyurethane foam. Bob realized that since his walls were already built using solid bricks, the cavity wall insulation method would not be a suitable choice for him. Next, Bob considered external wall insulation. In this method, insulation material like rigid insulation boards or mineral wool is added to the exterior side of the wall, which is then covered with a render or cladding to maintain the appearance of the house. Bob found some benefits of external wall insulation, such as reduced heat loss, soundproofing, and protection of the existing brickwork. However, the cost and effort of installing external wall insulation seemed significantly higher, and he would need to acquire a permit from the local authorities. Finally, Bob looked into the option of internal wall insulation. This method involves adding insulation to the inner side of the walls, generally using insulation boards or a stud wall constructed from timber battens and filled with insulation material. Though internal wall insulation can be less expensive, it requires substantial work, as it involves moving or fixing electrical wires, pipework, and other fixtures on the wall. After weighing the pros and cons of each method, Bob decided to go for internal wall insulation, as it seemed more feasible and cost-effective for his situation. Before starting the installation, he consulted a professional insulation installer to conduct a thorough assessment of his house and provide expert advice on the best insulation materials and thickness required. The installer suggested using thermal insulation boards, as they offer an excellent insulation value and take up less space compared to other materials. Bob also decided to invest in some high-quality sealants to seal any existing gaps or cracks in the walls to reduce drafts and improve energy efficiency further. Once the materials were purchased, Bob carefully planned the installation process—starting with moving and protecting the furniture, removing any fixtures on the walls, and labeling all the electrical wires. He built a stud wall made of timber battens, carefully filled them with insulation material, and covered them with a layer of plasterboard. After securing the plasterboard, he finished the wall surface with a plaster skim for a smooth appearance. Bob spent several weekends completing the insulation project, making sure each room was well insulated. Although it was a challenging and time-consuming project, the end result was a significantly warmer and more comfortable home. Bob noticed a considerable reduction in electricity bills and felt satisfied that he had not only made a positive change for his family but also contributed to a more sustainable environment. Overall, adding insulation to the walls of his house was a wise investment for Bob, proving to be both energy-efficient and cost-effective. Anybody facing a similar situation can explore suitable insulation methods, depending on their house structure and budget, to substantially improve their home's thermal performance and reduce their carbon footprint."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_).

These morons claim it's all about promoting health, but they're too dumb to see e-cigs are doing exactly that. I haven't had a real smoke in months thanks to e-cigs. Ban them and people will smoke the real thing. Maybe that's the point. Henry Waxman wants me dead. Of course, their cowardly and profoundly infantile defense will always be about perceived danger -- that way you don't have to come up with facts. Hence our new villain is secondhand water vapor.

Some people, including politicians, want to ban e-cigarettes at the Capitol. 2. They believe e-cigarettes are as harmful as regular cigarettes, but they don't have research to back up their claims. 3. E-cigarettes help some people quit smoking regular cigarettes, which can be good for their health. 4.

Here, we will use knowledge of physical objects in terms of their size, weight, and function to efficiently organize the space. Step 1: Identify Physical Objects Think of the different categories of objects in the room, such as clothes, books, electronics, and furniture. Identifying the various classes of physical objects helps to plan their respective places for organization. Step 2: Assess the Available Space Examine the storage spaces in the room, such as closets, shelves, drawers, or cabinets, and determine their capacity to hold various items. Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Items Eliminate anything that is not necessary or does not belong in the room to make the organizing process more manageable. Step 4: Sort Items by Function Separate items according to their function or purpose, so it's easier to decide where they should be stored or placed. For example, clothes should be placed in the closet or drawer, books should be put on a bookshelf, and electronic devices should be near power outlets. Step 5: Organize Heavy and Large Items First Arrange the heavier objects, such as furniture and large electronic devices, in the room first, ensuring they are appropriately placed and functional. This step is important as it sets the foundation and frees up more space for organizing the smaller items. Step 6: Store Similar Items Together Group items by their purpose or function. Storing similar items together makes it easier to find and access them when needed and creates a visually pleasing environment. Step 7: Maintain Accessibility Place frequently used items in easily accessible locations, while less frequently used items can be stored in more remote spots. Step 8: Evaluate and Adjust After organizing the room, take a final look to ensure everything is in its proper place and is functional. Adjust if needed to improve accessibility or aesthetics. By applying knowledge of physical objects during this organization process, the task can be completed more efficiently and create a well-organized, accessible, and functional space."},{"question":"De Muhamet Brajshori, din Pristina pentru Southeast European Times -- 15/07/11 Which language is this?","response":"This text is written in the Romanian language.

At its peak, the Rashtrakutas ruled from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions.[citation needed] The early kings of this dynasty were Hindu but the later kings were strongly influenced by Jainism. Govinda III and Amoghavarsha were the most famous of the long line of able administrators produced by the dynasty. Amoghavarsha, who ruled for 64 years, was also an author and wrote Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada work on poetics. Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora. Other important contributions are the sculptures of Elephanta Caves in modern Maharashtra as well as the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in modern Karnataka, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Arab traveler Suleiman described the Rashtrakuta Empire as one of the four great Empires of the world.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. I am facing a new situation today: A team of archaeologists studied two human settlements, village Alpha from about 11000 years ago and village Beta, which existed 9000 years ago. Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture.

By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.Canada entered the Second World War in 1939.

True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early \\"stem-birds\\", such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Scientists have used a combination of methodologies and evidence to learn more about the timeline for birds' evolution. This includes the examination of fossils, analysis of DNA, and the study of geologic events. Here's a summary of the key aspects: 1. Fossil Evidence: Fossils have provided crucial information about the morphology and anatomy of extinct bird species and their ancestors. Archaeopteryx, for instance, is an early stem-bird dating back to the mid-Jurassic period with features of both dinosaurs and birds. Researchers have discovered various fossils of feathered theropod dinosaurs that lie outside the class Aves, but are part of the broader group Avialae, indicating the gradual evolution of birds from their dinosaurian ancestors. 2. DNA-based Evidence: By analyzing the DNA of living birds and their closest living relatives, scientists have gained insights into the diversification and evolutionary relationships among bird species. Molecular clock dating techniques, which make use of DNA sequence differences to estimate the age of divergence between species, have suggested that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs. 3. Geologic Events: Studies of geologic events, such as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and global cooling periods, provide essential context for understanding bird evolution. These events have shaped the distribution of bird species and the ways they have adapted to their environments over time. For example, bird species in South America survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and subsequently colonized other parts of the world via land bridges, diversifying in response to changing climatic conditions. 4. Comparative Anatomy and Paleobiology: Comparing the skeletal structures and morphological traits of extinct bird-like dinosaurs and living birds helps scientists understand the functional adaptations and constraints that have shaped avian evolution. For example, early stem-birds shared many features with their theropod dinosaur ancestors, such as toothy jaws and long bony tails, but they also displayed adaptations for powered flight, including the presence of feathers, a wishbone, and other skeletal modifications. In summary, scientists have used a multidisciplinary approach, combining fossil evidence, DNA analysis, the study of geologic events, and comparative anatomy to learn more about the timeline for birds' evolution, uncovering their origins from feathered dinosaur ancestors, their diversification following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, and their adaptations to changing environments over millions of years."},{"question":"miroslav Šmudla associate czech republic and slovakia +420 226 030 500 email This is all lower case.

Firstly, the author expresses feeling overwhelmed with their to-do list, indicating that they have too much to accomplish - this suggests the sentiment is negative in nature. This sense of being overwhelmed is emphasized with the statement \\"So much to accomplish - and clean - before we leave for the beach.\\" The urgency to complete all necessary tasks before leaving adds a stress component to the sentiment. However, there is also a slight humorous aspect in the tweet, which can somewhat neutralize the negativity. The author mentions that their pedicure (pedi) may not make the cut, suggesting that their priorities are overwhelming to the point that they may have to let go of some personal indulgences or less important tasks in order to prepare for the trip. This light-hearted reference to the pedicure provides a more positive or playful tone to the tweet, countering the negativity. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is predominantly negative and overwhelmed due to the stress experienced by the author relating to their extensive to-do list before going to the beach. However, the mention of their pedicure not making the cut adds a subtle humorous and playful tone, showing that the author still manages to find some lightheartedness in their situation."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\"\\".

He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. Along with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group would ascend to world-wide fame during the 1960s. Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939-2015) in 1957 when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically--any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\" Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later. Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on the grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her PS100,000 (240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did they stay together?","response":"No, John Lennon and Cynthia Powell did not stay together.

As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed.

Though it sometimes means any widely played or big-selling song, the term \\"hit\\" usually refers to a single that has appeared in an official music chart through repeated radio airplay or significant commercial sales. - Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s,\\" the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, pop and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. - A signature song is the one song (or, in some cases, one of a few songs) that a popular and well-established recording artist or band is most closely identified with or best known for, even if they have had success with a variety of other songs. There have also been instances where a film actor has acquired a signature song by giving a popular vocal performance in a feature. Signature songs can be the result of spontaneous public identification, or a marketing tool developed by the music industry to promote artists, sell their recordings, and develop a fan base. - Sterno (\\"canned heat\\") is a fuel made from denatured and jellied alcohol. It is designed to be burned directly from its can. Its primary uses are in the food service industry for buffet heating and in the home for fondue and as a chafing fuel for heating chafing dishes. Other uses are for camp stoves and as an emergency heat source. It is also a popular fuel for use with toy and model steam and other external combustion engines. Sterno cans were sometimes taken on trips and used to heat pressing and curling irons and hot combs, for hairstyling, when travelers were staying at hotels and not located near salons which offered certain services that required these styling tools. - \\"Take Me to the River\\" is a 1974 song written by singer Al Green and guitarist Mabon \\"Teenie\\" Hodges. Hit versions were recorded by both Syl Johnson and Talking Heads. In 2004, Al Green's original version was ranked number 117 on \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - The Woodstock Music & Art Fairinformally, the Woodstock Festival or simply Woodstockwas a music festival attracting an audience of over 400,000 people, scheduled over three days on a dairy farm in New York state from August 15 to 17, 1969, but ultimately ran four days long, ending August 18, 1969. - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico.

With a booming voice and looming physical presence, he is one of the best-known Chicago blues artists. Musician and critic Cub Koda noted, \\"no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits.\\" Producer Sam Phillips recalled, \\"When I heard Howlin' Wolf, I said, 'This is for me. This is where the soul of man never dies'\\". Several of his songs, including \\"Smokestack Lightnin'\\", \\"Back Door Man\\", \\"Killing Floor\\" and \\"Spoonful\\", have become blues and blues rock standards. In 2004, \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine ranked him number 51 on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\". - World music is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the globe, which includes many genres including some forms of Western music represented by folk music, as well as selected forms of ethnic music, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition, such as when ethnic music and Western popular music intermingle. - The Ventures are an American instrumental rock band formed in 1958 in Tacoma, Washington. Founded by Don Wilson and Bob Bogle, the group in its various incarnations has had an enduring impact on the development of music worldwide. With over 100 million records sold, the group is the best-selling instrumental band of all time.

Chicago blues is a type of urban blues. Urban blues evolved from classic blues following the Great Migration, or the Great Northern Drive, which was both forced and voluntary at times, of African-Americans from the southern United States to the industrial cities of the north, such as Chicago. Muddy Waters directly joined that migration, like many others, such as in Florida, avoiding the more harshly southern Jim Crow laws. Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records stated that, \\"Chicago blues is the music of the industrial city, and has an industrial sense about it.\\" Additionally, recognizing the shift in blues, Chicago Blues singer and guitarist, Kevin Moore expressed the blues transition stating, \\"You have to put some new life into it, new blood, new perspectives. You can't keep talking about mules, workin' on the levee.\\" Chicago blues was heavily influenced by Mississippi bluesman who traveled to Chicago in the early 1940s. The development of blues, up to Chicago blues, is arguably as follows: Country blues, to city blues, to urban blues\\". Chicago blues is based around the sound of the electric guitar and the harmonica, with the harmonica played through a PA system or guitar amplifier. - Michael \\"Cub\\" Koda (October 1, 1948 July 1, 2000) was an American rock and roll singer, guitarist, songwriter, disc jockey, music critic, and record compiler. \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine considered him best known for writing the song \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\", recorded by Brownsville Station, which reached number 3 on the 1974 Billboard chart.

The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration.

But he said there were no guarantees the UK government would protect EU funding, needed for the scheme. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies accused Mr Jones of using Brexit as a \\"smokescreen\\". Later Economy Secretary Ken Skates told AMs that construction on the metro will take place from 2019. The Metro is intended to provide better trains, faster buses and light rail or tram services in Cardiff and the valleys. It was announced last year that £600m will be spent on the current phase of the metro. That included £125m from the UK government and £150m in European regional development funding. In a statement on his priorities for government, the first minister told AMs on Tuesday that despite uncertainty over significant element of EU funding for the Metro project, his government \\"will be pressing ahead\\" with its development. \\"It may not be in exactly the same form as before, we will have to look at alternative funding models and it may take longer to get to where we want to be, but I believe this is an important signal to employers that Wales is still open for business\\", he said. Mr Jones said he had hoped to publish a detailed programme for the government's five-year term before the summer recess started next week, but he was putting it off until September because of Brexit. The first minister restated his call for the UK government to guarantee replacing the EU funding currently enjoyed by Wales, estimated at around £600m a year. \\"Without this assurance we face a very large hole in our future budgets,\\" he said. But Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \\"Instead of prevaricating, and using the Brexit vote as an excuse for a lack of ideas, the First Minister should get on with laying down his Programme for Government. \\"The reality, therefore, is that the First Minister is in danger of appearing as though he is using the EU referendum as a smokescreen to conceal the fact that his government has little to say on the real issues faced by Welsh communities everyday; such as the Welsh NHS, declining education standards, and the need to kick start the Welsh economy.\\" He added that Mr Jones's statement failed to mention the steel crisis among the government's priorities. Later in the Senedd Economy Secretary Mr Skates said construction on the Metro \\"will take place from 2019, with services operating as soon as possible, and this will depend on the solution being delivered\\".

Article: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\" quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.

The largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean, alone covers more area than all of Earth's landmasses combined. These oceans are crucial to our planet's climate, weather patterns, and habitability. The Earth's planetary boundary layer is the lowermost region of the troposphere, extending from the planet's surface upward. It is significant because it is where friction between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface primarily takes place. In this layer, interactions occur between the ocean, land surfaces, the atmosphere, and the biosphere, which influence weather and climate processes essential to life on Earth. The troposphere extends from Earth's surface up to an altitude varying between 6 to 20 kilometers (4 to 12 miles), depending on the latitude and season. It is the lowest level of Earth's atmosphere and contains around 80% of the atmosphere's total mass. Almost all weather phenomena and the life-sustaining processes of the water cycle occur within the troposphere. In summary, the answer you found on Google is not a correct answer to the question of how much of Earth is covered by ocean water. Instead, the accurate answer is that approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean water, essential for the planet's climate, weather patterns, and habitability."},{"question":"How to remove ink stains from polyester<br>Blot the ink away.

I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot. Starting out, we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie. One a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married. A police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about. The third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's. They are almost the \\"First Wives Club\\", and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex's involved as well as some \\"he left the credit card\\" behaviour. Characters set - the movie continues.

He buys an air compressor so he can air clean all of the dust from his computer. The compressor forces high powered streams of air by compressing the air inside it then releasing it through a tube. But I can use this background: Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way. As one variable increases in value, the other variable decreases. What is an answer for this question: Given the temperature stays constant, will the volume of the air inside the compressor increase or decrease? The answer is:","response":"Given the temperature stays constant, the volume of the air inside the compressor will decrease. According to Boyle's Law, there is an inverse relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas when the temperature is held constant. As the air compressor functions by compressing the air inside it, the pressure of the air increases. As a result, the volume of the air inside the compressor will decrease due to the inverse relationship between the pressure and volume. So, when Aaron uses the air compressor to clean his computer, the air pressure inside the compressor goes up, and the volume of the air goes down."},{"question":"Answer the following question: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

Firstly, it tells us that there is a man, and he is performing the action of kneeling. Secondly, it specifies where the man is kneeling: on top of a platform. Lastly, it mentions that four men are looking up at him, which can lead to the inference that the platform might be elevated, but this is not explicitly stated. Now, let's break down the statement \\"a man is on a platform\\" to better understand why it logically follows from the given statement. This statement is simply asserting that there is a man, and he is located on a platform. We can compare this with the original statement: 1. Both statements refer to a man. 2. Both statements describe the man as being on a platform. Hence, these similarities between the two statements confirm that it logically follows that \\"a man is on a platform\\" based on the given statement. Furthermore, the given statement doesn't contradict or negate the statement \\"a man is on a platform\\" in any way. The fact that the man is kneeling on the platform, as well as the presence of four additional men looking up at him, does not change the fundamental truth that a man is indeed on a platform. In conclusion, based on the given statement, \\"A man kneels on top of a platform as four men look up at him,\\" it is logical to deduce that \\"a man is on a platform\\" because the presence of a man on a platform is explicitly mentioned in the original statement, and the additional information provided does not conflict with this conclusion."},{"question":"Translate \\"All paragraphs should be of similar length, so that they are not too long for reading but contain all relevant information.\\" to Russian?","response":"To translate the given sentence from English to Russian, I will follow these steps: 1.

Bob Dylan released his album Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \\"Life Is Hard,\\" \\"the record sort of took its own direction\\". Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.The album received largely favorable reviews, although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work.

They are our most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one pen and one book can change the world. Education is the only solution,\\" said Yousafzai, speaking out for the first time since she was attacked. Wearing a pink head scarf, Yousafzai told U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and nearly 1,000 students attending an international Youth Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York that education was the only way to improve lives. Yousafzai was shot at close range by gunmen in October as she left school in Pakistan's Swat Valley, northwest of the country's capital Islamabad. She was targeted for her campaign against the Islamist Taliban efforts to deny women education. \\"They shot my friends too. They thought that the bullets would silence us. But they failed and out of that silence came thousands of voices,\\" she said to cheers from the students gathered at U.N. hall. \\"The terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions, but nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born,\\" a confident Yousafzai said. She wore a white shawl draped around her shoulders that had belonged to former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated during a 2007 election rally weeks after she returned to Pakistan from years in self-imposed exile. \\"I am not against anyone, neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. I'm here to speak up for the right of education for every child,\\" she said. \\"I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all terrorists and extremists,\\" she said. \\"I do not even hate the talib who shot me. Even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me, I would not shoot him.\\" Yousafzai presented Ban with a petition signed by some 4 million people in support of 57 million children around the world who are not able to go to school. It demanded that world leaders fund new teachers, schools and books and end child labor, marriage and trafficking. Ban said that the United Nations was committed to a target of getting all children in school by the end of 2015. \\"No child should have to die for going to school. Nowhere should teachers fear to teach or children fear to learn. Together, we can change this picture,\\" he said. \\"Together, let us follow the lead of this brave young girl, Malala.\\" TIRED OF WAR U.N. Special Envoy for Global Education, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said Friday's event was not just a celebration of Malala's birthday and of her recovery, but of her vision. He invoked \\"her dream that nothing, no political indifference, no government inaction, no intimidation, no threats, no assassin's bullets should ever deny the right of every single child ... to be able to go to school.\\" Brown described Yousafzai's recovery from the attack as a miracle. The teenager was treated in Pakistan before the United Arab Emirates provided an air ambulance to fly her to Britain, where doctors mended parts of her skull with a titanium plate. Unable to safely return to Pakistan, Yousafzai enrolled in a school in Birmingham, England in March. Her mother wiped away tears on Friday as she watched her daughter thank all those who helped save her life. Pakistan has 5 million children out of school, a number only surpassed by Nigeria, which has more than 10 million children out of school, according to the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt on Yousafzai, calling her efforts pro-Western. Two of her classmates were also wounded. The Pakistan Taliban, formally called the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), formed in 2007, is an umbrella group uniting various militant factions operating in the volatile northwestern tribal areas along the porous border with Afghanistan. Under Taliban rule in neighboring Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, women were forced to cover up and were banned from voting, most work and leaving their homes unless accompanied by a husband or male relative. \\"The extremists were and they are afraid of books and pens, the power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women,\\" Yousafzai said. \\"When we were in Swat ... we realized the importance of pens and books when we saw the guns.\\" (Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Vicki Allen and David Storey) ||||| Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl shot by the Taliban for advocating education for girls, marked her 16th birthday with an impressive speech at the United Nations, where she said education could change the world.

Strength, power and courage was born.\\" The UN has declared her birthday, July 12, as \\"Malala Day\\". The Pakistani teenager, who first came to public attention at the age of 11 for speaking out against a ban on girls' education, was shot in the neck and head by Taliban gunmen last October on her way home from school in Pakistan. She left a Birmingham hospital in February after she recovered from surgery during which doctors mended parts of her skull with a titanium plate and inserted a cochlear implant in her left ear to help restore hearing. Malala used her speech at the UN to ask the UN secretary-general and any listening world leaders on the need to keep a promise to provide universal primary education by the end of 2015. She also handed over a petition to Ban signed by about four million people calling on the 193 UN members to finance teachers, schools and books to meet the education. \\"From the day that terrible shooting - assassination attempt - took place, Malala Yousafzai is a symbol for the rights of girls, and indeed the rights of all young people, to an education,\\" said UN spokesman Martin Nesirky. Taliban threats UN Special Envoy for Global Education, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said Friday's event was not just a celebration of Malala's birthday and her recovery, but of her vision. \\"Her dream that nothing, no political indifference, no government inaction, no intimidation, no threats, no assassin's bullets should ever deny the right of every single child ... to be able to go to school,\\" said Brown.

Strength, power and courage was born Malala Yousafzai Now, more girls are attending schools in the Swat Valley. But the UN estimates that 57 million children of primary school age do not get an education - half of them in countries at conflict, such as Syria. Pakistan has 5 million children out of school, a number only surpassed by Nigeria, which has more than 10 million children out of school, according to UN cultural agency UNESCO. Most of those are girls. James Bays, Al Jazeera's Diplomatic Editor, reporting from the United Nations, said that campaigners for global education are hoping that this speech will make a change in trying to encourage countries around the world, to support the plan to try and get all children in school by 2015. According to Ban's annual report on children and conflict, 115 schools were attacked last year in Mali, 321 in the occupied Palestinian territories, 167 in Afghanistan, and 165 in Yemen. Malala and her family briefly left Swat during a government offensive on the Taliban-controlled territory. On their return, they were threatened by armed groups before the attack on October 9 last year. The family now lives in Birmingham, where Malala has undergone surgery and rehabilitation. In March, Malala joined pupils at Edgbaston High School for Girls in the neighbourhood. She is one of the favourites to become the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate this year. She has already been named as one of Time magazine's most influential people in 2013 and has reportedly secured a 3m contract for a book on her life story. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban for advocating education for girls, celebrated her 16th birthday with a passionate speech at the United Nations.

What are the on-page SEO and off-page SEO checklists for a website? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"The two questions are not paraphrases of each other; they address different aspects of search engine optimization (SEO). The first question focuses on the importance of obtaining backlinks from high PageRank (PR) sites or specific high PR pages, while the second question asks for on-page and off-page SEO checklists for a website. Let's address each question in detail. 1. Do you need to build backlinks from a high PR site or high PR page? Backlinks, also known as inbound or incoming links, are crucial for SEO, as they are considered as votes for a website's credibility and authority by search engines. High-quality backlinks can significantly improve a website's search engine rankings. In the past, PageRank was a primary factor that search engines like Google used to determine a webpage's importance. A high PR site or page indicated a more authoritative and relevant source. However, Google no longer reports public PR scores, and modern SEO practices focus more on the overall quality and relevance of the links and the websites providing those links. Instead of focusing solely on PR, it is essential to consider other factors like domain authority, relevance, and trustworthiness. A few high-quality and relevant backlinks from authoritative sites are more valuable than numerous low-quality or irrelevant links from less reputable sources. So, strategically building backlinks from relevant and authoritative sites or pages is crucial for your website's SEO success. 2. What are the on-page SEO and off-page SEO checklists for a website? On-page SEO and off-page SEO are two critical aspects of optimizing a website for search engines, and they have different requirements and checklists. Here is a breakdown of both on-page and off-page SEO checklists: On-page SEO Checklist: a.

Keyword Research and Optimization: - Identify relevant and valuable keywords for your content - Implement primary and secondary keywords strategically throughout the content while avoiding keyword stuffing - Utilize long-tail keywords for better targeting and conversion c. Meta Tags: - Write unique and compelling title tags and meta descriptions for each webpage - Include targeted keywords in title tags and meta descriptions while maintaining readability - Keep title tags within 50-60 characters and meta descriptions within 150-160 characters d. Header Tags: - Use header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to break down and structure content for readability - Include relevant keywords in header tags, particularly in H1 and H2 e. URL Structure: - Use SEO-friendly URLs that are concise and descriptive - Incorporate the primary keyword for the page in the URL f. Internal Linking: - Provide relevant internal links throughout the content to improve user navigation and site structure - Use keyword-optimized and descriptive anchor text for internal links g. Image Optimization: - Utilize descriptive and keyword-rich filenames and alt text for images - Compress images to reduce loading time without sacrificing quality h.

Overenthusiastic in building a “world-class” industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries, namely, electronics, cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless. The mistakes the government made during this period resulted in what type of growth?","response":"The mistakes the government made during this period resulted in negative economic growth. This negative growth was primarily due to several factors and missteps by the government in their pursuit of rapidly industrializing the nation. To provide a bit of context, the 1950s marked the period after the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established by the Communist Party of China (CPC). The government was ambitious about transforming the country into a heavy industry production hub, specifically for East China. As a result, they placed a great deal of investment into building state-owned heavy industries that fell under a national plan to expedite industrialization. Despite their well-intentioned goals, the government made several disastrous mistakes in the development process. One significant error was their decision to spend hundreds of millions of yuan in an futile attempt to mine for non-existent coal. Not only was this a financially wasteful endeavor, but it was also detrimental to the economy, which actually contracted during the late 1960s stage, leading to the negative economic growth mentioned in the article. From the 1960s to 1980s, the government identified and fostered five pillar industries: electronics, cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each backed by big state-owned enterprises. However, following the Reform and Opening policy which aimed to transition China's economy towards a more market-oriented model, these state-owned enterprises struggled to compete against efficient multinational firms and dynamic local private firms. They found themselves ensnared in heavy debt, leading some to go bankrupt or be forced into privatization. These factors contributed significantly to the negative economic growth experienced during this period. Additionally, this disruption in the industrial ecosystem led to massive layoffs, leaving many workers technically not unemployed, but to a large scale, effectively jobless. This further exacerbated the economic challenges, as job loss has a significant correlation with economic performance. Lower employment leads to a decrease in consumer spending, which in turn, depresses economic growth. Thus, the government's mistakes during this period of rapid industrialization and transition to a market economy culminated in a situation of negative economic growth."},{"question":"Size of the room 168 m Add punctuation.","response":"The size of the room is 168 meters."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills.

Options: A. eternal B. religious C. unpredictable D. holy E. monastic Answer:","response":"James thought that giving the AI a secular upbringing would be the better choice. He felt that the alternative might have results that were too unpredictable. The reason for choosing option C, \\"unpredictable,\\" is based on the understanding of a secular upbringing, which generally means that an AI would be brought up to function without any religious biases or influences. In the context of the question, it seems that James is concerned about the potential consequences of an upbringing that incorporates religious elements. Option B, \\"religious,\\" might seem like an obvious choice because of the direct contrast between secular and religious upbringings. However, James' concern isn't about whether the AI would become religious, but rather the potential unpredictability of the outcomes in the alternative scenario. Raising an AI with religious influences might result in an AI that is biased towards or against certain religious groups or beliefs, which in turn could lead to unexpected and potentially negative consequences. Option A, \\"eternal,\\" is unrelated to the context in question, as it suggests a permanent state or ongoing existence. The word does not convey the unpredictable nature of concern James might have with the alternative upbringing. Option D, \\"holy,\\" is also not the most appropriate choice, as it implies that the AI would be considered sacred or religious in some way if given an alternative upbringing. Though this might be an outcome, the emphasis of James' concern is on the unpredictability of the results rather than the AI becoming holy itself. Option E, \\"monastic,\\" refers to a lifestyle practiced by monks or nuns and is unrelated to James' concerns about the potential unpredictability of the alternative upbringing for an AI. In conclusion, in the context of the question, the most fitting option in line with common sense is C, \\"unpredictable,\\" because James is worried about the unforeseen consequences which might arise from the alternative upbringing, which might involve religious influences on the AI's development. By choosing a secular upbringing, James believes that the AI would function more predictably and without potential biases that could come with religious influences."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Quakers are a smaller breed of parrot, but because of their active nature, they do best with a roomy cage. An 18” x 18” x 18” cage should probably be the minimum size for your bird, but also consider safety and security features. Quaker parrots are known for being escape artists, so make sure the bars on the cage are not too far apart, nor at the same time narrow enough that a curious quaker can get its head stuck between them. ⅝-inch spacing between bars is a good reference point. Likewise, to counteract their curiosity and escapability, choose a gate that swings open (not a guillotine-style gate that a quaker may be able to lift up only to have it become a trap). Quakers have been known to figure out how to unlatch a gate, so consider a lock as well. A repetitive daily diet of bird food pellets not only lacks the diversity to provide proper nutrition, it may also cause boredom (and thus a lack of eating) in birds like quakers. Make the pellets part of the diet, but also mix in a variety of fruits and vegetables, and occasional seeds and nuts. Avoid feeding birds avocados, however, as this can be toxic to them; also skip chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol. Birds are messy — there is no way around it. In addition to droppings, quakers will strew food scraps, destroyed toys, and bits of anything else they can get their beaks on throughout the cage and on your floor. Give the cage a quick cleanup daily, removing large bits of junk and replacing the newspaper liner (you may want to subscribe to a daily paper if you’re going to be a bird owner). Each week, give the cage a more thorough cleaning, scrubbing down the bars and such. You may want to place the cage over an easier-to-clean floor surface, such as tile or hardwood rather than carpet. Take your quaker for annual checks (and more as warranted) by a veterinarian, preferably one with a bird specialization. Beak, claw, and feather health should be areas of particular focus for you and your vet, as problems in these areas are often indicators of larger issues. Quakers may be more susceptible to fatty liver disease, so don't let your bird become overweight. Limiting seeds and other high-fat foods may be necessary. Talk to your vet if you are concerned. Feather plucking is another disorder that can be common among quakers, and can have physical or behavioral causes. A good avian vet can help you with this issue as well.","response":"Quaker parrots are a small but active breed that requires a roomy cage, ideally 18\\" x 18\\" x 18\\", with safe and secure features such as ⅝-inch bar spacing and a lock due to their ability to escape.

As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. Starfleet Command sends out a planetary distress call and warns starships not to approach Earth. On the planet Vulcan, the former officers of the USS Enterprise are living in exile (after the events of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock). Accompanied by the Vulcan Spock, still recovering from his resurrection, the crewâexcept for Saavik, who remains on Vulcanâtake their captured Klingon Bird-of-Prey starship (nicknamed the Bounty, after the Royal Navy ship) and head to Earth to face trial for their theft and destruction of Enterprise. Hearing Starfleet's warning, Spock determines that the probe's signal matches the song of extinct humpback whales, and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered. The crew uses their ship to travel back in time via a slingshot maneuver around the Sun, planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal. Arriving in 1986, the crew finds their ship's power drained. Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its cloaking device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T.

Ernő Lendvai (February 6, 1925 – January 31, 1993) was one of the first music theorists to write on the appearance of the golden section and Fibonacci series and how these are implemented in Bartók's music, he also formulated the axis system, acoustic scale and alpha chord, an octatonic scale is any which number note musical scale? A:","response":"Ernő Lendvai, born on February 6, 1925, and passing away on January 31, 1993, was a reputable Hungarian music theorist. He was a pioneer in analyzing the relationship between mathematics and music, specifically in relation to the golden section, Fibonacci series, and their presence in Béla Bartók's compositions. The golden section, also known as the golden ratio or divine proportion, is a mathematical proportion with a value of approximately 1.618. It has been found in numerous aspects of nature, art, and architecture. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones (e.g., 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.). These mathematical concepts have a strong relationship with one another, and Lendvai illuminated their connections to music, especially in Bartók's works. Lendvai's Axis system is a theoretical model that highlights the symmetrical operations in music compositions, such as inversion and retrograde, and underscores how Bartók employed these techniques in his music. The acoustic scale, also known as the overtone scale, is a seven-note musical scale that emphasizes the natural harmonic series found in acoustics. The alpha chord, which is a distinctive feature in Bartók's harmonic language, is a special type of chord that can be constructed using the tones of an octatonic scale. An octatonic scale, the topic in question, is a symmetric eight-note musical scale that consists of alternating whole and half steps (or vice versa). It can be thought of as two interlocking diminished seventh chords. The term \\"octatonic\\" signifies that it has eight tones, derived from the Greek root \\"octa,\\" meaning eight. This scale has been utilized by various composers, such as Stravinsky, Messiaen, and of course, Bartók, to develop unique harmonic and melodic ideas. The symmetrical nature of the octatonic scale lends itself well to the exploration of various musical techniques, which was a significant aspect of Lendvai's work in connecting these mathematical concepts to Bartók's compositions."},{"question":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: A.C.

The offence must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a field goal (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What does a team do when they have not advance the ball enough to score or likely gain a new set of downs?","response":"When a team has not advanced the ball enough to score or likely gain a new set of downs within two downs, they usually have two options on their third down, depending on their position on the field: 1. Punting the ball: The team would typically choose to punt the ball on the third down. Punting involves the punter (a specialized player) kicking the ball downfield without letting it touch the ground. This action aims to place the opposing team in a less advantageous field position, making it more difficult for them to advance the ball and score on their possession. Punting is a strategic choice, as it forces the other team to cover a greater distance to reach the goal line. 2. Attempting a field goal: If the team is within field goal range (generally considered to be within 40 to 50 yards of the goal posts), they may opt to attempt a field goal on the third down. A field goal is a scoring play in which the placekicker (another specialized player) kicks the ball through the uprights of the goalposts. If successful, the team is awarded three points, after which they must kick off to the opposing team. The decision to punt or attempt a field goal depends on factors such as the team's field position, the kicker's range and accuracy, weather conditions, and game strategy. Ultimately, the team's goal when facing an unsuccessful series of downs is to minimize the advantage given to the opposition when possession changes hands."},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the reactants concentration would decrease, case A or case B? Answer:","response":"In order to determine which case would result in a decrease in reactant concentration, we first need to understand what is happening in each case. Case E: Equilibrium At equilibrium, the rate of forward reaction equals the rate of reverse reaction. The concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant over time. In this case, the reactant concentration is constant and does not decrease or increase. Case T: Temperature change Changing the temperature of a system at equilibrium can cause a shift in the equilibrium position, either favoring the forward reaction or the reverse reaction. The specific effect of temperature change on reactant and product concentrations depends on whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. Case A: Forward reaction favored In case A, the forward reaction is favored, meaning that there is a higher rate of reactants converting into products compared to the reverse reaction. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentration of reactants will decrease over time, as more reactants are being consumed to form products. Case B: Reverse reaction favored In case B, the reverse reaction is favored, which implies that the rate of products converting back into reactants is higher than the conversion of reactants into products. In this scenario, the initial concentration of reactants will not decrease – instead, it will either remain constant or even increase as products are transformed back into reactants at a higher rate. From this understanding, we can conclude that the reactants concentration would decrease in case A, where the forward reaction is favored. This is because, in case A, there is a higher rate of reactants being consumed to form products compared to the reverse reaction."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: Where do you store a salad bowl when not in use?

Therefore, if Steve had a winch made of steel cable, he would be able to use it to pull the tug."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of the person that historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437? The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded...

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"No, the answer provided does not give a synopsis of \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\". Here's a detailed and long synopsis for \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\": \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\", a self-help book by Dr. Spencer Johnson, focuses on how to manage change in one's personal and professional life. It tells the story of four characters: two mice named Sniff and Scurry and two miniature humans called Hem and Haw. The story is an allegory, representing how people react to change in their lives. The four characters live in a maze and search for cheese, their favorite food and metaphor for happiness, prosperity, or anything they desire. The cheese is a symbol for what we want in life, while the maze is the environment we navigate, whether it's our workplace, relationships, or community. At the beginning of the story, all four characters find a large cache of cheese at Cheese Station C. Sniff and Scurry keep sniffing for new cheese every day, whereas Hem and Haw grow complacent and believe that the cheese supply will not diminish. One day, the cheese at Cheese Station C runs out. Sniff and Scurry are not surprised and immediately begin their search for new cheese. In contrast, Hem and Haw are shocked, angry, and unable to understand how this could happen since they were so sure that the cheese would be there forever. Hem and Haw keep revisiting Cheese Station C, hoping that the cheese will miraculously reappear. Meanwhile, Sniff and Scurry venture into the maze, overcoming obstacles, sniffing out new paths, and eventually discovering a bountiful supply of cheese at Cheese Station N. As time progresses, Haw realizes that he must let go of his past beliefs and assumptions and step out of his comfort zone into the unknown if he is to find new cheese. Gradually, he leaves Hem behind and starts exploring the maze, learning valuable lessons and overcoming his fears along the way. When Haw finally comes across Cheese Station N, he rejoices in his newfound wisdom, realizing that change should be anticipated and embraced rather than feared. Hem remains unwilling to accept and adapt to change and stays stuck, hoping for the cheese to return to its old place. The book concludes with Haw making a series of statements that encapsulate the lessons he has learned. These lessons, referred to as the \\"Handwriting on the Wall,\\" are: 1. Change Happens - They keep moving the cheese. 2. Anticipate Change - Get ready for the cheese to move. 3. Monitor Change - Smell the cheese often, so you know when it's getting old. 4. Adapt To Change Quickly - The quicker you let go of the old cheese, the sooner you can enjoy the new cheese. 5. Change - Move with the cheese. 6. Enjoy Change! - Savor the adventure and enjoy the taste of new cheese! 7. Be Ready To Change Quickly And Enjoy It Again - They keep moving the cheese. Overall, \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" serves as an allegory for the importance of adapting to change, embracing new opportunities, and letting go of old ways in personal and professional life."},{"question":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\".

Over the course of his career, Smith played for two different professional football teams. 1. Dallas Cowboys (1990-2002) Emmitt Smith was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the 1990 NFL Draft. He played with the Cowboys for 13 seasons, from 1990 to 2002, and became the cornerstone of their running game throughout the 1990s, which is often considered one of the most successful decades in the history of the franchise. During his tenure with the Cowboys, Smith helped the team win three Super Bowl championships (Super Bowls XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX), and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in Super Bowl XXVIII. He was also an eight-time Pro Bowl selection (1990-1995, 1998, and 1999) and a four-time First Team All-Pro (1992-1995). Smith became the NFL's rushing leader on four occasions (1991, 1992, 1993, and 1995) and earned the NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 1993. In his time with the Cowboys, Smith set numerous franchise records, including most career rushing yards (17,162), most career rushing touchdowns (153), and most career 100-yard rushing games (76). 2. Arizona Cardinals (2003-2004) After spending 13 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, Emmitt Smith signed with the Arizona Cardinals as a free agent in 2003. He played for the Cardinals for two seasons (from 2003 to 2004). Although Smith's tenure with the Cardinals was not as successful as his time with the Cowboys, he still managed to amass 1,193 rushing yards and 11 rushing touchdowns during these two seasons. In his final year with the Cardinals, Smith recorded his 164th career touchdown, which at the time broke the record for most career touchdowns in NFL history. He retired after the 2004 NFL season. In 2010, Emmitt Smith was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest running backs to have ever played the game. Over the course of his career, Smith played in a total of 226 games, accumulating 18,355 rushing yards and 164 rushing touchdowns – both of which were NFL records at the time of his retirement, and his rushing yards record still stands today."},{"question":"Write a title: Twenty-nine North Koreans sought asylum Wednesday at a Japanese school in Beijing, hoping to ultimately reach South Korea, the Kyodo news agency reported.

What might be the first step of the process?","response":"The first step of the process is the bat emitting high-frequency sounds, usually through its mouth or nostrils. These sounds are called echolocation calls or simply \\"calls,\\" and they are typically beyond the range of human hearing. When a bat emits these high-frequency sounds, they travel through the air as sound waves, and this initiates the echolocation process. Here is the entire process broken down step by step: 1. The bat emits high-frequency sounds (echolocation calls). 2. The sound waves travel through the air and hit an object, such as an insect or a tree branch. 3. The sound waves bounce off the object to produce echoes. 4. The echoes return through the air back to the bat's ears. 5. The bat hears the echo and processes the information it contains. 6. The bat can then discern the location, size, shape, and movement of the object based on the properties of the echo, such as its time delay and frequency shifts. This echolocation process allows bats to navigate, forage, and avoid obstacles effectively in complete darkness."},{"question":"Leo: Test for natural language inference.

He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House.

As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania, where as quarterback, he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. Context: By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles. After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4-7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born. In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted 85,000 (presently, 1,499,017), and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of 4,500 (presently, 79,360). Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles, wherein Bell led the Eagles to a 1-11 finish, their worst record ever. In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. During the Eagles' 2-8-1 1937 season, his second child, John \\"Upton\\", was born. In the Eagles' first profitable season, 1938, they posted a 5-6 record. The Eagles finished 1-9-1 in 1939 and 1-10 in 1940. Question: Did they ever have a winning record while Bell was the owner?. Whats the answer?","response":"While Bert Bell was the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, they did not have a winning record. Throughout their seasons from 1933 to 1940, the Eagles struggled with their performance and did not achieve a winning record during this time."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The Tang period was a golden age of Chinese literature and art. There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Cui Hao (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with \\"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (騙體文, \\"parallel prose\\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.

Article: It can be dangerous to travel by sea. Ships sometimes sink far away from land. When this happens, the sailors have to get into small boats. If another ship does not come and help them and they do not have enough food or water, they will die. Most people believe we must not drink sea water. They believe that if we do, we shall be very ill because of all the salt in the water. A doctor called Alain Bombard did not believe this. He thought that people could stay alive by drinking sea water and eating small fish, animals and plants from the sea. On 19 October 1953, he set out in a small boat to cross the Atlantic Ocean . He did not take any food or water with him. Every day Dr. Bombard drank just a little sea water. He also caught fish and they had water in them. He drank this water. He could not cook the fish, so he ate them as they were. He took small plants from the sea, which gave him more food. Dr. Bombard became hot, tired and quite ill, but after 65days at sea he was still alive. He traveled 2,750 miles from one side of the Atlantic Ocean to the other, and on 24th,December 1953, he reached Barbados.

Hooper was born on August 24, 1887, in Bell Station, California. His family had migrated to California as many other families from the United States due to the California Gold Rush. His father, Joseph \\"Joe\\" Hooper, was born in Morrell, Prince Edward Island in Canada. Joe was the fourth child and second boy born to English-born William Hooper, Harry's grandfather, and his Portuguese wife Louisa. Breaking into the majors with the Red Sox in 1909, Hooper played in 81 games and hit .282. Between 1910 and 1915, he teamed with Tris Speaker (CF) and Duffy Lewis (LF) to form the Golden Outfield, one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Religious differences may have been the biggest challenge for the Golden Outfield. At the time, a common Protestant sentiment was that Catholics would move to their communities and change the established culture. Speaker, who was a Protestant, once went a year without speaking to Hooper or Lewis, who were both Catholic. Though Hooper was a hard competitor on the field, he became known for his likable personality and sense of humor, which contrasted with Speaker's tough exterior. Hooper became a favorite with the fans and he established a reputation as a clutch player. He became known as a top-caliber defensive right fielder and a solid leadoff hitter. He invented a maneuver known as the \\"rump-slide\\" for catching shallow fly balls. In 1910 Hooper played 155 games and hit .267 in a league-leading 688 plate appearances, marking the first of eleven consecutive seasons where he had at least 564 plate appearances. He led all AL outfielders with 30 assists that season, but he also committed a league-high 18 errors. In 130 games the next year, Hooper hit .311; the outfield trio of Hooper, Lewis and Speaker hit .315 combined. Hooper's batting average dropped to .242 in 1912. Boston won the 1912 World Series, during which Hooper made a catch that The Pittsburgh Press referred to as one of the finest plays in baseball history. The paper noted that Hooper \\"does not seek the limelight. He is reserved and bashful, and every action of his upon the baseball field plainly shows these qualities.\\" On May 30, 1913, Hooper became the first player to hit a home run to lead off both games of a doubleheader, a mark only matched by Rickey Henderson and Brady Anderson over 80 years later. In 1914, he recorded 230 putouts in right field, which was the first of several seasons in which he finished in the top three in that category among right fielders. On October 13, 1915, in game five of the 1915 World Series, he became the second player to hit two home runs in a single World Series game. Duffy contributed a third home run as the Red Sox won another world championship four games to one. Hooper was also the captain of the Red Sox in 1919. Hooper became known for talking Boston manager Ed Barrow into converting Babe Ruth from a pitcher to an outfielder.","response":"This text is about Harry Bartholomew Hooper, a professional baseball player, born on August 24, 1887, in Bell Station, California.

Hypothesis: After a quarter of an hour people are more likely to die when in an avalanche OPTIONS: + Yes. + It's impossible to say. + No.","response":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that after a quarter of an hour, people are more likely to die when in an avalanche from the given context. The context highlights the importance of time in avalanche companion rescue situations and emphasizes that survival chances drop dramatically after the first 15 minutes. This statement indicates a strong correlation between the time taken to find and extricate victims and their likelihood of survival, suggesting that the critical threshold for rescue is within the first 15 minutes after being buried in an avalanche. Wearable sensing technologies aim to enhance the rescue process by improving the chances of locating and extricating victims within this critical timeframe. The faster a victim can be found and freed from the avalanche, the higher their chances of survival. Beyond the first 15 minutes, the probability of survival decreases significantly due to factors such as suffocation, hypothermia, and physical injuries caused by the force of the avalanche. In summary, based on the given context, we can infer and support the hypothesis that \\"After a quarter of an hour, people are more likely to die when in an avalanche.\\" This hypothesis emphasizes the significance of rapid response and effective rescue technologies in increasing the likelihood of victims' survival in avalanche situations."},{"question":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Concrete cures best in temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C), so check the forecast for the next week. If you can expect warm temperatures, then now is the right time to pour the concrete. Pouring in the spring or summer is ideal to avoid any unexpected cold weather. If there is a sudden cold snap after pouring the concrete, professionals usually protect the concrete by building a structure around the site and using a portable heater. This is an expensive option, but it’s the best choice to protect the concrete. While the concrete is curing, it can’t handle excessive weight. Let it dry for a full 24 hours before stepping on it to prevent damage to the surface. If you’re water-curing the concrete, take extra care to avoid stepping on it while you re-wet the fabric. If the concrete is in an area with a lot of foot traffic, block the area off and hang signs warning about wet cement. Make sure any pedestrians will know they can't step on the area. Even if the concrete looks dry, it can't handle excessive weight until after it cures completely. If the concrete is in your driveway or a similar area that cars drive on, wait at least 10 days before driving or parking your car on it. If you have a large vehicle like an RV or truck, wait 28 days before parking it on the concrete. Also wait 28 days if this is a commercial area with a lot of vehicle traffic, like a parking lot. The weight from multiple vehicles can cause the concrete to sink. Introducing new chemicals to the concrete before it’s completely hardened can interfere with the curing process. Wait a full month before applying any paints or stains to the concrete. If you do want to paint the concrete and used a curing compound, remember to get one that is nonreactive with paint.

Given these facts, a plant requires what to grow among the following options: - Something that is created on Mars - Something made primarily of oxygen and nitrogen - Something that is found on Jupiter - Something that take eight minutes to travel to the Earth - Basic units of the plant body. - keeping food fresh for long periods of time - Something that comes from the Moon - Something whose growth is discouraged by heavy wet soils","response":"A plant requires different resources to grow healthily, and among the options provided, a plant requires something made primarily of oxygen and nitrogen, something that takes eight minutes to travel to Earth, and basic units of the plant body. 1. Something made primarily of oxygen and nitrogen: Plants require a specific balance of gases, particularly oxygen and nitrogen, to grow. The Earth's atmosphere is composed of roughly 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, which makes up 99% of the air we breathe. Nitrogen is an essential element for the growth of plants because it is a key component of chlorophyll, which is responsible for the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process in which plants convert sunlight into energy for food and growth. Oxygen is also essential for plants because it is required for cellular respiration, which is the process by which plants use oxygen to release energy from stored carbohydrates during the night when photosynthesis is not happening. 2. Something that takes eight minutes to travel to the Earth: This refers to sunlight, which is crucial for plant growth. As mentioned earlier, sunlight plays a pivotal role in photosynthesis. Without sunlight, plants would be unable to produce food and grow. Photosynthesis involves the conversion of sunlight into energy that can be used by the plant for growth by transforming carbon dioxide and water into glucose. The glucose is then used by the plant as an energy source and to build new tissues. The sunlight's role in the process of photosynthesis is absolutely essential for the life and growth of a plant. 3. Basic units of the plant body: The basic units of the plant body are cells, which are the building blocks of all organisms. Cells in plants are specialized and comprise various structures, such as the cell wall, nucleus, and chloroplasts. Plants are made up of a series of interconnected cells that form tissues, organs, and organ systems. The primary organs of a plant are the roots, stems, and leaves which all work together to support the plant's overall growth and development. Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil, stems provide structural support and transport water and nutrients throughout the plant, and leaves perform photosynthesis and carry out gas exchange. In summary, for a plant to grow and thrive, it primarily requires an environment rich in oxygen and nitrogen, ample sunlight for photosynthesis, and the basic building blocks found in its cells. Other factors such as soil type, water availability, and temperature also contribute to the overall health and growth of a plant, but the aforementioned resources are paramount for successful plant development."},{"question":"Here is some data: A.F.C.

A:","response":"In the movie \\"Our Man Flint,\\" the character Flint, played by James Coburn, is a skilled and multi-talented secret agent. He is known for his wide array of unique abilities and impressive gadgets. Cramden, who is Flint's former commander in the military and the head honcho in the movie, refers to Flint's extraordinary abilities that could potentially set world records. One example of Flint's record-setting skills is his ability to perform seemingly impossible feats with his cigarette lighter. Flint's cigarette lighter has multiple functions and is far more advanced than the briefcase offered by Cramden. Some of these functions include serving as a homing device, a cutting tool, and even a weapon. These versatile and advanced features of Flint's cigarette lighter showcase his creativity and expertise in developing gadgets, which could potentially be a world record as implied by Cramden. Another example of Flint's potential record-setting skills is his exceptional combat abilities. He is shown to excel in martial arts and is able to defeat multiple black belts singlehandedly. This demonstrates his impressive physical prowess and expertise in hand-to-hand combat, again suggesting that his skills may be worthy of a world record. Additionally, Flint has an extraordinary ability to seduce and charm women, which is showcased in the movie through his various encounters with different female characters. He is depicted as having a considerable number of women attending to his needs and fulfilling his desires, further suggesting an unparalleled level of charm and appeal that could be perceived as a world record.

Answer: A cow is an animal, while a man and a girl are human beings."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator) is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences (of either a formal or a natural language) in a grammatically valid way, such that the sense of the compound sentence produced depends only on the original sentences. - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\". - In logic, a substructural logic is a logic lacking one of the usual structural rules (e.g. of classical and intuitionistic logic), such as weakening, contraction, exchange or associativity. Two of the more significant substructural logics are relevant logic and linear logic. - In mathematical logic, a sequent is a very general kind of conditional assertion. - In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theoremsand generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally \\"deductive\\", in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is \\"experimental\\". - In logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called \\"modus ponens\\" takes two premises, one in the form \\"If p then q\\" and another in the form \\"p\\", and returns the conclusion \\"q\\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion. - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. - In proof theory, a structural rule is an inference rule that does not refer to any logical connective, but instead operates on the judgment or sequents directly. Structural rules often mimic intended meta-theoretic properties of the logic. Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics. - Idempotency of entailment is a property of logical systems that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one . This property can be captured by a structural rule called contraction , and in such systems one may say that entailment is idempotent if and only if contraction is an admissible rule . Rule of Contraction : from A , C , C B is derived A , C B. Or in sequent calculus notation , frac ( Gamma , C , C vdash B ) ( Gamma , C vdash B ) - In logic, a rule of inference is admissible in a formal system if the set of theorems of the system does not change when that rule is added to the existing rules of the system. In other words, every formula that can be derived using that rule is already derivable without that rule, so, in a sense, it is redundant. The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955). - Paul Lorenzen (March 24, 1915 October 1, 1994) was a German philosopher and mathematician, founder of the Erlangen School (with Wilhelm Kamlah) and inventor of game semantics (with Kuno Lorenz). 'idempotency of entailment' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'? Choices: - argument - assertion - branch - ethics - exchange - formal system - judgment - language - logic - logical connective - march - mathematics - model - natural language - notion - operator - plain - rule - scientific law - sense - symbol - theorem - theory - two - word Answer:","response":"'Idempotency of entailment' is related to the object entity 'rule' through the relation of 'instance of'. This is because idempotency of entailment is a property of logical systems that can be represented by a specific rule called the rule of contraction. In this context, the idempotency of entailment is an instance of a rule that governs the behavior and properties of logical systems. Rules, in general, are crucial components in formal systems, serving as the foundation for valid inferences, deductions, and manipulations of semantic elements. As a brief recap, 'idempotency of entailment' is a structural property of logical systems that states that deriving the same consequences from multiple instances of a hypothesis is equivalent to deriving those consequences from a single instance of that hypothesis. This property is captured by the rule of contraction, which allows for the simplification of sequents (conditional assertions) by removing redundant instances of a hypothesis. Consequently, this rule, and thus the concept of idempotency of entailment, has a critical role to play in the study and understanding of formal systems and mathematical logic."},{"question":"What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who refused Disney's request to rewrite the song for the film Dinosaur? from the following article ?

Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. and the situation: Dan visited Twin lakes every year.

The end."},{"question":"Summarize this article: There are many tables that have information on the average bond energies for a specific bond. These tables can be found online or in a chemistry book. It is important to note that these bond energies are always for molecules in a gaseous state. For our example, you need to find the bond energy for an H-H bond, a Br-Br bond, and an H-Br bond. H-H = 436 kJ/mol; Br-Br = 193 kJ/mol; H-Br = 366 kJ/mol. To calculate bond energy for molecules in a liquid state, you need to also look up the enthalpy change of vaporization for the liquid molecule. This is the amount of energy needed to convert the liquid into a gas. This number is added to the total bond energy. For example: If you were given liquid water, you would need to add the enthalpy change of vaporization of water (+41 kJ) to the equation. In some equations, you may have the same bond broken multiple times. For example, if 4 atoms of hydrogen are in the molecule, then the bond energy of hydrogen must be counted 4 times, or multiplied by 4. In our example, there is only 1 bond of each molecule, so the bond energies are simply multiplied by 1. H-H = 436 x 1 = 436 kJ/mol Br-Br = 193 x 1 = 193 kJ/mol Once you have multiplied the bond energies by the number of the individual bonds, you need to then sum all of the bonds on the reactant side. For our example, the sum of the bonds broken is H-H + Br-Br = 436 + 193 = 629 kJ/mol. Just as you did for the bonds broken on the reactant side, you will multiply the number of bonds formed by its respective bond energy. If you have 4 hydrogen bonds formed, you would need to multiply that bond energy by 4. For our example we have 2 H-Br bonds formed, so the bond energy of H-Br (366 kJ/mol) will be multiplied by 2: 366 x 2 = 732 kJ/mol. Again, like you did with the bonds broken, you will add up all of the bonds formed on the product side. Sometimes you will only have 1 product formed and can skip this step. In our example, there is only 1 product formed, so the energy of the bonds formed is simply the energy of the 2 H-Br bonds or 732 kJ/mol. Once you have summed all of the bond energies for both sides, simply subtract the formed bonds from the broken bonds. Remember the equation: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). Plug in the calculated values and subtract. For our example: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed) = 629 kJ/mol - 732 kJ/mol = -103 kJ/mol. The final step to calculating bond energy is to determine whether the reaction releases energy or consumes energy. An endothermic (one that consumes energy) will have a final bond energy that is positive, while an exothermic reaction (one that releases energy) will have a negative bond energy. In our example, the final bond energy is negative, therefore, the reaction is exothermic. Summary:","response":"This article discusses the process of calculating bond energies for specific chemical bonds, using an H-H bond, a Br-Br bond, and an H-Br bond as examples. Bond energy tables, which provide average bond energy values, can be found online or in chemistry books. It is essential to remember that these values pertain to gaseous molecules. To calculate bond energy for liquid molecules, the enthalpy change of vaporization must be added to the total bond energy. In cases where the same bond is broken multiple times, the bond energy must be multiplied by the number of occurrences. The bond energies of broken and formed bonds must be summed separately, with the overall bond energy determined by subtracting the formed bonds' energy from the broken bonds' energy. A positive final bond energy signifies an endothermic reaction, which consumes energy, while a negative final bond energy indicates an exothermic reaction, which releases energy. In the given example, the reaction is determined to be exothermic due to its negative final bond energy."},{"question":"Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Which lake will have less dead zones?","response":"Lake Costanza will likely have less dead zones. Since it hardly gets any rain, there is less chance of rain dissolving the fertilizer in the soil and causing runoff to carry the fertilizer into the lake. This would result in less nitrogen entering the lake, reducing the chances of an algal bloom and a subsequent dead zone. On the other hand, Lake Montopeke experiences regular rainfall, which increases the likelihood of fertilizer runoff and associated dead zones."},{"question":"Premise: (Well, actually, he goes on to argue in a similar fashion against the logical plausibility of free speech, academic freedom, and blind justice.)

The food was pretty good, though, maybe a 3. First, we lined up outside. It felt a little bit like waiting for a ride at the state fair. You really had no idea what was happening, how seating worked, etc, until you got closer. They had a waitress taking bar orders in line, which frankly is the only reason I stayed at that point. However, you had to close your tab at the time of service. Once you get in to the counter to order, still not clear on what is going on, you've paid one bill (for the drinks) and are now carrying a massive goblet of beer. You order, are told what # booth you've been granted, and pay again. If you want water, you are given a cup at that time. So, now you've paid twice and are walking around with two beverages in your hand looking for your booth number. The food came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately, requesting another beverage now means yet another bill I have to pay. Honestly, I really wanted this place to work. I like the look and the vibe it has. But please, get a proper hostess and seat people normally. Let the waitstaff you've already hired take orders from the table. Get rid of the whole line thing. It's unnecessary and kind of a pain.

This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the Burning of books and burying of scholars of 212 BC, the Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for Chinese pagoda towers, engineering, surveying, and includes material on right triangles. It created mathematical proof for the Pythagorean theorem, and a mathematical formula for Gaussian elimination. The treatise also provides values of π, which Chinese mathematicians originally approximated as 3 until Liu Xin (scholar) (d. 23 AD) provided a figure of 3.1457 and subsequently Zhang Heng (78-139) approximated pi as 3.1724, as well as 3.162 by taking the square root of 10. Liu Hui commented on the Nine Chapters in the 3rd century AD and Liu Huis π algorithm accurate to 5 decimal places (i.e. 3.14159). Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD Zu Chongzhi computed Milü to seven decimal places (i.e. 3.141592), which remained the most accurate value of π for almost the next 1000 years.

PUBLISHED:. 16:24 EST, 5 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 16:24 EST, 5 October 2012. Tax avoidance: Anne Robinson, pictured, has avoided paying £4million after joining the Liberty tax strategy, it was claimed. Anne Robinson avoided paying tax on £4million after joining an aggressive scheme to shelter earnings from the Treasury, it was claimed yesterday. The BBC Watchdog presenter was one of the largest participants in the Liberty tax strategy which enabled investors to pay just 7p in the pound to the company rather than 40 per cent income tax. Take That stars Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen were also reported to be among the 2,000 who tried to shelter a total of £1.2billion from the taxman in the scheme between 2004 and 2008. It is the latest revelation about legal but aggressive tax avoidance schemes used by celebrities and the super-rich which the Prime Minister has described as ‘morally repugnant’. HM Revenue and Customs believe that personal tax avoidance costs the economy £4.5billion a year. Liberty exploited a loophole to buy and sell dividends offshore to generate more than £1billion in artificial losses which members could offset against their tax bills. It meant higher-rate taxpayers could earn £1million a year tax free by paying £70,000 in fees to Leeds company Mercury Tax Strategies, which provided the scheme. Miss Robinson, 68, was reported to have avoided tax on about £4million through Liberty after paying £280,000 in fees. Barlow attempted to shelter at least £3million after paying £210,000, Owen attempted to shelter at least £1.4million after paying £101,500, and Donald attempted to shelter £2.1million after paying £147,000. In total, Liberty was used to shelter an average of £300million a year between 2004 and 2008. It was first investigated by the Inland Revenue 2006 and was eventually shut down in April 2008 when legislation was brought in to close the loophole. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is taking it to a tax tribunal in spring, but it is unclear whether any of the beneficiaries will be made to pay any avoided tax. Comedian Jimmy Carr was forced to apologise earlier this year after it was revealed he put his earnings into a Jersey-based avoidance scheme called K2, which cut the income tax liability of participants to as little as one per cent. The BBC, pictured in Salford, hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax. Miss Robinson has hosted BBC’s Watchdog for more than a decade, presenting herself as a crusader for ordinary consumers. She reportedly earned £6million for a two-year contract with the BBC for presenting The Weakest Link. Yesterday it emerged that the BBC hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax. The arrangements include 148 news presenters such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman. Mercury Tax Strategies, the provider of the Liberty scheme, declined to comment yesterday. Miss Robinson, Barlow, Donald and Owen all failed to respond to requests to comment. HMRC said it couldn’t comment on individual cases. A spokesman said: ‘It does sometimes take a long time for cases to be investigated. This is why we advise anyone who thinks about using a tax avoidance scheme that they should be prepared to be subject to an in-depth enquiry.’ Highlights:","response":"1.

He is held to be exchanged for a IRA prisoner the British are holding. During the three days Jody is held, he and Fergus become friendly as they talk about their lives and Ferguson shows care by removing the canvass sack on his head. Jody tells Fergus about his girlfriend back in London named Dil. Jody says she is his type of woman. Jody tells Fergus he won't shoot him when it's time because it's not in Fergus' nature. He tells him a parable about the scorpion and the frog. The scorpion asks the frog to take him across the river because the scorpion can't swim. The frog says no because you'll sting me. The scorpion says trust me. Half way across, the frog feels a sharp sting and says to the scorpion as they sink, why did you sting me? Now we'll both drown. I couldn't help it, said the scorpion, it's in my nature. Jody has Ferguson take his wallet with Dil's picture and asks him to go to her place of work or local bar and tell her he was thinking of her at the end.

CE DISQUE EST UNE PURE MERVEILLE, RIEN DE MOINS. . Attention, arrêtez tout, laissez cramer le steak, déborder le bain, brailler la marmaille, sonner le facteur (pas d'inquiétude, il re sonnera...), la seule urgence du moment est de vous procurer cet enregistrement de Peter Green HOT FOOT POWDER, reprenant des chansons de Robert Johnson. Peter Green, après avoir gratté chez les Bluesbreaker de John Mayall, fonde Fleetwood Mac en 1967 - la première formation, celle qui jouait du blues sous acide, pas la seconde mouture Rock FM. Sa sensibilité, sa peur de la notoriété, et ses addictions diverses, mettent à mal sa santé, et Peter Green se retire de la musique, pour fréquenter les hôpitaux psychiatriques. Robert Johnson (1911 - 1938) le plus célèbre des pères fondateurs du Delta blues, auteur à lui tout seul de 50% du répertoire blues et dont on disait qu'il pactisât avec le diable pour jouer aussi bien de la guitare... Il est mort empoisonné par un mari jaloux, ou de la syphilis, c'est selon... L'intégrale Robert Johnson tient sur un album, ne vous en privez pas. En 1998, Peter Green s'empare une première fois du répertoire de Johnson, avec ROBERT JOHNSON SONGBOOK, et fort de ce succès, remet ça deux ans plus tard avec d'autres titres, sur ce HOT FOOT POWDER. Le résultat est tout bonnement fantastique. Du blues pur et dur, tantôt acoustique ou électrique, mais sans aucune esbroufe, à la cool, du soft blues, avec un son live et dépouillé qui rend hommage aux originaux, tout en étant contemporain. Peter Green s'est entouré de quelques invités, parmi les lesquels Buddy Guy, Dr John, Otis Rush, Joe Louis Walker... N'en jetez plus ! La voix de Peter Green est douce, veloutée, et peut rappeler Eric Clapton sur certains morceaux comme « Malted Milk » d'ailleurs repris par Clapton sur son UNPLUGGED. « Drunken hearted man » a été repris par The Allman's Brother sur leur LIVE AT FILLMORE, et « Crossroad » reste un des plus grands classiques du genre (avec « Stormy Monday » de T Bone Walker). Treize titres pour 42 minutes, c'est court, mais c'est sublime. Une anecdote blues ? J'ai entendu récemment « Sweet home Chicago » chanté par Robert Jonson, et dont les paroles sont différentes de la célèbre version des Blues Brothers. Johnson chante : « Come on, baby don't you wanna go, to the land of California, Sweet home Chicago ». Johnson, qui n'a jamais quitté ou presque son Mississippi, rêve à la fois de la dorée Californie, et de la ville de Chicago déjà célèbre pour ses clubs de musique. Mais la géographie n'étant pas son fort, il associe les deux dans son texte. Les artistes qui reprennent sa chanson aujourd'hui, corrige cette (jolie) erreur, en chantant \\"down to the same old place, my sweet home, Chicago\\"... Vous pouvez recommencer à respirer.

Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group's attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley (12th U.S. Army Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. Army Group) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical, though sometimes ineffective, latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Eisenhower's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944, and victory became a more distinct probability. Who was the Sixth US Army Group's commander? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"The Sixth US Army Group's commander was General Jacob L.

By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school.

It is also one of the world's most modern cities. Twice last century, the city was destroyed and rebuilt. In 1923 a major earthquake struck the city. Thousands of people were killed and millions were left homeless as buildings collapsed and fires broke out throughout Tokyo. It took seven years to rebuild the city. During World War II, Tokyo was destroyed once again. As a result of these disasters, there is nothing of old Tokyo remaining in the downtown area. After the war, the people of Tokyo began to rebuild their city. Buildings went up at a fantastic rate, and between1945 and 1960, the city's population more than doubled. Because of the Olympic Games held in Tokyo in 1964, many new stadiums, parks and hotels were built to treat visitors from all over the world. As a result of this rapid development, however, many problems have risen.

More than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of 294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006. The history of breweries has been one of absorbing smaller breweries in order to ensure economy of scale. In 2002 South African Breweries bought the North American Miller Brewing Company to found SABMiller, becoming the second largest brewery, after North American Anheuser-Bush. In 2004 the Belgian Interbrew was the third largest brewery by volume and the Brazilian AmBev was the fifth largest. They merged into InBev, becoming the largest brewery. In 2007, SABMiller surpassed InBev and Anheuser-Bush when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand Grolsch in 2007. In 2008, InBev (the second-largest) bought Anheuser-Busch (the third largest), the new Anheuser-Busch InBev company became again the largest brewer in the world. As of 2015[update] AB InBev is the largest brewery, with SABMiller second, and Heineken International third.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"Grolsch is a Dutch premium beer brand that occupies a significant position in the brewing industry. Its acquisition by SABMiller in 2007 helped the company surpass its competitors, InBev and Anheuser-Busch, and become the largest brewery in the world at that time. The brand Grolsch is now a part of the brewing industry's highly competitive landscape, which consists of dominant multinational companies and smaller producers. In addition to its noteworthy merger with SABMiller, Grolsch's market position has been shaped by several other key factors. It is essential to consider its historical and cultural significance in the Netherlands and beyond. Established in 1615, Grolsch has a rich, centuries-long tradition of producing high-quality premium beer. This history has allowed the brand to cultivate a strong identity and consumer loyalty, contributing to its market position. Furthermore, Grolsch's unique taste and distinctive packaging, particularly its iconic swing-top bottle, have become closely associated with the brand. In a crowded and competitive market, such distinctive branding helps Grolsch stand out and maintain its market share. The brewing industry has experienced massive consolidation over the years, with a strong focus on economies of scale. Numerous strategic mergers and acquisitions have taken place, including the 2002 founding of SABMiller after the purchase of North American Miller Brewing Company by South African Breweries, and the 2004 merger of Belgian Interbrew and Brazilian AmBev to form InBev. Ultimately, Grolsch's position in the market today is a result of its historical legacy, unique branding, and strategic ties with larger brewing conglomerates. After the acquisition by SABMiller in 2007, the brand became a part of the brewing industry's hierarchy, contributing to SABMiller earning the title of the world's largest brewery at that time. However, it should also be noted that, as of 2015, AB InBev is now the largest brewery, with SABMiller in the second position and Heineken International in the third. As a result, Grolsch stands as a well-regarded premium beer brand within this global brewing industry structure, supported by a strong history and an association with prominent brewing companies."},{"question":"Write a brief sentence.","response":"A short sentence is a group of words that tells us something, like \\"The cat is fluffy.\\""},{"question":"What is the answer: The sports teams from Auburn University, LSU, Princeton University, and University of Missouri all use the same name.

No While it is true that Haplocyonoides belongs to the family Amphicyonidae, also known as \\"bear dogs,\\" it is not accurate to infer that they were very large, almost as large as the Saber tooth Tiger, based solely on this information. The family Amphicyonidae covered a wide range of sizes and ecological niches, from small, fox-sized species to large, bear-sized carnivores. Haplocyonoides, as an extinct genus within this family, would have had its own unique characteristics and adaptations suited to its specific environment and ecological role during its existence in the Early Miocene epoch. To infer the size of Haplocyonoides accurately, one would need to rely on fossil evidence, such as the discovery of well-preserved skeletal remains that could provide information on its body size and structure. Additionally, studying the morphology and ecology of closely related genera within the Amphicyonidae family could help provide better insights into the size and characteristics of Haplocyonoides. In summary, without further detailed information on Haplocyonoides' fossil record and the specific characteristics of the genus, it is not accurate to infer that they were very large, almost as large as the Saber tooth Tiger.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: But following a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the 42-year-old vendor has turned to making plastic face shields for frontline medical workers instead. “I was once a patient myself and I feel like my family owes doctors a lot”, said Linh, who received hospital treatment a few years ago for a blood-related illness. “I want to make these shields to keep them healthy. If they are healthy, then they can protect us”. Last week, Vietnam began a 15-day social distancing campaign to slow the spread of the virus that has seen most non-essential businesses shut, including Linh’s stall. There have been 241 reported cases of the coronavirus in Vietnam and no reported deaths, according to the health ministry. Aggressive contact tracing and a mass quarantine programme have helped keep that tally low. When the lockdown began, Linh assembled a group of family members, friends and fellow vendors to start making the face shields. They can be worn in addition to face masks to better protect medical workers from the tiny virus-carrying droplets released by infected patients. In just a few days, Linh and her gang of volunteers made almost 1,000 face shields, she said, and distributed them to at least three nearby hospitals. Linh said she had drawn on her experience as a hat vendor to line the shields with comfortable padding. She watched media reports of doctors in the United States and consulted a friend who works as a nurse there to perfect the design, she said. The finishing touch? A sticker, with an important message to Vietnam’s medical workers: “Fight Covid-19 disease”. “Keep believing, because we are always with you”.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. Question: \\"What allowed the Anasazi to live in permanent shelters?\\" Answer: \\"A newly discovered river\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"No, the answer is not correct. The Anasazi were able to live in permanent shelters due to their use of formal agricultural techniques like irrigation to assist their harvest, which allowed them to be less reliant on following wildlife for subsistence."},{"question":"denting president barack obama 's hopes for a powerful ally in his campaign to press iran on its nuclear program , russia 's foreign minister said tuesday that threatening tehran now with harsh new sanctions would be \`\` counterproductive .

The jobs vary but include a number of IT and administrative positions. MD Anderson's potential interest in employing laid off Enron employees came to our attention via Anne Marie Giltrop of MD Anderson who spoke with Angela Davis. This morning, I spoke with Ms. Giltrop. In light of our policy of only providing neutral references and other liability considerations, I stated that I did not believe we would provide MD Anderson a list of employees who were laid off, but that I would try to find an approved vehicle for getting information regarding job openings at MD Anderson to our former employees. The MD Anderson web site does not reflect all current open positions, so I suggested that, if approved on both ends, MD Anderson could provide a list of openings with job descriptions that could be made available to former Enron employees. Ms. Giltrop is attempting to obtain appropriate approval from MD Anderson. She later phoned to inform me that I should expect to hear more from Deborah Manning, Jim Dorn, or Martha Jones. On our end, I have contacted David Oxley who put me in touch with Cindy Olson. Sarah Davis will now handle coordinating relations with MD Anderson.

Answer: The first Europeans to encounter the bird misidentified it as a guineafowl, a bird known as a \\"turkey fowl\\" at that time because it had been introduced into Europe via Turkey. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","response":"Answer: The modern-day turkey, scientifically known as Meleagris gallopavo, is suspected to have evolved from two primary ancestral species, which are as follows: 1. Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo: This subspecies is considered the primary ancestor of the domesticated turkey we know today. The Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo is native to the central and eastern parts of the United States and into parts of Mexico. It was initially domesticated by the indigenous peoples of Mexico around 800-1000 AD, which led to the eventual development of modern domesticated turkeys. 2. Meleagris gallopavo silvestris: This is the wild turkey subspecies native to the forests of North America, ranging from the northern parts of the United States to the central regions of Mexico. Although it is not considered as a direct ancestor of domesticated turkeys, its genetic material has been incorporated into modern breeds through interbreeding over the centuries. Thus, the recent day turkey is suspected to have embarked mainly from two species, Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo and Meleagris gallopavo silvestris. The domestication processes and selective breeding have played a crucial role in establishing modern turkey varieties. These practices have made them different in appearance and temperament from their wild ancestors. As for the confusion associating turkeys with the guineafowl as mentioned earlier, it was due in part to the guineafowl being introduced to Europe via trade routes through Turkey. However, genetically, the turkey (Meleagrididae family) and guineafowl (Numididae family) belong to different families within the Galliformes order, and they have separate evolutionary origins."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question New Caledonia is a major source for nickel and contains roughly 10% of the worlds known nickel supply. The islands contain about 7,100,000 tonnes of nickel. With the annual production of about 107,000 tonnes in 2009, New Caledonia was the Nickel mining in New Caledonia after Russia (266,000), Indonesia (189,000), Canada (181,000) and Australia (167,000). In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing financial crisis of 2007–2008. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. In the 2000s, large additions were made to nickel mining capacity. The Goro, New Caledonia is expected to be one of the largest nickel producing plants on Earth. When full-scale production begins in 2013 this plant will produce an estimated 20% of the global nickel supply. However, the need to respond to environmental concerns over the countrys globally recognized ecological heritage, may increasingly need to be factored into capitalization of mining operations. How many percent of the world's nickel supply is New Caledonia not responsible for?","response":"New Caledonia contains roughly 10% of the world's known nickel supply. Therefore, New Caledonia is not responsible for the other 90% of the world's nickel supply."},{"question":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: no","response":"Question: Is it possible for humans to breathe naturally in outer space without any protective gear or equipment? Reasoning: The environment in outer space is fundamentally different from that of Earth, as it lacks the air and atmospheric pressure needed for humans to survive. In outer space, there is no oxygen to breathe, and the extremely low pressure would cause the human body to quickly experience fatal effects like decompression sickness, hypoxia, and cellular damage. This is why people need to wear spacesuits and other protective gear when they venture into space, as these are specially designed to provide a contained environment that supplies oxygen, maintains pressure, and shields from radiation. So, no, it is not possible for humans to breathe naturally in outer space without any protective gear or equipment."},{"question":"Student: Premise: \\"A snowy city with an advertisement of a shirtless man.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"There is snow outside.\\" is true?

This shows that the percentage of minority students enrolling in higher education is directly affected by their proportion in the high school population. The study suggests that with a rise in the number of minority students in high schools, there is a corresponding increase in the representation of minority students in colleges and universities. Additionally, Long's report recognizes the role of class-based affirmative action policies, which differ from race-based affirmative action policies. Class-based affirmative action seeks to provide opportunities to students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, irrespective of their race. Long's study argues that the major beneficiaries of class-based affirmative action tend to be white students. This is because, in some cases, white students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may receive preference over minority students from comparatively better economic backgrounds. The distinction between race-based and class-based affirmative action is important here, as it clarifies the ways in which both policies can impact higher education enrollment. While race-based affirmative action specifically targets minority students, class-based affirmative action focuses more on students from lower-income families, which could include both minority and white students. By examining these factors, Long's report suggests that a combination of increasing minority enrollment in high schools and the effects of class-based affirmative action policies has led to the apparent rebounds in minority enrollment. In conclusion, Long's report explains the rebounds of minority enrollment through the analysis of two key factors: the rise in minority enrollment in high schools and the impact of class-based affirmative action policies primarily benefiting white students. These factors, taken together, offer an explanation for the observed trends in minority enrollment within the higher education landscape."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given news headlines and an edited word.

Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms.

One classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, where Romeo strings together thirteen in a row: do oxymorons have to be next to each other? Options are: (A). no; (B). yes;","response":"(A). No, oxymorons do not always have to be next to each other. An oxymoron is a rhetorical device that juxtaposes two seemingly contradictory words or concepts to create a paradoxical effect. These contrasting terms are often used to emphasize the complexity or tension within a particular situation, idea, or expression. While many oxymorons consist of an adjective-noun combination placed directly next to each other, they can also be found in phrases or sentences where the contradictory elements are separated by other words. Here are several examples of oxymorons and how they can appear in different contexts: 1. Adjective-Noun Combinations: - Bittersweet: This term combines the qualities of being both bitter and sweet at the same time, often used to describe mixed feelings or emotions. - Deafening silence: This oxymoron suggests a silence so intense that it is almost loud or overwhelming. 2. Phrases or Sentences: - \\"The more you try to forget something, the more you remember it.\\" This statement reveals an oxymoronic relationship between trying to forget and inadvertently remembering. - \\"Act natural.\\" This phrase suggests an inherent contradiction, as the act of attempting to appear natural might be seen as inherently unnatural or forced. 3. Separated by Other Words: - \\"This is an open secret.\\" Here, the words 'open' and 'secret' are contradictory, yet they are not placed directly next to each other, but still form an oxymoron. - \\"I am a deeply superficial person.\\" This quote, attributed to Andy Warhol, combines the contradictory elements of being both deep and superficial, separated by the words 'am' and 'a.' In all these examples, it is evident that oxymorons do not necessarily have to be next to each other to create a unique or paradoxical effect. They can be found in varying contexts and distances within language and literature, serving to emphasize the intricacies of human thought, emotion, or expression. Ultimately, as long as there is a sense of contradiction or paradox, an oxymoron can be considered effective, regardless of the exact positioning of the opposing terms."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sentence with a missing word, pick the answer option that best fills out the missing word in the sentence.

Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! Scientists think the color of sunlight on Venus is reddish-brown. Q: What are clouds on earth made of? A: A:","response":"Clouds on Earth are primarily composed of water vapor. They form when the air cools down, allowing water vapor to condense into visible water droplets or ice crystals, depending on the temperature and altitude. There are various types of clouds, such as cirrus, cumulus, and stratus clouds, which create diverse formations and appearances based on factors like altitude, atmospheric pressure, and temperature. In addition to water vapor, clouds on Earth may also contain other substances, such as dust particles, salt, pollutants, and organic materials. These particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), providing a surface for water vapor to condense. As a result, the formation of clouds is dependent on the presence of CCN and atmospheric conditions that facilitate the condensation of water vapor. The properties of clouds, including their density and altitude, help regulate the Earth's climate. They play a vital role in our planet's energy balance by reflecting sunlight back into space (increasing the Earth's albedo) and trapping the radiation emitted by the Earth's surface (causing the greenhouse effect). This delicate balance helps maintain our planet's habitable temperature range for the support of life. In summary, clouds on Earth are primarily made of water vapor, accompanied by various other substances like ice crystals, dust particles, salt, pollutants, and organic material, depending on the atmospheric conditions and cloud type. They play a significant role in shaping our planet's climate and supporting life on Earth."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Un estudio realizado en 1996 por Perotti examinó los canales a través de los cuales la desigualdad puede afectar el crecimiento económico. Demostró que, de acuerdo con el planteamiento de la imperfección del mercado crediticio, la desigualdad está relacionada con un menor nivel de formación de capital humano (educación, experiencia y aprendizaje) y un mayor nivel de fecundidad, y por lo tanto, menores niveles de crecimiento.

The band was formed in 1992 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Jim Root, Paul Gray, Craig Jones, Sid Wilson, Shawn Crahan, Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011-2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Context: Anticipation for Slipknot's second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001 and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled Iowa, Slipknot's second album - released on August 28, 2001 - peaked at number three on the Billboard charts and at number one in the UK. The album produced three singles; \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" (promotional single), \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"My Plague\\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the film Resident Evil. In 2002, Slipknot appeared in Rollerball (2002), performing \\"I Am Hated\\". The release and intense promotion of the album resulted in sold-out shows in large arenas in several countries. In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, the future of Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether there would be a third album, or if the split would become permanent. \\"I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot,\\" Jordison protested. \\"I've seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.\\" Nonetheless, on November 22, 2002, Slipknot released their second DVD, Disasterpieces. Preparation for Slipknot's fourth album began towards the end of 2007; work began at Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa, with producer Dave Fortman in February 2008. The album was finished in June, and the band the All Hope Is Gone World Tour on July 9, 2008. Slipknot's fourth album, All Hope Is Gone, was released on August 20, 2008, debuting at number one on the Billboard albums chart. The album produced five singles; \\"All Hope Is Gone\\", \\"Psychosocial\\", \\"Dead Memories\\", \\"Sulfur\\" and \\"Snuff\\". 2009 marked the 10th anniversary of Slipknot's debut album; to commemorate the event, the band released a special edition version of Slipknot on September 9, 2009. The band toured in support of the album throughout 2008 and continued until October 31, 2009, resulting in Slipknot's third hiatus. During the hiatus, several band members focused on respective side projects; Taylor founded Junk Beer Kidnap Band and returned to Stone Sour with guitarist Root; Crahan continued working with his band Dirty Little Rabbits; and drummer Jordison returned with his band Murderdolls and became the new permanent drummer of Rob Zombie. Percussionist Fehn is now a full-time bassist with metalcore band Will Haven and Sid Wilson founded the eponymous band Sid. In 2010, Gray was planning to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he was found dead in an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The day after his death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray's widow and brother. On June 21, the cause of death was confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and synthetic morphine substitute fentanyl. The band was hesitant to comment on the future of Slipknot. The members made conflicting statements in interviews; drummer Jordison told The Pulse of Radio \\"there is another Slipknot record already kinda in the making\\". Vocalist Taylor told FMQB Productions' he was \\"very conflicted about whether or not [he wants] to do anything with Slipknot\\". The band released their fourth video album (sic)nesses on September 28, 2010; it debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Music Video Charts. The DVD features Slipknot's entire live performance at the 2009 Download Festival and a 45-minute film documenting their tour in support of All Hope Is Gone, and served as a tribute to Paul Gray. Regarding the continuation of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue and he felt they should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing a small number of shows in Europe. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view. Slipknot also said the band would complete and release the band's fifth studio album, and that there were no plans to replace Gray. Jordison said the writing process for the album had already begun and that he had written 17 songs. Slipknot performed at the Mayhem Festival tour of 2012. On May 29, 2012, Roadrunner Records posted a teaser video titled Antennas to Hell on its website. Later that day, on Twitter, Corey Taylor said Slipknot will release a greatest hits album on June 17, 2012.

Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Please answer this question : Which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move? A:","response":"It is impossible to determine which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move based on the given information. Both cities are situated on plate boundaries and close to volcanoes, which suggests that they may both be subject to similar levels of convection and plate movement. However, Tree City experiences fewer earthquakes than Red City, which may imply that it is somewhat farther from the primary zone of plate interaction or has a different local geology that affects the frequency of earthquakes. Nonetheless, without more specific information about the actual geology and plate movements beneath each city, it is impossible to definitively conclude which city experienced less convection within the Earth."},{"question":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf.","response":"The missing first step of the following process is: A star, specifically a red giant, begins to exhaust its nuclear fuel, primarily hydrogen, in its core."},{"question":"When you wear sequin pants, allow them to get the attention they deserve; avoid lots of sparkly jewelry that draws attention away from them. Try to limit your jewelry to 1 or 2 carefully chosen items. For example, a simple long gold necklace over a plain black sweater with gold sequin pants would be plenty for the holidays. For jewelry with casual outfits, either avoid it or keep it fun and not sparkly: for example, bright plastic flower earrings with sequin jeans and a T-shirt and sneakers would complete a cute, casual look. To avoid a visually overwhelming outfit, your safest bet with shoes is to keep them plain when you’re wearing sequin pants. Wear plain black heels or flats for dressier occasions, and plain sneakers or sandals in black or white for casual wear. Low-top, flat sneakers tend to look better with sequin pants than high-tops; try a simple, solid color low-top to finish off a casual outfit with sequin leggings, joggers, or jeans. Unless you’re dressing for the holidays, always avoid wearing sequin shoes when you’re wearing sequin pants. If you decide to add sequin shoes for the holidays, make them a different color sequin, for example black sequin shoes with gold sequin pants. Be sure not to include sequin anywhere else in your outfit. Try wearing long hair up in a simple bun or ponytail when you’re wearing sequin pants. For shorter hair, just your regular loose style without accessories or too much volume will complete your look nicely. Avoid piling on lots of sparkly makeup when you’re wearing sequin pants; keep it limited to some simple eyeliner or mascara and matte lip color. Body glitter is a definite no-no when you’re wearing sequin pants, unless it’s Halloween or you’re going to a costume party. With sequin, less is more. If you’re wearing sequin pants casually, a plain, solid-color denim or bomber jacket would look great; a sequin bomber jacket would be too much. If you’re dressing up, a simple black peacoat would be a stylish addition to keep you warm. Try a simple black faux-leather jacket with your sequin pants for a casual, glam-rocker look. Also avoid pairing your sequin pants with other attention-grabbing dressy materials, such as fur. The overall effect of sequin with fur would be quite overwhelming even for a dressy event. Summary:","response":"To wear sequin pants properly and not overwhelm your overall appearance, consider the following tips: 1. Limit jewelry to 1 or 2 simple, non-sparkly pieces to avoid drawing attention away from the pants. 2. Choose plain shoes, such as black heels or flats for dressier occasions and sneakers or sandals in black or white for casual wear. Avoid sequin shoes unless it's the holidays. 3. Opt for a simple hairstyle, like an updo for long hair or a loose style for short hair, without any flashy accessories. 4. Keep makeup minimal with just eyeliner, mascara, and matte lip color. Avoid body glitter or too much sparkle. 5. Pair sequin pants with plain, solid-color jackets, such as a denim, bomber, or faux-leather jacket, or a simple black peacoat for a dressier look. 6.

As a deception intended to cover the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily, two members of British intelligence obtained the body of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison, dressed him as an officer of the Royal Marines and placed personal items on him identifying him as Captain (Acting Major) William Martin. Correspondence between two British generals which suggested that the Allies planned to invade Greece and Sardinia, with Sicily as merely the target of a feint, was also placed on the body. - Glyndwr Michael ( 4 January 1909 -- 24 January 1943 ) was a semi-literate homeless man whose body was used in Operation Mincemeat , the successful World War II deception plan that lured German forces to Greece prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily . The invasion was a success , with Allied losses numbering several thousand fewer than would have been expected had the deception failed . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier.

Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, was a major campaign of World War II, in which the Allies took the island of Sicily from the Axis powers (Italy and Nazi Germany).

Article: Seven tips to good table manners Whether it's a dinner at a friend's house or a business meeting over lunch, we judge people based on their table manners. But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, the perturbation of less governmental protection can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of animal hibernation. Step 1: If there is less governmental protection, there may be a reduction in regulations or enforcement related to habitat protection. This can lead to habitat loss or degradation, which can make it more difficult for animals to find suitable locations for hibernation. Adequate hibernation locations are essential to ensure the safety and success of the hibernation process. Step 2: With less governmental protection, there might be an increase in human activities, such as construction, agriculture, mining, or logging, that can disturb the natural environment. The presence of humans and their activities can create disturbances, stress, and noise that may disrupt the animals' natural cycles and ability to hibernate properly. Step 3: Less governmental protection may also indirectly affect the food supply for animals. This can occur through the destruction of natural habitats or the introduction of invasive species that compete with native animals for food resources. In good weather, when animals need to eat a lot to gain weight, the decrease in food supply can make it more difficult to accumulate enough fat reserves to survive hibernation. Step 4: Additionally, without proper governmental protection, pollution from industrial activities or unsustainable agricultural practices might increase. This can lead to the contamination of water sources and a reduction in air quality, which can affect the overall health of animals and make it harder for them to survive the hibernation period. Step 5: Finally, a reduction in governmental protection for animals can lead to increased threats from predators and poachers, making it more difficult for the animals to find a safe and secure location to hibernate. This can also increase stress levels in animals, which can hinder their ability to enter a proper state of hibernation. In conclusion, the perturbation of less governmental protection can directly and indirectly affect the process of animal hibernation. It can make it more challenging for animals to find appropriate hibernation locations, disrupt the natural cycles required for successful hibernation, decrease the food supply needed to gain weight prior to hibernation and affect the overall health of animals, reducing their ability to survive the hibernation period."},{"question":"Pick your answer from: -Nick did not need that much help. -Derrick did not need that much help.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","response":"The answer to the question \\"Arithmetic and algebra are examples of what science?\\" is found within the provided text, but it does require some analysis to uncover. The text touches upon various philosophical arguments, primarily focusing on Mill's empiricism and its limitations. The part that directly addresses the subject in question is where the text states, \\"Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.\\" From this, we can deduce that arithmetic and algebra are examples of the science of mathematics. Mathematics is a field of study that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. Arithmetic and algebra are two branches within this field. Arithmetic centers around the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as the study of numbers and their properties. Algebra, on the other hand, is an extension of arithmetic that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and variables in formulas and equations, allowing for the exploration of more complex mathematical relationships and problem-solving. The given text delves deeper into the philosophical side of things, critiquing Mill's empiricism for not acknowledging an aspect of reality beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation.\\" However, it is important to note that regardless of the potential shortcomings in Mill's philosophical position, the direct answer to the question is that arithmetic and algebra are examples of mathematics, a field that encompasses a variety of domains and methodologies to explore the intricacies of numbers, patterns, and relationships in the world around us."},{"question":"Sloan: Şiddetin altında yatan ve şiddeti artıran sebepleri ve bunların nasıl ortadan kaldırılabileceğini söyleyemem, fakat terörizm olarak bilinen bu \\"herkese karşı savaş\\"ta şiddeti önlemek açısından istihbarat alışverişinin önemini vurgulamak isterim.

Choose your answer from: a. yes; b. it is not possible to tell; c. no;","response":"c. no Based on the provided premise, it is clear that the individual has not been successful with their compost pile. They have been trying for three years, and the compost still does not decompose as intended. This indicates a lack of success in achieving the desired outcome. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"I have been super successful\\" is true for this situation. There could be several reasons for the compost pile's failure to decompose properly. Here are some possible factors to consider: 1. Poor aeration: For compost to break down effectively, it needs an adequate supply of oxygen. You should turn the pile regularly to mix the materials and introduce air into the compost. Insufficient aeration can slow down the decomposition process. 2. Imbalanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio: A proper balance of carbon-rich materials (like leaves, straw, and paper) and nitrogen-rich materials (like grass clippings, kitchen scraps, and coffee grounds) is essential for efficient decomposition. The ideal ratio is around 30 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen. If your pile consists of too much carbon or not enough nitrogen, it could hinder the decomposition process. 3. Inadequate moisture: Water is an essential factor for the microorganisms and insects that help break down organic matter in a compost pile. Ideally, the contents of the pile should be about as damp as a wrung-out sponge. Both too little and too much moisture can hinder decomposition. 4. Inappropriate size: A compost pile should typically be at least 3 feet wide, 3 feet long, and 3 feet tall to maintain sufficient heat for effective decomposition. A pile that is too small may not be able to generate enough heat, while a pile that is too large may be difficult to aerate. 5. Unfavorable weather conditions: Extreme heat, cold, or drought can slow down the decomposition process by affecting the microorganisms' activity in the compost pile. Try to maintain consistent temperature and moisture levels, and protect the pile from harsh weather conditions. In conclusion, given the premise, we cannot support the hypothesis that the individual has been super successful with their composting endeavor. Instead, they might benefit from investigating the factors contributing to their lack of success and implementing appropriate solutions to improve the composting process."},{"question":"Dylan and Jez are two orphans who meet in their twenties and vow to achieve their shared childhood dream of living in a stately home .

It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 2008 . The song was ranked number 40 on Engine 145 's 50 Best Country Songs of 2007 . - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - The Country Music Association (CMA) was founded in 1958 in Nashville, Tennessee. It originally consisted of only 233 members and was the first trade organization formed to promote a music genre. The objectives of the organization are to guide and enhance the development of Country Music throughout the world; to demonstrate it as a viable medium to advertisers, consumers and media; and to provide a unity of purpose for the Country Music industry. However the CMA may be best known to most country music fans for its annual Country Music Association Awards broadcast live on network television each fall (usually October or November). - The Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance was first awarded in 1965, to Dottie West. The award has had several minor name changes: - The Country Music Association Awards, also known as the CMA Awards or CMAs, are presented to country music artists and broadcasters to recognize outstanding achievement in the country music industry. The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures). - The Academy of Country Music Awards, also known as the ACM Awards, were first held in 1966, honoring the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the first country music awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature \\"hat\\" trophy was created in 1968. The awards were first televised in 1972 on ABC. In 1979, the Academy joined with Dick Clark Productions to produce the show. Dick Clark and Al Schwartz served as producers while Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to NBC and finally to CBS, where it remains today. - Dottie West (born Dorothy Marie Marsh; October 11, 1932 September 4, 1991) was an American country music singer and songwriter. Along with her friends and fellow recording artists Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, she is considered one of the genre's most influential and groundbreaking female artists. Dottie West's career started in the 1960s, with her Top 10 hit, \\"Here Comes My Baby Back Again\\", which won her the first Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1965. - The Academy of Country Music (ACM) was founded in 1964 in Los Angeles, California as the Country & Western Music Academy. Among those involved in the founding was Eddie Miller and Tommy Wiggins, who joined Mickey Christensen and Chris Christensen. They wanted to promote country music in the western 13 states with the support of artist based on the West Coast. Artist such as Johnny Bond, Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard, Roger Miller, and many more influenced them. The ball finally started rolling in 1965 when a board of directors was formed to govern the Academy. - Miranda Leigh Lambert (born November 10, 1983) is an American country music singer and songwriter.

Does the word \\"play\\" mean the same thing in \\"Play sports.\\" and \\"Play cards.\\"? Available options: 1). different meanings. 2). the same meaning.","response":"The word \\"play\\" in the phrases \\"Play sports\\" and \\"Play cards\\" does not have the exact same meaning, but they share a common base that refers to the act of engaging in a recreational or leisurely activity. In each context, the word \\"play\\" carries a slightly different connotation. To better understand the differences and similarities, let's examine both phrases more closely. 1) Different meanings: \\"Play sports\\" refers to engaging in physical activities, often competitive in nature, that require skill, strength, and coordination. When you play sports, you are generally partaking in an athletic activity that involves one or more people working together to achieve a common goal, such as running, swimming, or competing in team sports like basketball, soccer, or rugby. The nature of the activity in playing sports focuses on physical exertion, teamwork, and, in many cases, competition. The concept of \\"playing\\" within the context of sports emphasizes the recreational and leisurely aspect of the activity despite its physical demands. On the other hand, \\"Play cards\\" refers to engaging in a card game, which is a more sedentary activity that revolves around playing with a standard deck of cards, or a specialized deck depending on the game. Card games are played by people of all ages and can range from competitive to recreational in their nature. Examples include poker, bridge, or solitaire. When you \\"play cards,\\" you are using critical thinking, strategy, and sometimes luck or probability to outwit your opponents or achieve a specific outcome. The word \\"play\\" in this context highlights the leisurely aspect of the mental exercise as well as the social interaction that typically accompanies card games. 2) The same meaning: While the word \\"play\\" within the two phrases has varying meanings tied to the specific activities mentioned, there is a common underlying meaning. In both cases, the concept of engaging in a pastime or recreational activity brings an element of fun, leisure, enjoyment, and often socialization. The word \\"play\\" is used to describe both physical sports and mental games to signify that they are non-work-related activities meant to be enjoyed and participated in for relaxation, amusement, or personal growth. In conclusion, the word \\"play\\" carries different meanings in the phrases \\"Play sports\\" and \\"Play cards.\\" However, the shared meaning of engaging in a leisurely, recreational activity connects both phrases. So, it could be argued that the word \\"play\\" has distinct connotations in these contexts, but the underlying concept remains the same."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Therefore, taking the context into account, Carson would most likely want to ensure everything was correct (Option ii) before moving onto the next weld. After spot checking the weld, Carson would want to analyze and verify all associated measurements, materials, and equipment related to the weld. This process will involve inspecting the dimensions of the welded components, ensuring that they adhere to the project's specifications. Additionally, this step may include reevaluating the welding technique, filler material, travel speed, and other key factors that could impact the integrity of the weld. Moreover, Carson should examine welding equipment such as electrode holders, cables, and other protective gear to confirm their proper functionality and condition. This is to make sure that there are no faults or weaknesses in the welding process that might compromise the overall quality of the next weld. Accurately assessing all these factors will enable Carson to identify any errors or inconsistencies in the welding process and make the necessary adjustments accordingly. It is important to perform this step before taking a lunch break or continuing with the subsequent welds to maintain optimal work quality and eliminate the need for any rework. Once Carson has thoroughly checked everything and is confident that all aspects of the welding process are precise and accurate, they can confidently move on to the next weld. Depending on the project timeline and Carson's personal schedule, a lunch break (Option iii) may be suitable at this point. If there is still ample time, Carson can continue working until a convenient break time. Regardless, ensuring that everything is correct (Option ii) is the ideal next step for Carson in this circumstance."},{"question":"Q:Build a movie plot around this: Which gargoyles rescue the monster? Their names are Ophir and Keziah A:","response":"Title: Guardians of the Lost Monster Step 1: Introduce the main characters We begin by introducing our protagonists, Ophir and Keziah, two gargoyles who have been living on the rooftop of an ancient cathedral in a medieval town. The two have been eternally guarding the building and the people of the town for centuries from any harm that may come their way. They come to life only at night, when their true personalities are revealed - Ophir is a wise, calm guardian, while Keziah is brave and fiery. Their bond as companions is unbreakable. Step 2: Introduce conflict One day, the townfolk are terrorized by a mysterious monster that starts attacking their homes and livestock in the middle of the night. Due to their fear, the people begin to abandon their town, suspecting that the monster is cursed and getting more violent by the day. Step 3: Propose a goal for the protagonists Ophir and Keziah, upon hearing the stories of the monster, feel responsible for the town's safety and decide that their purpose is to rescue the monster and stop the terror. They believe that the monster might be misunderstood and requires their help to set things right. They set off on an epic quest to find and secure the monster. Step 4: Introduce a subplot and side characters Throughout their journey, Ophir and Keziah encounter various mythical creatures and allies who join their cause. One of these is a wise old Kraken from a distant sea, who informs the gargoyles of a prophecy that speaks of two guardians saving a cursed creature that brings disaster. This revelation only strengthens Ophir and Keziah's resolve. Step 5: Escalate the stakes and obstacle As Ophir and Keziah close in on the monster's lair, an evil sorcerer named Malphas learns of their quest and intercedes, revealing that he has been controlling the monster to seek revenge on the town. Malphas will stop at nothing to maintain his control over the monster, and thus the gargoyles must battle him to save both the monster and their beloved town. Step 6: Reach the climax In an impressive climactic battle, Malphas proves to be a formidable foe, using his dark magic to counter Ophir's wisdom and Keziah's bravery. By combining their unique strengths and working together, the gargoyle duo eventually break Malphas's dark spell, restoring the monster to its true gentle nature. Step 7: Resolve the story The grateful and redeemed monster, along with other creatures whom the gargoyles have met during their quest, return to the town. The people, sensing the monster is no longer a threat, welcome them with open arms. Ophir and Keziah are hailed as heroes and solidify their roles as the town's guardians. Step 8: End the movie We end with a heartwarming scene of Ophir and Keziah perched proudly on the cathedral rooftop once more, watching over the now-harmonious coexistence between humans and magical creatures in their town. The prophecy is fulfilled, and our guardians can rest and prepare for any future adventures that destiny has in store for them."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled The answer to this question is:","response":"The final step in the process of respiration, as described above, involves the transportation of the exhaled carbon dioxide out of the body and the monitoring of the entire breathing cycle by the respiratory centers in the brain: 1. Transportation of Exhaled Carbon Dioxide: Once the diaphragm moves back up and the lungs have expelled air containing carbon dioxide, the stale air is carried out of the body through the same pathway it came in, but in reverse order. Carbon dioxide travels from the bronchioles into the bronchi, which then merge into the trachea. It continues moving upward until it reaches the larynx and, finally, passes out of the body through the nose or mouth. 2. Monitoring and Control of the Breathing Cycle: The entire respiratory process is monitored and controlled by specific areas within your brainstem; collectively, these areas are known as the respiratory centers. These centers work together to regulate the rate, depth, and timing of your breaths. They receive various types of information about the body's internal environment, such as levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood, blood pH, and the extent to which the lungs are stretched. The respiratory centers analyze this information and then adjust your breathing accordingly. When carbon dioxide levels in the blood are higher than normal, the respiratory centers send signals to stimulate the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles to contract, effectively initiating an inhalation. By excreting more carbon dioxide and replenishing the oxygen supply, the body restores balance to its internal conditions. Thus, the final step in this breathing process is the removal of carbon dioxide from the body, followed by the ongoing monitoring and adjustment of respiratory activities by the respiratory centers in your brainstem. This regulatory mechanism ensures that the body maintains an appropriate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide at all times, which is crucial for proper physiological functioning."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

Luke Rowan, when he left the cottage, walked quickly back across the green towards Baslehurst. He had sauntered out slowly on his road from the brewery to Bragg's End, being in doubt as to what he would do when he reached his destination; but there was no longer room for doubt now; he had said that to Rachel's mother which made any further doubt impossible, and he was resolved that he would ask Rachel to be his wife. He had spoken to Mrs. Ray of his intention in that respect as though he thought that such an offer on his part might probably be rejected, and in so speaking had at the time spoken the truth; but he was eager, sanguine, and self-confident by nature, and though he was by no means disposed to regard himself as a conquering hero by whom any young lady would only be too happy to find herself beloved, he did not at the present moment look forward to his future fate with despair. He walked quickly home along the dusty road, picturing to himself a happy prosperous future in Baslehurst, with Rachel as his wife, and the Tappitts living in some neighbouring villa on an income paid to old Tappitt by him out of the proceeds of the brewery. That was his present solution of the brewery difficulty. Tappitt was growing old, and it might be quite as well not only for himself, but for the cause of humanity in Devonshire, that he should pass the remainder of his life in that dignity which comfortable retirement from business affords.

If so,that's a good thing.There are many benefits to reading.Getting into a good novel improves our literacy .But who or what encourages us to pick up a book and start reading? Of course,when we are young,our parents and teachers inspire us by introducing us to characters that we love--or love to hate.And there are the authors--the people who invent and write about these characters.Good writing can really catch our imagination. One modern-day children's author is J.K.Rowling,who's known for her books about the wizard,Harry Potter.Last year she was named as a'literacy hero'for her part in improving people's love of reading.The UK's National Literacy Trust awarded her the title for\\"turning a generation of children into readers.\\" The Trust also honoured schoolchildren,a librarian and teachers for their effort in trying to get people to read.The actor, Henry Winkler, who has dyslexia ,was also named for the books he has written about a boy with learning difficulties. Reading books is more than an enjoyable pastime;it can also help people in difficult circumstances.The author Pat Winslow worked as a writer in prisons and found reading and discussing stories helped prisoners reflect on their patterns of behaviour.She says\\"Very often we would have discussions about the moral compass of a character, what was the motivation of somebody, why did they behave that way?\\" Today I like to read factual books such as biographies,where you get an insight into the lives of important and well-known people.I also enjoy looking at travel books and learning about journeys and new destinations.It's a good substitute if you can't visit in person.

The morning loop consists of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis, as well as PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators.) The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, both involved in regulation of flowering time genes. When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed (under constant light or dark conditions), plants become arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop. Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning, whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals. Question: What produces a self-sustaining rhythm?","response":"The central oscillator produces a self-sustaining rhythm in the context of the plant's circadian clock system. This oscillator is driven by two interacting feedback loops that are active at different times of the day, maintaining a 24-hour cycle and regulating various physiological and biochemical processes within the plant. These feedback loops consist of multiple genes and their corresponding proteins, which interact with each other in a complex network to maintain and control the rhythm. The morning loop is composed of CCA1 (Circadian and Clock-Associated 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl), which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis plants. Additionally, this loop includes PRR 7 and 9 (Pseudo-Response Regulators) that contribute to regulating the clock system. The evening loop consists of GI (Gigantea) and ELF4, which are involved in the regulation of flowering time genes. Oscillations and peak expressions of these genes help in maintaining the self-sustaining rhythm throughout the day. For example, the gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks during the early morning, whereas TOC1 (Timing of CAB Expression 1) gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening. A critical aspect of the self-sustaining rhythm is the negative feedback loop created by the interactions between these genes. Overexpression of CCA1 and LHY leads to the plants becoming arrhythmic, and mRNA signals reduce, contributing to a negative feedback loop that stabilizes the rhythm. In 2012, the findings by Andrew Millar and others revealed that TOC1 acts as a repressor of not only CCA1, LHY, PRR7, and PRR9 in the morning loop but also GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. This discovery and subsequent computational modeling of TOC1's gene functions and interactions led to a reframing of the plant circadian clock model as a triple negative-component repressilator, distinguishing it from the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals. In summary, the central oscillator produces a self-sustaining rhythm through the complex interactions between two feedback loops, various genes, and their corresponding proteins. These precise interactions and their regulatory mechanisms help maintain the plant's circadian clock and facilitate essential biological processes over a 24-hour cycle."},{"question":"Article:He said it was a \\"bizarre and cruel thing\\" for the princes to do and the funeral procession was \\"the most horrifying half an hour of my life\\".

A: not think ahead B: ask Taylor to be very still C: be careless with her work","response":"B: ask Taylor to be very still. According to the given context, Cameron has become Taylor's artist, and she is commissioned to create a portrait of Taylor. Therefore, as an artist working on a portrait, it is likely that Cameron would ask Taylor to be very still during the creation process. The reason for this is that ensuring Taylor remains still will help Cameron to capture her likeness more accurately. Regardless of the medium chosen for creating the portrait (such as painting or drawing), an artist typically needs their subject to maintain a consistent position and expression during the process. Answer A (\\"not think ahead\\") does not seem fitting in this context, as it suggests that Cameron could be disorganized or not focused on her work, which is not implied in the provided context. Similarly, answer C (\\"be careless with her work\\") is not an appropriate response, as it implies a negative behavior that is not supported by the context.

New state regulations had forced several of Dallas’s six abortion clinics to close, creating weekslong waiting lists. By the time the woman could get in, she would be up against the Texas ban on abortions after 20 weeks’ gestation. But she could not afford the trip to New Mexico. So it was that she had left a phone message with a hotline in Austin and, on a recent evening, heard back from Lenzi Sheible, the 20-year-old founder of a fund to help low-income women pay the unexpected costs of traveling for abortions in Texas — or to states beyond. They spoke four times that night as the woman wavered about going to Albuquerque alone. “You can always call me when you get to New Mexico; just talk to me,” Ms. Sheible said. By the end of the evening, she had texted the woman confirmation numbers for a flight the next day, 680 round trip, and four nights’ stay at an Albuquerque hotel, with shuttle service to the clinic. Like an entrepreneur meeting a new market demand, Ms. Sheible, among others, has stepped up as women are finding it increasingly difficult to get abortions across large areas of the United States. In just over three years, according to the Guttmacher Institute, states have passed 231 laws restricting abortion, more than any time in the four decades since the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Although longtime groups like Planned Parenthood remain active, and other organizations subsidize poor women’s costs for abortion procedures, Ms. Sheible is filling what she calls a new need in Texas for help with lodging and transportation — bus or plane tickets, gas money, taxi fare. “The entire western half of Texas is an abortion clinic desert,” Ms. Sheible wrote on the website of the nonprofit organization, Fund Texas Choice, that she started 15 months ago. To Kimberly I. McGuire, a director at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, groups like Ms. Sheible’s are crucial. “It’s a reaction to a sense of desperation across the country as more clinics close, as more communities are left without providers,” especially communities of low-income minority and rural women, she said. Ms. Sheible, now pregnant with her second child, quickly drew the attention of the anti-abortion movement in the state. Texas Right to Life published an article in April that compared her fund “to trains that brought Jews to Auschwitz.” She occasionally gets voice mail messages like one last month: “You’re really not about helping women; you’re about killing children.” Her own past is as rough as that of any of the women she helps. Born to a troubled woman who gave her up at age 7 to married friends — Ms. Sheible does not know her biological father — she spent a month of her senior year in a drug rehabilitation center. But she graduated as valedictorian, with enough academic credits to get through the University of Texas in two years. She now attends its law school. “Lenzi is one of the most brilliant kids I’ve ever taught,” said Erik Ostergren, her dean at Westside High School. “We’d always say, ‘Lenzi could go in one of two directions: She could do something amazing and be fantastic, or really go off the rails.’ ” In summer 2013, Ms. Sheible, then pregnant with her first child, Cora, started her fund immediately after Texas enacted some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the nation. The laws, both in Texas and in other Republican-dominated states, commonly impose at least a 24-hour wait between a woman’s first clinic visit and an abortion, forcing many out-of-towners to book hotels. They require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and mandate that clinics meet the same costly equipment, building and staffing standards as an ambulatory surgical center. Clinics that cannot comply must close. Supporters say the laws protect women’s health in case of emergencies. Abortion-rights advocates counter that the regulations are not only unnecessary, given the safety record of abortions and the availability of emergency room care, but also unconstitutional because of a Supreme Court ruling against “undue burdens” on women seeking abortions. More such laws are expected, however, now that Republicans expanded their control of state and federal offices in this month’s elections. The next Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, wants to make a ban on abortions after 20 weeks the law of the land. Given legal challenges to the laws in states including Alabama, Mississippi, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin, both sides say the Supreme Court will have to settle the matter. In the meantime, numerous clinics have closed from Arizona to North Carolina, with more closings likely. Ohio is down to eight clinics from 14, and three more are in jeopardy. Only temporary court orders have kept open the last clinic in Toledo, as well as in Mississippi. But in few places have the changes and effects been as drastic as in sprawling Texas. From 42 abortion clinics in 13 cities in May 2013, the state now has about 20 clinics and soon may be down to eight providers in four metropolitan areas — Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, according to Naral Pro-Choice Texas — assuming, as many do, that advocates lose their appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Pending the outcome, the Supreme Court last month stayed the surgery-center standards and also allowed clinics in El Paso and McAllen, distant points on the Rio Grande border, to operate without admitting privileges. Ms. Sheible’s fund now has a seven-member board that includes her husband, Warren Sheible. In January, the group will have its first paid staff member. In just over a year, she said, the fund received about 60,000, mostly in small amounts, and has spent about 25,000 to help 106 women statewide. Ms. Sheible estimated that roughly a quarter of the women she helps do not make the trips, usually because the women change their minds or cannot arrange child care or a ride to a bus station or airport. Ms. Sheible quickly learned to buy only refundable tickets. (The pregnant woman from Dallas did fly to Albuquerque, Ms. Sheible said, but after a 12-hour delay because of a canceled flight, which forced the clinic to reschedule her appointment to the next day.) Over an evening in her sparsely furnished apartment, where she sipped soda to ease nausea from her pregnancy, Ms. Sheible expressed some surprise that running a nonprofit group has turned her from a self-described wild child into someone “super-conventional.” But four tattoos and a fifth that is not visible still suggest otherwise. Down one arm is the Transco Tower in Houston, a symbol of the city where Ms. Sheible was born. On her left arm is the University of Texas Tower. The hidden tattoo, inside her lower lip, says “babygirl” — a nickname from a family that took her in during her senior year in high school, after her adoptive parents kicked her out and before she went into rehab. Her adoptive father paid for her treatment. Heather Busby, executive director of Naral Pro-Choice Texas, said that when she speaks before audiences of older abortion rights advocates — “the pre-Roe generation,” she calls them — “They ask, ‘Where are the younger people? Why aren’t they getting involved?’ ” With women like Ms. Sheible in mind, she said she tells them, “Look at the abortion funds. That’s where they are.” A version of this article appears in print on November 28, 2014, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Activists Help Pay for Patients’ Travel to Shrinking Number of Abortion Clinics.

Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether or not \\"get her oils on Kendall's face\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Jan do this?\\" However, this scenario can be analyzed from multiple perspectives to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons behind Jan's action. Firstly, it is essential to consider the context in which the scene unfolded, as this can greatly influence the interpretation of the characters' actions. If Jan and Kendall are in a romantic relationship, Jan's action might be interpreted as an expression of intimacy or affection. In such a case, it would be unlikely that her primary objective would be to \\"get her oils on Kendall's face.\\" On the other hand, if Jan and Kendall are friends or relatives, Jan's action could be seen as a gesture of comfort or support. In scenarios where Kendall is not feeling well, for example, Jan might try to soothe or console her friend by resting her head against her forehead. Once again, the primary motivation behind Jan's action would likely not be the transference of her oils. In the absence of any indication that Jan is attempting to perform a specific task or ritual that involves getting her oils on Kendall's face, it is unlikely that this is the main reason behind her action, especially given the context of the characters being on the bed. While it is physically possible that some amount of oil from Jan's face could have transferred onto Kendall's face, it is improbable that this was her primary goal. Instead, more plausible explanations for her action might include showing affection, providing comfort, or checking for fever, among other possibilities. In conclusion, based on the given information and the various factors that were analyzed, the answer \\"get her oils on Kendall's face\\" is not a valid answer because it disregards the emotional or psychological reasons behind Jan's action. Thus, it is essential to examine the context and the relationship between the characters to comprehend the true motivation behind Jan's actions in this scenario."},{"question":"What we have done with Pluto is put a new staff-facing front end, but the assessments and calculations are still done in Cuba,” McHardie added.

Article: Mr. Knight was the manager of a hotel. One weekend all of the hotels in the city were full because there was a large meeting. On Friday, three men came into the hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Knight said there were no rooms ready because of the meeting. The men were unhappy. Mr. Knight wanted to help them. He remembered that Room 418, a small room, was empty. He asked them if they could share a room. The three men said they would. Mr. Knight said the room would be thirty dollars; ten dollars for each person. Each man gave him the money and then went up to the room. Mr. Knight soon began to feel sorry. \\"Thirty dollars is a lot to ask as a price for that small room.\\" he thought. He called his assistant over and said, \\"Here is five dollars. Take it to the men in Room 418. I asked too much for their room.\\" The assistant took the money. While he was on the way there, he started to think, \\"How can three men divide five dollars? I'll give them each only one dollar and keep the two dollars for myself. The men will be happy to get something back. And Mr. Knight will never know.\\" So the assistant returned one dollar to each man. Each man had at first paid ten dollars. After the assistant returned them one dollar each, each had actually(in fact) paid nine. There were three men. 9 3=\\"27.\\" The assistant kept2. 27+2=\\"29.\\" Where is the missing dollar? Question: At first _ . Options: A: 27 was paid by the three men B: 30 was paid by each of the three men C: 25 was paid by the three men D: 10 was paid by each of the three men A:","response":"The correct answer is D: 10 was paid by each of the three men. This conclusion is directly drawn from the scenario presented in the text. It clearly states that Mr. Knight, the hotel manager, asked for ten dollars from each man for the room. Following this, \\"Each man gave him the money\\", further reinforcing that ten dollars was indeed paid by each of the three men. The total amount Mr. Knight received initially was thirty dollars (10 x 3 = 30). This action occurred before the assistant decided to return a dollar to each man and kept two for himself, which subsequently resulted in the men having paid nine dollars each in actuality. Hence, the initial amount paid by each of the three men was ten dollars, providing the accurate answer for the question in contention. Option B: 30 was paid by each of the three men is incorrect because it wrongly triples the individual contribution. Each person only paid 10, not 30. The total amount paid was 30, but it was split among the three men. Option A: 27 was paid by the three men is incorrect too, as it refers to the amount paid by the men collectively after they were returned a dollar by the assistant and does not regard the initial amount paid by each man. Option C: 25 was paid by the three men is also incorrect because it does not reflect any transaction reflected in the text.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"Step 1: Analyze the given sentences Sentence 1 states that \\"He told Daniel that he and I wanted to be alone, to discuss leaderly things.\\" This sentence tells us that Daniel has been informed that the two people (he and I) wanted to speak privately about certain topics. Sentence 2 states that \\"Daniel was not happy that we wanted to be alone.\\" This sentence tells us about Daniel's emotional response to their desire for a private conversation. Step 2: Determine entailment Entailment is the logical consequence between two statements, meaning that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between the sentences In our case, the first sentence provides information about the desire for a private conversation and that Daniel has been informed about it, but it doesn't explicitly mention Daniel's emotional response. The second sentence addresses Daniel's reaction to the news. Step 4: Make a conclusion Since the first sentence doesn't provide sufficient information about Daniel's emotional response, we cannot conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence.

Context: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis promised Thursday the Pentagon will \\"notify\\" Congress before any possible military action in Syria, where the U.S. is considering responding to a suspected chemical weapons attack. \\"There will be notification to leadership, of course, prior to the attack,\\" Mattis said in his testimony at the House Armed Services Committee. \\"We will report to Congress. We will keep open lines of communication.\\" But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq. The overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions.

Answer:","response":"The last step of the process is allowing the fermentation to take place. During fermentation, the yeast consumes the sugar present in the grapes, converting it into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process typically takes several days to a few weeks, depending on various factors like temperature, yeast strain, and sugar content. Once fermentation is complete, the resulting product, known as wine or grape juice (depending on the fermentation duration and conditions), is separated from the solid grape remnants and can be further aged, clarified, or bottled for consumption."},{"question":"Process: - Dirty dishes are rinsed - Placed into the dishwasher - A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser - The dishwasher is closed - The power is turned on - In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the dishes were not cleaned happens, how will it affect the dishes are already clean. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"In the given process, dirty dishes are rinsed, placed into the dishwasher, and detergent is added to the detergent dispenser. The dishwasher is closed, the power is turned on, and in about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean. Step 1: Dirty dishes are rinsed Justification: Rinsing the dishes before placing them in the dishwasher helps remove food particles and grease that might otherwise stick on them during the wash cycle. Step 2: Placed into the dishwasher Justification: Placing rinsed dishes into the dishwasher ensures they are properly exposed to the water and detergent during the wash cycle, resulting in cleaner dishes. Step 3: A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser Justification: The detergent breaks down food residues and grease, allowing the dishwasher to effectively clean the dishes during the wash cycle. Step 4: The dishwasher is closed Justification: Closing the dishwasher prevents water and detergent from escaping during the wash cycle, ensuring the dishes are cleaned properly. Step 5: The power is turned on Justification: Turning on the power activates the dishwasher's wash cycle, allowing it to clean the dishes using water, detergent, and jets. Step 6: In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean Justification: The typical dishwasher wash cycle takes around 1.5 to 2 hours to complete, during which time the dishes are effectively cleaned. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose the dishes were not cleaned In case the dishes were not cleaned, there could be several reasons, including: incorrect dishwasher settings, insufficient detergent, or a malfunctioning dishwasher component. Effects of the Perturbation on the Process: 1. Direct effect - Dishes remain dirty, and the process has not achieved the desired outcome. This may result in the need for additional manual washing or re-running the dishwasher with corrected settings or repairs. 2. Indirect effect - The cleanliness of future loads may be affected if the underlying issue is not addressed. This could lead to an accumulation of dirty dishes, and more time and resources might be required to address the situation. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the dishes not being cleaned has both direct and indirect effects on the process. The primary effect is the unsatisfactory result of having dirty dishes after the completion of the dishwasher cycle. The indirect effects include potential impacts on the cleanliness of future loads and the need to diagnose and address the underlying problem to prevent further issues."},{"question":"Instructions: Given a sentence in Russian, generate a new Russian sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...","response":"The full names of the two commanding officers who were involved with the surprise capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 are Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Ethan Allen was the leader of the Green Mountain Boys, a militia organization that was initially formed to defend the property rights of local residents in the area where Vermont is now located. Allen was an influential figure in the early American Revolution and played a crucial role in capturing Fort Ticonderoga. Benedict Arnold was a military officer who served the American Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He rose to the rank of general and is best known for his later defection to the British Army. In the early stage of the war, Arnold joined forces with Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys to capture Fort Ticonderoga. Together, Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold led a surprise attack on Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. During this attack, they successfully captured the strategic fort from the British with minimal resistance, giving the American forces a significant advantage. Cannons that were taken from the fort were later used to help lift the siege of Boston, eventually leading to the British evacuation."},{"question":"Egypt's Mubarak in critical condition What is a sentence that would be (on a scale from 0 to 5) a 6. out of 5 in terms of textual similarity to the above sentence?","response":"Egyptian leader Mubarak faces severe critical health situation."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a text which is the body of a document and a title which is the title of the document.

Masami Akita (Qiu Tian Chang Mei , Akita Masami, born December 19, 1956), better known by his stage name Merzbow (merutsubau, Merutsubau), is a Japanese noise musician. He is best known for his style of harsh, confrontational noise exemplified on his 1996 release, Pulse Demon. Since 1980, he has released over 400 recordings, and has collaborated with various artists. During the European tour in September-October 1989, Merzbow could only bring simple and portable gear; this led to the harsh noise style Merzbow became known for in the 1990s. Cloud Cock OO Grand (1990) was the first example of this new style, Merzbow's first digital recording (on DAT), and the first recording made for the CD format. It also includes live material recorded during the tour. But when I started live in late 1980s I didn't like to use tape on stage. I like only live electronics. So, my studio works changed to more live composition style. I'm still using many tapes in studio works, but difference is I treat tapes and instruments. Before, I used tapes as overdubbing concept. But now tapes are crashing together, no static overdub. I found that style on Cloud Cock OO Grand. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Merzbow began to be influenced by death metal and grindcore. Recordings from this time are mostly recorded at extreme volume, some mastered at levels far beyond standard (Noisembryo, Pulse Demon). In 1994, Akita acquired a vintage EMS synthesizer. From 1996, plans were made to release a \\"10 (or maybe 12)\\" CD box set on Extreme Records. In 2000, Extreme Records released the Merzbox, a fifty CD set of Merzbow records, twenty of them not previously released. Throughout most of the 1990s, Merzbow live was a trio with Reiko A. on electronics and Bara on voice and dance. Masami Akita occasionally played drums for Hijokaidan during the early-mid 1990s. In the early 1990s, Masami Akita composed the soundtracks to numerous kinbaku videos by Fuji Planning (Bu Er Qi Hua , Fuji Kikaku) and seppuku-themed videos by their sub-label Right Brain. Akita also directed Lost Paradise (Shi Le Yuan Cheng Ma Fu Nu Fu Qie ri, Shitsurakuen: Jobafuku onna harakiri) for Right Brain. Some of this music was included on Music for Bondage Performance and Music for Bondage Performance 2, co-credited to Right Brain Audile. Director Ian Kerkhof would use a Merzbow track for his 1992 film La sequence des barres paralleles, and Akita composed original music for Kerhof's 1994 film The Dead Man 2: Return of the Dead Man. Kerkhof made the documentary Beyond Ultra Violence: Uneasy Listening by Merzbow in 1998. Akita also created music for Ilppo Pohjola's Asphalto (1998) and Routemaster (2000). Since 1999, Akita has used computers in his recordings, having first acquired a Macintosh to work on art for the Merzbox. Also at this time he began referring to his home studio as \\"Bedroom, Tokyo\\". At live performances, Akita has produced noise music from either two laptop computers or combination of a laptop and analog synthesizers/guitar pedals. Reiko A. and Bara left Merzbow during this time, Reiko Azuma now has a solo career. Since 2001, Jenny Akita (nee Kawabata) started being credited for artwork on various releases. Since 2001, Akita started utilising samples of animal sounds in various releases starting with Frog. Around 2002, Akita became a vegan, he stated how it began: I started raising four bantams, the little ornamental chickens. With this experience as a start, I gradually started to be concerned and care about chickens and all the barn animals I used to eat without giving it a second thought before. So I started reading books and researching on the internet about Animal Rights and that triggered an awareness of \\"evil\\" that human society has done. During this period, Akita also became a supporter of PETA which is reflected in his animal-themed releases. An example of this is Minazo Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, dedicated to an elephant seal he visited often at the zoo and Bloody Sea, a protest against Japanese whaling. He has also produced several works centered around recordings of his pet chickens (notably Animal Magnetism and Turmeric). Also in 2002, Akita released Merzbeat, which was seen as a significant departure from his trademark abstract style in that it contains beat-oriented pieces. This has sparked some controversy among fans, though some reviewers pointed out that it sounded very similar to Aqua Necromancer (1998) which features samples of progressive rock drumming. Merzbird (2004) and Merzbuddha (2005) followed in a similar vein with sampled beats combined with Merzbow's signature harsh noise. Starting in the mid-2000s, Masami Akita began to reintroduce junk metal and effects pedals back into his setup. By the early-2010s, he was using a large number of pedals, oscillators and tone generators, and reduced to a single laptop running granular synthesis software. In 2014, he toured without a laptop. In 2008, Akita reintroduced the drum kit, his first instrument. This can be heard on the 13 Japanese Birds series. At this time he changed the name of his home studio to Munemihouse. Beginning in November 2009, Merzbow started releasing archival material from the 1980s and 1990s, both reissues and previously unreleased material, several of which were released on cassette. The Blossoming Noise label reissued the 1980s cassettes E-Study, Collection 004, Collection 005, Normal Music, and Flesh Metal Orgasm. The Kibbutz cassette was reissued on vinyl by Urashima. Other cassettes of unreleased material include Untitled Nov 1989, 9888A, April 1992, and Variations for Electric Fan. 2010-2013 saw the release several archival box sets; Merzbient, Merzphysics, Merzmorphosis, Lowest Music & Arts 1980-1983, and Duo. Akita began collaborating with the Hungarian drummer Balazs Pandi in 2009, initially Pandi served as a live drummer for Merzbow. This resulted in the live albums Live at Fluc Wanne, Vienna 2010/05/18, Ducks: Live in NYC, and Katowice. Akita and Pandi then began to record studio albums collaborating with additional musicians, Cuts (2013) with the Swedish saxophone player Mats Gustafsson, Cuts of Guilt, Cuts Deeper (2015) with Gustafsson and Thurston Moore, and An Untroublesome Defencelessness with Keiji Haino (2016), all released by RareNoiseRecords. Akita, Pandi, and Gustafsson also toured together and released the live LP Live in Tabacka 13/04/12. Merzbow also released several collaborations with industrial/noise musicians he had know since the 1980s: Spiral Right / Spiral Left with Z'EV, The Black Album with John Duncan, and a trio of releases with Maurizio Bianchi, Amniocentesi / Envoise 30 05 82 (a split with two tracks from 1982), Merzbow Meets M.B., and Amalgamelody. Gensho, the seventh collaborative releases with Boris, was released in 2016. It is a double album, one disc is by Boris and one by Merzbow, that are meant to be played at the same time.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Which place would have thinner \\"A horizon\\", Kenya or Tanzania? A:","response":"Based on the information provided, Tanzania would have a thinner A horizon compared to Kenya.

Translate to English","response":"Industrial emissions produced by us are the ones that have directly led to the drastic alteration of the climate in the region, and now we are threatening to impose our values and traditions on the people of the Arctic area, at this very sensitive moment. Industrial emissions generated by our modern societies have been one of the main factors contributing significantly to the drastic change in the Earth's climate, especially due to the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. The combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various other anthropogenic activities have led to higher levels of these gases in the atmosphere, trapping more heat and resulting in global warming. The Arctic region, which encompasses the northernmost parts of the Earth, including the Arctic Ocean, is highly susceptible to climate change. The increasing global temperature has caused the polar ice caps to melt at an alarming rate, directly impacting the Arctic's unique and fragile ecosystems, wildlife, and indigenous communities. The traditional way of life, which has been followed by the native people of the Arctic for generations, is now at risk due to the changing climate and the gradual disappearance of their natural environment. As modern societies continue to expand, interact, and integrate globally, there is an increasing tendency to impose dominant values, traditions, and lifestyles on other cultures. This imposition might lead to the loss of the unique heritage and identity of the indigenous Arctic people, who are already facing the challenges posed by climate change. Their rich history, cultural practices, and intimate connection with nature are being threatened by the encroachment of modernity and the potential exploitation of the Arctic's bountiful resources, in parallel with the exacerbating effects of climate change. At this very sensitive moment, it is crucial to recognize and respect the autonomy, rights, and wisdom of the Arctic communities. Providing support and assistance for them to adapt to the changing climate conditions while preserving their cultural values and practices would be a more empathetic and responsible approach.

Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present, while Sabrina had a low concentration present in her mixture. Which person's mixture, Alexiev's or Sabrina's, has a higher pH value at the end? Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7.

The answer is:","response":"The last step of the process is a volcanic eruption. As the pressure from the gases and molten magma builds up beneath the Earth's surface, it eventually reaches a critical point where the pressure becomes too much for the surrounding rock to contain. At this point, the magma and gases are forced out through fractures or vents in the Earth's crust, leading to a volcanic eruption. The magma that reaches the surface is called lava, and as this lava cools and solidifies, it forms new rocks and landforms, such as volcanic cones or islands.

The answer to this question is:","response":"To understand the potential effects of reducing human intervention on the butterfly life cycle, let's analyze the process step-by-step and consider the possible consequences. 1. Egg: If human intervention is lowered, it could result in a more natural environment for butterflies to lay their eggs. As a result, there might be an increase in the number of eggs laid on suitable plants, potentially leading to the birth of more butterflies. 2. Hatching: With less human intervention, there may be fewer disruptions to the hatching process, hence increasing the number of eggs that successfully hatch into caterpillars. 3. Feeding: Reduced human intervention could also mean less pollution or destruction of the plants that caterpillars feed on, resulting in a larger and more diverse food source for caterpillars to grow and thrive. 4. Growth: Caterpillars may experience better growth with less human intervention, as there might be less exposure to pollution and pesticides that can adversely affect their development. 5. Pupa formation: In a relatively undisturbed environment, caterpillars are more likely to find safe and suitable locations for pupation, which could result in a higher survival rate during this phase. 6. Metamorphosis: With less exposure to harmful chemicals and pollutants, the metamorphosis process might be more successful, leading to a higher number of healthy butterflies. 7. Wing development: Reduced human intervention could result in healthier butterflies with stronger wings, allowing them to fly more efficiently and be more successful in mating and reproducing. 8. Flight: Finally, with healthier, stronger butterflies, they may be more likely to successfully fly away and complete their life cycle, potentially leading to more butterflies. In conclusion, by reducing human intervention, it is possible that there would be a direct or indirect positive effect on the butterfly life cycle, ultimately resulting in more butterflies. This could be due to better protection and preservation of their natural habitat, less exposure to pollution and pesticides, and an overall healthier environment for them to thrive in."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sentence in Somali language, translate the sentence to English language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

That exact scenario happened to one hapless candidate in London this week. The man was travelling on the London Underground Monday when a fellow passenger blocked his way. He responded in the traditional London manner, with a push, a shove and some of the expletive-laden compliments so familiar with dwellers in the capital. Perhaps he was stressed; he had an interview lined up for the role of Python Developer at Forward Partners for later that day. What he didn't realise was that his victim was Matt Buckland, Head of Talent and Recruiting at Forward Partners, who had one task for the afternoon: fill the role of Python Developer. Awkward.

The pair did clear the air during the interview, though. \\"It was totally awkward,\\" Buckland told the BBC. \\"So I approached it by asking him if he'd had a good commute that morning. We laughed it off and in a very British way I somehow ended up apologising\\".

That's exactly what happened to one man in London earlier this week. It's been recounted blow by blow on Twitter by Matt Buckland, the recruiter. His description of the scenario has been retweeted almost 14,000 times. In the tweet, he describes it as \\"karma\\" that a guy who pushed past him on the Tube and swore at him \\"just arrived for his interview with me\\". \\"I was on my way into work on the Tube on Monday morning during rush hour. I stood to one side to let a lady get by, and ended up blocking a man momentarily. He shoved past me, almost knocking me over, and shouted,\\" Buckland told BBC Trending. Despite a bad start, the day carried on as normal for Buckland, who is the head of talent and recruiting for Forward Partners, which funds early start-up businesses. He had an interview scheduled for 5:30pm. At 5:15pm the interviewee turned up. Lo and behold, it was the man who'd been so charming earlier. Buckland stepped away briefly to tell his Twitter followers about it and went back into the interview room. At this point the interviewee still hadn't made the connection. \\"It was totally awkward,\\" says Buckland. \\"So I approached it by asking him if he'd had a good commute that morning. We laughed it off and in a very British way I somehow ended up apologising.\\" By the time the interview had finished, the tweet had gone viral and people began sharing similar stories of their own online. It became a topic of discussion on Reddit, LinkedIn and Tumblr. A Facebook post of Buckland's tweet accompanied by the caption \\"Quick reminder: Nice continues to finish first\\" has been liked more than 400,000 times. So did the applicant get the job? In a word, no. \\"As it worked out, he wasn't right for the role,\\" says Buckland. \\"The job is still open.\\" But he's quick to stress that the applicant's lack of success wasn't because of the rude encounter. So would he have been legally entitled to take the scrape in the Tube into consideration? \\"He could have taken that into account if he'd wanted to,\\" says Colm O'Cinneide, a reader in law at University College London (UCL). \\"Employers have wide discretion to take lots of things into consideration, so long as it doesn't breach anti-discrimination laws which prohibit judgements based on race, ethnicity and gender.\\" Some have questioned Buckland for making fun of the applicant on social media, a charge he denies, \\"I don't think it's public shaming as he hasn't been named. I've been in contact with him and he's fine about it,\\" he said. \\"Although understandably, he doesn't want to do any interviews.\\" Blog by Anne-Marie Tomchak Next story: How to be a 'bad girl' in India You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"The pressure drop in the center of a developing storm system directly impacts a step of the hurricane formation process. Specifically, the pressure drop contributes to the formation of the hurricane's eye. When the pressure in the storm's center decreases, the surrounding warm and moist air surrounding the center is drawn inwards, causing the storm system to strengthen. As wind speeds increase, this inward flow of air begins to rotate due to the Coriolis effect, causing the organized thunderstorm activity to start spinning around the low-pressure center. When the wind speeds of the rotating storm reach at least 74 mph, it is classified as a hurricane. At this stage, the eye of the hurricane begins to form. The eye is characterized by a region of relatively calm weather and clear skies at the center of the storm, surrounded by the most intense weather and highest wind speeds in the eyewall. The formation of the eye is a direct result of the pressure drop in the storm's center. The low pressure forces the air to rise, and as it does so, it cools and condenses to form clouds and precipitation. The air then begins to diverge outward near the top of the storm around the low-pressure center, creating an area of descending air in the center with little to no precipitation and relatively calmer winds compared to the rest of the hurricane. Thus, the pressure drop happening in the storm's center directly impacts the step of the process where the hurricane's eye is formed. As it occurs during the progression of the storm from a tropical cyclone to a fully developed hurricane, the pressure drop plays a significant role in this transformation and the subsequent behavior of a hurricane."},{"question":"Short movie review: like quirky , slightly strange french films Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"Step 1: Identify keywords in the user's statement - Keywords: quirky, slightly strange, French films, critic, positively, negatively.

He didn't like any subjects except playing when he was at school. Of course he learned nothing and the bosses wouldn't use a man like him. He has to stay at home, but doesn't do any housework, only watches TV or lies on bed. It makes his parents angry. They want him to study something, he always think it difficult and doesn't listen to them. One day Robert was walking near a bookshop while some young men were talking about the writers. He heard the publishing house pays the writers a lot. He became interested in it. As soon as he got home, he began to write. But he couldn't write anything. At last he bought a book and copied a story. Then he posted it to the publishing house. He waited for nearly half a year, but didn't get any answers.

A) he wouldn't find any work B) he didn't study hard before C) he's too lazy to do any housework D) he isn't polite to them Answer:","response":"Robert's parents are angry with him for multiple reasons. Firstly, they are upset because he wouldn't find any work (A). Given that Robert didn't excel academically and lacks a good foundation in any subject, he struggles to secure a job that employers would deem him suitable for. This forces him to stay at home, thereby frustrating his parents who would have preferred for him to find work and contribute to society or support the family financially. Secondly, his parents are disappointed due to his lack of studying hard before (B). Robert's disinterest in his education led him to focus on playing instead of developing skills or absorbing useful knowledge. This further limited his opportunities when seeking employment. Moreover, Robert's parents are frustrated with his laziness and his unwillingness to do any housework (C). Rather than utilizing his time at home productively by helping with household chores or learning a new skill, Robert prefers to watch TV or lie in bed. This adds to his parents' annoyance as they feel he should be more responsible and contribute to the family’s well-being. Lastly, Robert's inability to improve himself, refusing to learn or acquire new knowledge, also contributes to his parents' resentment. They try to encourage him to study something, but he finds it difficult and doesn't listen to them, which exacerbates their disappointment in him. In conclusion, Robert's parents are angry with him because of a combination of factors: his inability to find work (A), not studying hard in the past (B), his laziness and unwillingness to contribute to housework (C), and his lack of self-improvement despite their encouragement.

Georgia took an early lead, with a 27-yard field goal from kicker Rodrigo Blankenship during the first quarter. The Auburn Tigers quickly responded with a touchdown in the second quarter, but Georgia managed to score another touchdown and maintain their lead in the first half of the game.

By the end of the match, Georgia emerged victorious, defeating Auburn with a final score of 28-7. This victory marked Georgia's 13th SEC championship and their first since 2005—an achievement that validated their impressive regular season performance.

A particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse, and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years.

Top-ranked USC kept its win-streak alive and secured its bid as one of the greatest teams in college football history with a narrow victory over second-ranked Texas in a Rose Bowl game that featured stellar performances from the heralded and unheralded alike. After a five-yard touchdown on a keeper by Heisman Finalist QB Vince Young put the Longhorns on top 7-0 half-way through the first quarter, fellow Heisman Finalist QB Matt Leinart revived an offense that looked sluggish on its first few possessions with three quick TD strikes to three different receivers and the Trojans found themselves up 21-7 at halftime. Aside from its first drive the Longhorn offense looked stale and one-dimensional. Things did not really get better in the third quarter either when Reggie Bush found his groove and then the endzone with a 32-yard run that improved the USC lead to 28-10 at the time. A David Pino field goal with a minute left in the third-quarter chipped the lead to 15, but Texas' chances still looked bleak. Apparently though, an entirely different Longhorn squad on both sides of the ball came out for the fourth quarter. USC punter Tom Malone's coffin-corner kick from the Longhorn's 36 went awry, allowing Aaron Ross to return the ball all the way to the USC four-yard line to set up a Ramonce Taylor touchdown. USC scored almost too quickly on its next possession, kicking a field goal to lead 31-20 with plenty of time to play at 10:37 in the fourth. On the second play of Texas' next possession, Vince Young put on one of the greatest shows in BCS history with a seemingly effortless 71-yard run that stunned the Trojans and left the millions watching in awe. He then took the snap from shotgun into the endzone on a draw to narrow the gap to just three after the successful two-point conversion. Texas forced USC into another short possession and punt to get the ball back on its own 12 yard line with about six minutes left in the game. It didn't quite take that long. A surprising burst from 270-pound freshman RB Henry Melton set up a 36-yard Pino field goal to cap unlikeliest of comebacks. The Trojans offensive weapons were just too much for the exhausted Longhorn's though. USC used runs by both Reggie Bush and LenDale White as well as four key completions by Leinart to prepare for a 43-yard field goal. Mario Danelo's kick sailed through the uprights with 31 seconds remaining and a Rose Bowl victory in sights. Young missed on deep attempts on the final Texas possession and the Trojans walked away the victors. The two-headed all-purpose monster of Bush and White combined for 360 yards from scrimmage and Leinart was spectacular in the biggest game of his illustrious collegiate career, going 22-40 for 290 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite leading his team to a successful comeback and turning even more heads with his rushing prowess, Young may want to rethink his NFL future after completing just eight of 22 passes, throwing zero touchdowns and coming up short when it truly counted. For now though, it's the same as it has been for three years, the Trojans are on top and everyone else is looking up at them. Player of the Game: Reggie Bush (241 yards from scrimmage, 2 TDs) Fiesta Bowl Notre Dame (9-3) 20, Ohio State (10-2) 27","response":"In an unforgettable Rose Bowl game, top-ranked USC managed to keep its win streak alive, securing its place as one of the greatest teams in college football history with a narrow victory over second-ranked Texas. The game showcased outstanding performances from both well-known and lesser-known players. After a slow start, USC quarterback Matt Leinart led the team to a 21-7 lead by halftime. Although Texas seemed to be faltering, Vince Young led a stunning revival in the fourth quarter, demonstrating incredible skill with a 71-yard run, and bringing the gap to just three points. However, USC's offensive weapons proved too much for Texas, with a combination of runs and key completions leading to a final field goal and a thrilling USC victory. Despite the loss, Young's performance during the game further solidified his impressive reputation, while USC's Reggie Bush was named Player of the Game, contributing 241 yards from scrimmage and 2 touchdowns. In the Fiesta Bowl, Ohio State triumphed over Notre Dame with a final score of 27-20."},{"question":"Avem o datorie, în calitate de deputaţi în Parlamentul European, de a scoate în evidenţă necesitatea respectării acestor obligaţii internaţionale, precum drepturile omului şi egalitatea dintre sexe, astfel încât demnitatea femeilor şi inocenţa a nenumăraţi copii congolezi să fie ocrotite.

P. Losman were unstoppable in the first quarter, connecting for 205 yards and two 83-yard touchdowns. Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win. Answer this question based on the article: What happened twice during the first quarter?","response":"In simple words, during the first quarter, the Bills' wide receiver Lee Evans and quarterback J.P. Losman connected for two 83-yard touchdowns. This means they worked together to score points for their team two times in the first part of the game by making a very long throw and catch."},{"question":"Article: Think of a word that means the same as the word you’re trying to learn. Then think of a song or quote that includes the word you already know, and switch the words. Sing or say these to yourself over and over again until you get them into your head. An example might be: “I’ve obtained you, babe” rather than “I’ve got you, babe” “What’s the big notion?” rather than “What’s the big idea?” Search for your word in the search engine function of online video sites. It can be really helpful to hear the word spoken, see the footage, and be able to link the word and the video. If you play the video enough times, you will start to hear the word in your head in the voice of the person on the video. This can help you differentiate it from all the other words you’re studying. Record yourself saying the words, then saying them in a sentence, or as part of a song or quote. Listen to your recording repeatedly. For many of us, listening to something over and over works even better than using flash cards. Using the list of vocabulary words you need to know, have a friend ask you what one means and then use it in a sentence.

The movie was about a group of friends trying to find a hidden treasure, but they didn't work together or have fun. They fought a lot, like when you fight with your siblings. This made me sad because friends should work together and help each other. Also, the movie was very hard to understand, like when our big brothers and sisters talk about something and we don't know what they are saying. The people in the movie spoke really fast and used big words, so I didn't know what was happening most of the time. The colors in the movie were not pretty either. It was like when we try to color a picture, but all the crayons are broken, and we don't have many colors to choose from. The movie looked dark and gloomy, which made it difficult to see what was going on. Lastly, the movie was very long, like when we are waiting for a birthday party and it feels like it's taking forever to come. I got bored and wanted to play outside or with my toys instead of watching the movie. So, my dear little friend, \\"Not-So-Fun Adventure\\" was not a good movie. I didn't like it because the friends didn't work together, it was hard to understand, the colors were not nice, and it was too long.

We can calculate a single man's work capacity using this formula: (Work done by a single man in a day) x (number of men) x (number of days) = Total work (acres of land) In our given situation: (Work done by a single man in a day) x (12 men) x (36 days) = 120 acres of land Now, solving for the work done by a single man in a day: (Work done by a single man in a day) = 120 acres / (12 men x 36 days) (Work done by a single man in a day) = 120 acres / 432 man-days (Work done by a single man in a day) = 0.2777 acres/man-day (approx.) Step 2: Determine how many acres of land 54 men can reap in 54 days. Now that we have the work capacity of a single man, we can use the same formula to find out how many acres 54 men can reap in 54 days. (Work done by a single man in a day) x (number of men) x (number of days) = Total work (acres of land) Using our data: (0.2777 acres/man-day) x (54 men) x (54 days) = Total work (acres of land) (0.2777) x (54 men) x (54 days) = Total work (acres of land) 809.16 acres (approx.) = Total work (acres of land) Since we need to find an answer from the given options: (C) 810 is the closest option to our calculated value of 809.16 acres. Therefore, 54 men can reap around 810 acres of land in 54 days."},{"question":"Given the below context: Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.

Article: Statuses are wonderful human inventions that enable us to get along with one another and to determine where we \\"fit\\" in society. In our everyday lives whenever we meet people, we always try to judge them in terms of their statuses. For example, we must judge whether the person in the library is a reader or a librarian, whether the telephone caller is a friend or a salesman and so on. Our statuses often vary with the people we meet, and change through life. Most of us can, at very high speed, assume the different statuses that various situations require. Much of social communication consists of recognizing and selecting among proper statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us. This means that we fit our actions to those of other people, based on a constant mental process of assessment and understanding. Although some of us find the task more difficult than others, most of us perform _ rather easily. A status has been compared to ready-made clothes. Within certain limits the buyer can choose style and material. But an American is not free to choose the clothes of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince. We must choose from among the clothing presented by our society. Furthermore, our choice is limited to a size that will fit, as well as by our wallet. Having made a choice within these limits, we can have certain changes made. But apart from small adjustments, we tend to be limited to what the stores have on their shelves. Statuses too come ready-made, and the range of choice among them is limited. Question: According to the writer, people often assume different statuses _ .

Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration. Question: \\"What was the name of the terrorist group President Bush and his administration concentrated on developing a strategy to defeat?\\" Answer: \\"Taliban\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"No, the answer is not correct.

Question: suppose person takes deeper breaths happens, how will it affect MORE sediment being transported. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"The process you have described is related to the transportation of sediment through natural processes, including erosion, transportation, and deposition, primarily driven by water and convection currents. The act of a person taking deeper breaths does not have a direct impact on these large-scale geological processes, as the amount of sediment being transported through rivers, lakes, and oceans depends on the energy available in the flowing water and movements of convection currents, which are mostly influenced by factors such as climate, precipitation, natural disasters, and tectonic forces. However, if we consider the question within the context of human activity having an indirect effect on sediment transport, it is possible to explore potential connections. The act of a person taking deeper breaths could be representative of activities that lead to reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions or air pollution. For instance, greater lung capacity and deeper breaths could be interpreted as a sign of better health, which might be achieved by living in a less polluted environment or following a lifestyle that has a smaller environmental footprint (e.g., walking instead of using a car). Reduced CO2 emissions, through responsible human activities, can contribute to mitigating climate change, which in turn could influence precipitation patterns and the intensity of erosion processes. In this context, the answer could be both A: more, and B: less, depending on the specific set of circumstances being considered. If reduced CO2 emissions lead to a decrease in flooding or extreme weather events, for instance, the amount of sediment being transported might decrease. On the other hand, in a hotter climate, ice caps and glaciers melt, potentially releasing more sediment into the world's water systems and causing more sediment to be transported. Both situations are possible, and both may even occur simultaneously in different geographic areas. In summary, while a person taking deeper breaths does not directly influence sediment transport, their actions and lifestyle choices might have indirect effects on global sediment transport processes, depending on broader environmental and human-induced factors that impact erosion, transportation, and deposition. The answer could be either A: more or B: less, based on the specific context being considered."},{"question":"Given the question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

They were ancestors. Who knows? But you’re not supposed to sit on them because you’re not supposed to expose your genitalia to them. I, however, was in a wetsuit for this whole shoot, and oh my god, they were so good for butt-itching.” Lawrence then went on to describe how she accidentally knocked one of the stones loose. “One rock that I was butt-scratching on ended up coming loose, and it was a giant boulder, and it rolled down the mountain, and it almost killed our sound guy,” she said. “It was this huge dramatic deal, and all the Hawaiians were like, ‘It’s the curse!’ And I’m in the corner going, ‘I’m your curse.

How old will Christian be in eight years? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step: 1. \\"In eight more years, Brian will be 40 years old.\\" Based on this statement, we can conclude that Brian is currently 40 - 8 = 32 years old. 2. \\"Christian is twice as old as Brian.\\" Knowing Brian's age, we can calculate Christian's age. Christian is 2 * 32 = 64 years old. 3. \\"How old will Christian be in eight years?\\" Now that we know Christian's current age, we can easily find out his age in eight years. Christian's age in eight years = 64 (current age) + 8 = 72 years old. Conclusion: In eight years, Christian will be 72 years old. The reason for this answer is derived from the given information that allows us to deduce Brian's current age and then use the age proportion to calculate Christian's current age. Finally, we add eight years to find Christian's age in the future."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Banqueting House , Whitehall , is the grandest and best known survivor of the architectural genre of banqueting house and the only remaining component of the Palace of Whitehall in London . The building is important in the history of English architecture as the first structure to be completed in the neo-classical style , which was to transform English architecture . Begun in 1619 and designed by Inigo Jones in a style influenced by Andrea Palladio , the Banqueting House was completed in 1622 at a cost of £ 15,618 , 27 years before King Charles I of England was executed on a scaffold in front of it in January 1649 . The building was controversially re-faced in Portland stone in the 19th century , though the details of the original façade were faithfully preserved . Today , the Banqueting House is a national monument , open to the public and preserved as a Grade I listed building . It is cared for by an independent charity -- Historic Royal Palaces -- which receives no funding from the British government or the Crown . - Wrest Park is a country estate located in Silsoe, Bedfordshire, England. It comprises Wrest Park, a Grade I listed country house, and Wrest Park Gardens, also Grade I listed, formal gardens surrounding the mansion. - Inigo Jones (15 July 1573 21 June 1652) was the first significant English architect (of Welsh ancestry) in the early modern period, and the first to employ Vitruvian rules of proportion and symmetry in his buildings. As the most notable architect in England, Jones was the first person who introduced the classical architecture of Rome and the Italian Renaissance to Britain. He left his mark on London by single buildings, such as the Queen's House which is the first building in England designed in a pure classical style, and the Banqueting House, Whitehall, as well as the layout for Covent Garden square which became a model for future developments in the West End. He made major contributions to stage design by his work as theatrical designer for several dozen masques, most by royal command and many in collaboration with Ben Jonson. - Whitehall is a road in the City of Westminster, Central London, which forms the first part of the A3212 road from Trafalgar Square to Chelsea. It is the main thoroughfare running south from Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. The street is recognised as the centre of Her Majesty's Government and is lined with numerous departments and ministries including the Ministry of Defence, Horse Guards and the Cabinet Office. Consequently, the name \\"Whitehall\\" is used as a metonym for British central governmental administration, and the geographic name for the surrounding area. - The Tudor period is the period between 1485 and 1603 in England and Wales and includes the Elizabethan period which ends with the completion of the reign of Elizabeth I in 1603. The Tudor period coincides with the rule of the Tudor dynasty in England whose first monarch was Henry VII (14571509). In terms of the entire century, Guy (1988) argues that \\"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors\\" than at any time in a thousand years. - Paxton's Tower is a Neo-Gothic folly erected in honour of Lord Nelson. It is situated on a hilltop near Llanarthney in the Towy Valley, Carmarthenshire, Wales. It is a visitor attraction that can be combined with a visit to the nearby National Botanic Garden of Wales. Its hilltop location provides views over the Botanic Gardens and the Towy valley. The tower is under care of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty and is a grade II* listed building. History. The tower was built by Sir William Paxton (1745-1824), a Scottish-born but London-raised merchant and banker, whose forefathers were from Auchencrow by Paxton, Berwickshire. Paxton made his first fortune while with the HEIC in Calcutta with Charles Cockerell, brother of the architect. He purchased the Middleton Hall estate about 1790 and built the tower circa 1806-1809. Designed by the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell (1754-1827), Middleton Hall was destroyed by fire in 1931. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - In English architecture, mainly from the Tudor period onwards, a banqueting house is a separate pavilion-like building reached through the gardens from the main residence, whose use is purely for entertaining, especially eating. Or it may be on the roof, as in many 16th-century prodigy houses. It may be raised for additional air or a vista, with a simple kitchen below, as at Hampton Court Palace and Wrest Park, and it may be richly decorated, but it normally contains no bedrooms, and typically a single room apart from any service spaces. The design is often ornamental, if not downright fanciful, and some are also follies, as in Paxton's Tower. There are usually plenty of windows, as appreciating the view was a large part of their purpose. Often they are built on a slope, so that from the front, only the door to the main room can be seen; the door to the servants' spaces underneath was hidden at the back (Wrest Park). The Banqueting House, Gibside is an example. - Hampton Court Palace is a royal palace in the town of East Molesey, Richmond upon Thames, Greater London, England, south west and upstream of central London on the River Thames. Redevelopment began to be carried out in 1515 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the King seized the palace for himself and later enlarged it. Along with St James's Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by King Henry VIII. - In architecture a pavilion (from French \\"pavillon\\", from Latin \\"papilio\\") has several meanings. In architectural terminology it refers to a subsidiary building that is either positioned separately or as an attachment to a main building. Often its function makes it an object of pleasure. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The Palace of Whitehall (or Palace of White Hall) was the main residence of the English monarchs in London from 1530 until 1698 when most of its structures, except for Inigo Jones's 1622 Banqueting House, were destroyed by fire. Before then, it had grown to be the largest palace in Europe with more than 1,500 rooms, overtaking the Vatican and Versailles. The palace gives its name, Whitehall, to the road on which many of the current administrative buildings of the UK government are situated, and hence metonymically to the central government itself.

Jessica is able to pour a beer better than Felicia because Choices: A). Jessica has never worked at a distillery.; B). Felicia has never worked at a distillery.;","response":"Jessica is able to pour a beer better than Felicia because B). Felicia has never worked at a distillery. This experience has provided Jessica with the necessary skills and expertise in handling and serving alcoholic beverages, particularly beer, while Felicia lacks such exposure to enhance her beer pouring abilities. Working in a distillery environment exposes staff members to important aspects of the brewing process, allowing them to understand the intricate steps that go into crafting a perfect beverage. This knowledge is vital when it comes to pouring a beer, as there are certain techniques and methods that must be followed to ensure a perfect pour and an enjoyable drinking experience for the consumer. For example, working at a distillery would have taught Jessica the proper tilt angle when pouring a beer from a tap, so as to minimize foam and ensure a consistent flow of beer. Additionally, she would have gained experience in managing the speed of the pour and understanding the characteristics of different types of beer, such as ales, lagers, and stouts. These elements are crucial when pouring a beer because they determine the optimal temperature and the appropriate glassware for serving. Moreover, working at a distillery would have given Jessica the opportunity to interact with other professionals in the industry, such as brewers, product developers, and other skilled bartenders, which would have continuously honed her beer-pouring skills. This interaction helps build a strong foundation of knowledge and best practices through experience sharing and continuous feedback. As such, Jessica's distillery experience would have provided her with numerous opportunities to practice and perfect her beer pouring abilities, while also giving her a solid appreciation for the craft and artistry involved in brewing and serving these beverages. In contrast, Felicia's lack of distillery experience means she has not been exposed to the same level of instruction and practical hands-on learning that Jessica has. As a result, she may be less familiar with the specific techniques and nuances of pouring beer and might struggle with aspects such as controlling foam, selecting the appropriate glassware, or understanding how different beer types should be poured and served. In conclusion, Jessica's advantage over Felicia in pouring beer mainly stems from her distillery experience, which has allowed her to refine her skills, acquire invaluable knowledge about the brewing process, and develop a better understanding of the various factors that contribute to an enjoyable beer-pouring and drinking experience. This background has equipped Jessica with the mastery and proficiency necessary to outperform Felicia in this particular aspect and ensures that customers can appreciate the best qualities of their beverages."},{"question":"Q: Title: Microsoft Windows NT Server 4 Readiness Review Review: I have read reviews that state how people often overlook the real purpose of this book, but I have to disagree.

At the coffee shop Erin prepared the beverage for Christine, since Choose from: A). Erin was the barista.. B). Christine was the barista..","response":"B). Christine was the barista. As Christine, the barista, bustled about behind the espresso machine, Erin observed her friend's smooth, efficient movements. Demonstrating expert skill, Christine prepared the beverages, taking care to cater to her customers' individual preferences. From years of working together, Christine and Erin had mastered each other's shorthand communications—an essential skill in the fast-paced coffee shop. Erin observed the steady stream of people coming in to order their caffeinated drinks, the scent of freshly ground coffee beans permeating the air. She glanced around the cozy coffee shop, taking note of the eclectic mix of customers. Young professionals tapped away at their laptops, college students huddled over textbooks, and elderly patrons engaged in lively conversations. Gleaming bronze accents and plush cushions added warmth and comfort to the quaint establishment. While Christine savored the short-lived quiet moments between customers, Erin approached the counter to chat with her friend. They had been inseparable since they were children, and it was Christine who encouraged Erin to apply as a barista at the coffee shop. Although Erin ultimately found her passion in the kitchen as a pastry chef, the tight-knit group that maintained the bustling coffee shop felt like family. Erin often reminisced about her early days working alongside Christine, marveling at how far they’d come. Christine grinned at Erin as she finished preparing a caramel macchiato. Handing it off to its eager recipient, she grabbed a plain black apron hanging from a nearby hook and draped it over Erin's shoulders. It was tradition for Erin to don Christine's apron whenever she joined her behind the counter, and they delighted in the playful ritual. Leaning on the counter and watching Christine work her magic, Erin pitched in where she could—serving customers, restocking supplies, and doing her best to keep up with her friend's lightning-fast pace. Over the din of the coffee grinder, they caught up on recent events, exchanged inside jokes, and even slipped in a few moments of companionable silence. It was Erin's favorite part of their friendship—how they could comfortably exist in each other's presence without the need for constant conversation. In a lull between customers, Christine pulled out a small box from under the counter and presented it to Erin. Her eyes shone with excitement as Erin removed the simple gold bow and lifted the lid. Inside lay a delicate gold necklace adorned with a coffee bean charm—the perfect homage to the place where their friendship had grown stronger. As a pang of gratefulness swelled in Erin's chest, she reflected on the many shared cups of coffee that had fueled their bond—from the early days of high school to even now. Christine’s thoughtful gesture reaffirmed all they had accomplished together in the coffee shop and beyond. Overcome with emotion, Erin enveloped Christine in a heartfelt hug. The embrace lingered a moment longer than usual—a testament to the significance the coffee shop held for both women. Today, as Erin prepared the beverage for Christine, she couldn't help but smile at the beautiful journey that had led them here. The coffee shop was not only a source of warmth, comfort, and delicious drinks but also the foundation of a cherished friendship that would continue to endure, as strong and as satisfying as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee."},{"question":"Given the question: Given the following context: Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany. In 2014, the heirs of the artist, in... answer the following question: What two movements did the man who taught a variety of positions help influence toward the end of his life? The answer is:","response":"El Lissitzky, a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist, and architect, significantly influenced two key movements towards the end of his life: the Bauhaus and the Constructivist movements. The Bauhaus movement, which emerged in Germany in the early 20th century, sought to unite art, craft, and technology. It focused on the idea that design and architecture should serve the needs of society and promote efficiency and functionality. El Lissitzky's work, particularly his graphic design and typography, greatly influenced this movement. His emphasis on goal-oriented creation and the belief that the artist could be an agent for change resonated with the Bauhaus' core principles. The Constructivist movement, which originated in Russia, was an artistic and architectural movement emphasizing abstraction, geometry, and the use of industrial materials. It aimed to reflect the modern industrial society and the ideals of the Soviet Union. El Lissitzky's work in the development of Suprematism with Kazimir Malevich and his extensive experience designing exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union played a significant role in shaping the Constructivist movement. His experiments with production techniques and stylistic devices became integral to the movement's visual language. Throughout his career, El Lissitzky consistently exchanged ideas and spread his beliefs across various positions, schools, and artistic media. As a result, he profoundly impacted the development and direction of the Bauhaus and Constructivist movements towards the end of his life."},{"question":"What is a random fact?","response":"A random fact pertains to an unexpected, interesting, or unique piece of information about a given subject or topic. These facts could be about science, history, animals, geography, arts, or almost any sphere of knowledge. For the purpose of providing an example, let's dive deep into the random fact about the honeybee and its sleep pattern. Honeybees, scientifically known as Apis mellifera, are fascinating creatures that play a crucial role in the ecosystem due to their pollination action. They have complex societies, sophisticated behaviors, and evidently, interesting sleep patterns. What might surprise you is that these industrious insects, just like humans, require sleep to function well. Remarkably, honeybees sleep between five and eight hours a day, and they take these in the night. Even more astonishing is how young bees and older bees have different sleeping patterns. Older worker bees tend to have erratic sleep schedules, sometimes sleeping outside the hive, while younger bees usually sleep within the bees' nest. Now, observing a bee sleep can be somewhat challenging since they do not have eyelids to close. So, scientists look at the bee's antennae to determine if it's asleep. Sleeping bees' antennae hang down, and their body slows down to immobility despite being on their feet. Why do they sleep, you may ask? Their sleep appears to be incredibly significant for their memory consolidation. Biologists theorize that bees, similar to humans, might dream during their sleep, processing and consolidating their memory from their waking hours. For bees, this consolidation is crucial for remembering efficient routes between the flowers and their hive. So, our random fact is that honeybees sleep similar to humans in terms of hours, they do it for memory consolidation, and the difference lies in the disconnect between their sleep postures compared to ours and the fact that they don’t have eyelids. It's a testament to the fascinating complexity of the natural world and how something seemingly as mundane as sleeping can take on intriguing variations across different species. In conclusion, the random fact here teaches us that just like humans, honeybees require sleep to function their best, providing a unique connection between us and the hardworking pollinators of our planet. This snippet may seem a simple piece of trivia, but it is part of a vast array of knowledge that contributes to our understanding of the world around us."},{"question":"What is a shorter version of this: red sox executives confirmed wednesday that they plan to make fenway park their permanent home and stated bluntly that their decision comes with \`\` no strings attached , '' though they would like to see parking and public transit improvements in the neighborhood .","response":"Red Sox execs confirmed Fenway Park as their permanent home with \\"no strings attached,\\" but desire parking and transit upgrades in the area.

The premise describes a woman wearing brown boots and holding a red cup. 2. The woman is walking through a large outdoor crowd. 3. The hypothesis suggests that the woman is drinking alcohol at a concert. Now, let's see if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise: - The premise doesn't mention what the woman is drinking. It could be alcohol, but it could also be a non-alcoholic beverage. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the woman is drinking alcohol from the premise alone. - The premise mentions a large outdoor crowd but doesn't specify that the crowd is at a concert. A large outdoor crowd could be at a festival, fair, or any other gathering. Consequently, we lack support to conclude that the location is a concert.

The painfully lengthy runtime of over three hours drags the audience through a cliched romance with little to no surprises, refusing to let go even as viewers yearn for an iceberg to break the monotony. Touting itself as an accurate portrayal of the tragic ship's voyage, the movie is riddled with historical inaccuracies that amateur historians could point out with ease. Finally, the ship's ensemble of passengers mostly feel like mere background props, their characters desperately underdeveloped, especially when pitted against the predictable Rose and Jack. In the end, Titanic's ambition is no match for its disappointment, and one cannot help but wish for a lifeboat back to dry land."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

He may have been a sailor on privateer ships during Queen Anne's War before settling on the Bahamian island of New Providence, a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold, whose crew Teach joined sometime around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet, but toward the end of 1717 Hornigold retired from piracy, taking two vessels with him. - A television network is a telecommunications network for distribution of television program content, whereby a central operation provides programming to many television stations or pay television providers.

The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. and the situation: Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health. Answer the following question: Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim?","response":"Dan, the normal patient, had a higher number of normal red blood cells compared to Jim, who suffered from sickle-cell anemia. While the question specifies that Dan and Jim had the same number of red blood cells, it is important to note that the quality and functionality of these cells differed significantly due to Jim's sickle-cell anemia. The crescent-shaped cells caused by this condition inhibit proper oxygen transportation and lead to various health issues, making Jim's overall well-being and health worse than Dan's."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given two lists of numbers and you need to calculate the intersection between these two lists.

The strike was fought vigorously by the coal mine operators association and its steering committee, which included Welborn, president of CF&I, a spokesman for the coal operators. Rockefeller's operative, Lamont Montgomery Bowers, remained in the background. Few miners actually belonged to the union or participated in the strike call, but the majority honored it. Strikebreakers (called \\"scabs\\") were threatened and sometimes attacked. Both sides purchased substantial arms and ammunition. Striking miners were forced to abandon their homes in company towns and lived in tent cities erected by the union, such as the tent city at Ludlow, a railway stop north of Trinidad. Under the protection of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, a substantial portion of the troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado. Due to reduced demand for coal, resulting from an economic downturn, many of CF&I's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects. The casualties suffered at Ludlow were successfully labeled a massacre and mobilized public opinion against the Rockefellers and the coal industry. The United States Commission on Industrial Relations conducted extensive hearings, singling out John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefellers' relationship with Bowers for special attention. Bowers was relieved of duty and Wellborn restored to control in 1915, then industrial relations improved. Rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized the seriousness of the event. When testifying on the Ludlow Massacre, and asked what action he would have taken as Director, John D. Rockefeller stated, \\"I would have taken no action. I would have deplored the necessity which compelled the officers of the company to resort to such measures to supplement the State forces to maintain law and order.\\" Rockefeller admitted that he had made no attempt to bring the militiamen to justice. Answer this question \\"What was the result?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"The result of the strike and the Ludlow Massacre was that it brought unwanted national attention to Colorado and the coal industry, and public opinion turned against the Rockefellers. Many of the coal mines never reopened, leaving many men without work. The union had to stop providing strike benefits, leading to poverty in the coal fields. Relief programs were organized to help the unemployed miners. Changes in industrial relations were made, and although Rockefeller denied responsibility, the United States Commission on Industrial Relations investigated the incident and focused on the Rockefellers and their relationship with Bowers."},{"question":"Из достигнутых на встречах договоренностей представители автодилеров не выполнили ни одной - полный перечень выпускаемых в Японии автомобилей, а также аукционная статистика по их продаже в Японии, о которых так много и настойчиво говорили автодилеры, обещая их \\"завтра же\\" направить таможенникам, в ДВТУ до сих пор не поступили.

Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. Ellington was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1965 but no prize was ultimately awarded that year. Then 66 years old, he joked: \\"Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn't want me to be famous too young.\\" In 1999 he was posthumously awarded a special Pulitzer Prize \\"commemorating the centennial year of his birth, in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.\\" In September 1965, he premiered the first of his Sacred Concerts. He created a jazz Christian liturgy. Although the work received mixed reviews, Ellington was proud of the composition and performed it dozens of times. This concert was followed by two others of the same type in 1968 and 1973, known as the Second and Third Sacred Concerts. These generated controversy in what was already a tumultuous time in the United States. Many saw the Sacred Music suites as an attempt to reinforce commercial support for organized religion, though Ellington simply said it was \\"the most important thing I've done\\". The Steinway piano upon which the Sacred Concerts were composed is part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Like Haydn and Mozart, Ellington conducted his orchestra from the piano - he always played the keyboard parts when the Sacred Concerts were performed. Despite his advancing age (he turned 65 in the spring of 1964), Ellington showed no sign of slowing down as he continued to make vital and innovative recordings, including The Far East Suite (1966), New Orleans Suite (1970), Latin American Suite (1972) and The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse (1971), much of it inspired by his world tours. It was during this time that he recorded his only album with Frank Sinatra, entitled Francis A. & Edward K. (1967). Although he made two more stage appearances before his death, Ellington performed what is considered his final full concert in a ballroom at Northern Illinois University on March 20, 1974. The last three shows Ellington and his orchestra performed were one on March 21, 1973 at Purdue University's Hall of Music and two on March 22, 1973 at the Sturges-Young Auditorium in Sturgis, Michigan.

The film delves into the realm of social inequality and human nature, while managing to maintain a delicate balance between humor, suspense, and empathy. Set in South Korea, the story follows the impoverished Kim family comprising of the father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), his wife Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), and their young adult children, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and Ki-jung (Park So-dam). The Kims, living in a cramped semi-basement apartment, find solace in the world of street hustling. The narrative takes a dramatic turn when Ki-woo is hired by the wealthy Park family to tutor their daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so). What follows is a cleverly orchestrated infiltration of the Park family by the Kims, engulfing the viewers in a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Bong Joon-ho's ingenious storytelling is evident in the manner he subtly weaves a biting social critique through the film's nuanced character development. The Park family, ensconced in their opulent life of luxury and extravagance, is portrayed as almost oblivious to the struggles of the Kims, who are desperate enough to resort to deception just to secure a decent life. \\"Parasite\\" highlights how social class divides can permeate all aspects of human existence, from relationships and trust to the consequent envy and bitterness prevailing in these separations. The film's careful attention to visual storytelling, such as the stark contrast between the lavish Park mansion and the squalid semi-basement apartment of the Kim family, effectively supports this theme. One of the key strengths of \\"Parasite\\" is its profoundly empathetic representation of both the rich and poor families. The film refuses to paint either family as villains or victims, allowing the audience to comprehend the perspective and motives of each character. This nuance is further heightened by the remarkable performances of the ensemble cast, with Song Kang-ho and Choi Woo-shik deserving special mention. Among the technical aspects, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography is exceptional, capturing not only the well-crafted sets and stunning locations but also the diverse emotions that make up the essence of the film. The editing by Yang Jin-mo plays a crucial role in maintaining the tempo of the storytelling, allowing for seamless transitions between tension and humor. In conclusion, \\"Parasite\\" is a film that offers a rare blend of entertainment, visual excellence, and thought-provoking narrative. Bong Joon-ho takes the viewers on an unforgettable journey that challenges the boundaries of conventional storytelling and leaves an indelible mark on the audience. The film's universal appeal is undeniable, as it transcends cultural barriers and speaks to the core of human nature and the dark corners it can inhabit. Parasite is truly a mesmerizing work of art and a testament to Bong Joon-ho's prowess as a master storyteller."},{"question":"Bloggingheads.tv (sometimes abbreviated \\"bhtv\\") is a political, world events, philosophy, and science video blog discussion site in which the participants take part in an active back and forth conversation via webcam which is then broadcast online to viewers.

They both ask for places to visit in Kerala, but with different focus points. The first question asks for \\"good places to visit in Kerala on tour,\\" which implies popular or well-known places that tourists often visit. These would be the typical places you might find in a travel guide. To answer this question, I would research popular tourist destinations in Kerala, including: 1. Munnar: A hill station famous for its tea plantations and beautiful landscapes. 2. Alleppey: Known as the \\"Venice of the East\\" for its backwaters and houseboat experiences. 3. Kochi: A port city with a rich history and cultural attractions such as Fort Kochi and Mattancherry Palace. 4. Wayanad: A rural district with wildlife sanctuaries and natural attractions. 5. Thekkady: Home to the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary for nature and wildlife enthusiasts. 6. Varkala: A coastal town with a beautiful cliffside beach and historical sites. The second question asks for \\"off-the-beaten-path places\\" in Kerala, which means less touristy, more remote, or hidden gems that may not be as widely known. To answer this question, I would search for less touristy locations and unique experiences in Kerala, such as: 1. Gavi: A lesser-known eco-tourism destination with wildlife, trekking, and camping opportunities. 2. Kumbalangi: A model fishing village providing an authentic experience of rural life in Kerala. 3. Kakkathuruthu: A small, tranquil island in the backwaters and an ideal spot for birdwatching. 4. Mararikulam: A serene village with pristine beaches, free from commercialization. 5. Tholpetty: A part of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, lesser known for its wildlife encounters. 6. Silent Valley National Park: A biodiversity hotspot with unique flora and fauna, away from the usual tourist spots.

With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

This is an important process as it assists in detoxifying the body. The liver's conversion of ammonia into urea forms part of the urea cycle. The urea cycle is crucial for the removal of excess nitrogen in our bodies, which are byproducts of our body's natural metabolic process. Ammonia is produced when the proteins we consume are broken down by our digestive system. This chemical is highly toxic even at low concentrations and can cause harm if left to accumulate in our bloodstream. This is why it is so important that our bodies convert it into a less harmful substance, such as urea. Upon the liver converting ammonia into urea, the urea is then released into the bloodstream. The bloodstream carries it to the kidneys and there it is filtered out of the blood. From the kidneys, urea, along with water and other waste substances, forms urine. Ultimately, the urine is excreted from the body through urination. This process, particularly the final step, is part of the body’s critical functions of effectively removing waste, detoxification, and maintaining a stable internal environment. Without this ability to convert dangerous waste into a form that can be safely removed, the body would predictably experience ammonia toxicity. Hence, the critical and final step in the liver function process you've described is the conversion of ammonia to urea, providing the body a way to safely dispose of toxic byproducts. This is how the liver maintains the metabolic harmony of the body and contributes to overall health."},{"question":"Given the question: Trisha dreamed of being a Playboy Bunny since the days she still had buck-teeth and fried egg boobs. She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm. Weekend nights, I drove her out to the dual carriageway truck-stop where she found a faster way to make her fortune in the fogged-up cabs.

I heard great things about this restaurant so we decided to give it a try when we came down for Spring Training. For a steakhouse, I was not impressed. I threw out half of my steak due to fat and grizzle. The waiter was not very good - had to continue asking for refills on our drinks. We hardly saw him until our food got there, then within 4 minutes saw him twice and he asked how everything was. If he had looked, he would have noticed that we spent our time cutting up our kids' steaks. Then he came back 10-15 minutes later while we were still eating and he asked if we needed boxes or wanted dessert. What? We are still eating! Didn't see him again for about 10-15 minutes when he gave us our check! Excuse me, is that how they wait tables here in AZ? What happened to manners or professionalism? When we told him we wanted dessert to go, we had everything within 5 minutes! Where was this person when I needed a drink refill? Oh yes, and that box that was once offered was not offered again and he never mentioned anything about the pile of fat and grizzle on the plate. Another interesting point - was told that if you wanted the bleu cheese dressing that there would be a small charge. He never mentioned that milk refills would be extra. Humm, if someone recommends this place to me again, I would really have to see how desperate I was for food....Choose from: *negative *positive I think the answer is","response":"*negative In this review, the person is saying many things that did not make them happy. They did not like their steak because it had too much fat. They did not like the waiter because they had to keep asking for more drinks and the waiter was not around a lot.

They also did not like that they were not told that refills on milk would cost extra. All of these things make them feel not so good about the restaurant.

I guess I could have been a little more careful to check the dimensions but I would expect that even a small fan such as this one could put out some type of air. I keep it now to dry my nail polish but it is not useful for anything else. Is this product review negative?","response":"Yes, this product review can be considered negative based on the following points: 1. Lack of satisfaction with the product's performance: The reviewer expressed their disappointment with the fan's ability to produce adequate airflow. This indicates that the fan did not meet the expectations that the reviewer had when purchasing the product. A well-functioning fan should effectively circulate the air, but in this case, it seems to fall short. 2. Issue with dimensions: The reviewer mentions that they did not thoroughly check the dimensions of the fan before purchasing it, which may have contributed to their overall dissatisfaction. However, this issue does not negate the overall tone of the review being negative since it still doesn't meet their expectations in terms of airflow. 3. Limited utility: The reviewer states that they now only use the fan for drying their nail polish, implying that it isn't useful for more general purposes, such as cooling a room or providing a refreshing breeze. This further emphasizes the negative perception of the product, as it does not serve the primary function of a typical fan. 4. Absence of positive feedback: In the review, there is a lack of positive comments or compliments about the fan. This may indicate that the reviewer has not found any redeeming qualities or features in the product that could potentially outweigh the negative aspects mentioned. In conclusion, based on the dissatisfaction with the performance, issues with dimensions, limited utility, and absence of positive feedback, this product review can be classified as negative. The reviewer seems unsatisfied with their purchase and feels that the fan is not worth using for anything other than drying nail polish, which is a significantly limited use for a product that is meant to serve a broader purpose."},{"question":"The Norwegian ship Elizabeth Bergen smashed into cliffs at Gunwalloe, Cornwall, during a storm in 1846. Three crew members were killed but Henry Cuttance, landlord of the Ship Inn rescued the ship's master and three other men. The King of Norway rewarded his bravery with a silver mug. Graham Bazley, of Penzance auctioneers WH Lane, said the tankard achieved well in excess of the guide price of £5,500 after \\"fierce telephone bidding\\". The Elizabeth Bergen was wrecked on 20 November 1846 while carrying a cargo of salt back to Norway. As the vessel tried to weather the storm off Cornwall's south coast it was blown aground at the base of the cliffs in Gunwalloe and, according to reports at the time, was \\"smashed to matchsticks\\" within half an hour. Mr Cuttance hauled three of the ship's company and its master from the wreckage before sending out a search party to look for survivors. On finding three more men cowering at the bottom of the cliffs, Mr Cuttance and his helpers lowered hot coffee and bread to the stranded men while they prepared a chair on a rope to haul them to safety in a 10-hour operation. In recognition of Mr Cuttance's heroism the King of Norway presented him with a silver tankard. It was auctioned earlier along with a number of other items from Mr Cuttance's colourful life, including a ledger detailing his stock and sales of smuggled goods which included cheese, brandy and bales of cotton.

El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.

Ensuring that advertisements and labels accurately depict the product's characteristics is crucial for consumers to make informed decisions about their purchases. To successfully serve as advocates for consumers, the following measures can be implemented: 1. Establishing clear guidelines: Regulatory bodies responsible for monitoring advertising and labeling practices must create comprehensive guidelines that clearly define the principles and standards that need to be followed by companies.

Regular monitoring and enforcement: Effective monitoring mechanisms must be put in place to ensure adherence to the established guidelines. In case of non-compliance, regulators must have the authority to enforce penalties or issue corrective actions to companies that fail to meet the set standards. 3. Consumer education: Educating consumers on their rights and the importance of accurate advertising and labeling is essential to empower them in making informed decisions. Public awareness campaigns and educational programs can be initiated to disseminate information on consumer protection laws and encourage vigilant practices. 4.

He shares a close bond with his stepbrother, Martin Baxter, who is two years younger. When they were kids, they promised to always be there for each other and to protect their family, especially their younger sister, Debbie. Debbie, a sweet and talented girl, disappears under mysterious circumstances one day as she returns home from school. The disappearance of their beloved sister devastates Ethan and Martin. To find Debbie, they dedicate their lives to the search and postpone their academic and career pursuits. Their determination, however, is met with little success as the initial years yield no concrete leads regarding Debbie's whereabouts. The family starts losing hope over time, but Ethan and Martin can't let go of their sister's memory. Act 2: A New Lead and the Journey Begins As the movie reaches its fifth year since Debbie's disappearance, Ethan and Martin receive an anonymous tip: a photograph of a young woman who appears to be a grown-up Debbie, living in a remote village in a foreign country. Despite doubts and the uncertainty around the authenticity of the photograph, the brothers are driven by their undying longing to reunite with their sister and decide to embark on an international quest to find her. Throughout their journey, Ethan and Martin face numerous challenges, including financial constraints, as they leave their jobs to focus on the search. The harsh terrains and linguistic barriers of the unfamiliar land present hurdles as they follow clues to uncover the truth about Debbie's disappearance. They also encounter dangerous cross-border criminals who are somehow linked to Debbie's kidnappers. Act 3: Overcoming Obstacles, Unfolding the Truth As they unravel the criminal network behind the abduction, Ethan and Martin realize that Debbie was abducted due to a case of mistaken identity as she resembled the daughter of a wealthy businessman. The kidnappers had used her in a ransom plot that failed and had sold her to a human trafficking group. The brothers grow increasingly determined to bring down the criminals and save their sister as they continue their relentless pursuit. During their investigation, they become aware that local authorities are entangled with the trafficking network, making their mission perilous. The brothers manage to enlist the help of a rogue officer, Sofia, who is also seeking revenge against the network for her sister's death. Act 4: The Climactic Rescue and Resolution The thrilling climax of the movie sees Ethan, Martin, and Sofia breaking into a hidden compound where the trafficking victims are held, including Debbie. They rescue the victims in a daring raid and confront the criminal masterminds, who are eventually arrested. The raid also brings down the corrupt authorities involved in the trafficking. The film ends with an emotional reunion between the siblings, who have finally found Debbie after five years of struggle and despair. The family returns home with renewed hope and dedication to help other families who have lost their loved ones to human trafficking. The Quest for Debbie emphasizes the strength of familial bonds, the unwavering persistence of two brothers, and the power of hope in overcoming great adversity."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Question: suppose during hunting happens, how will it affect more. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"The question asks to analyze the influence of hunting on the chain of events described for forest fires, with particular emphasis on the second effect – the animals living in the forest having fewer places to hide. To thoroughly analyze the influence of hunting on these events, it is important to first understand the order of changes that occur after a forest fire and the impacts of hunting on ecosystems. Forest fires, as described in the process, have several consequences on an ecosystem: 1. Forest fires burn and destroy vegetation, leading to a reduction in the habitat and available hiding places for animals. 2. Predators gain an advantage as they can find prey more easily due to the lack of hiding places. 3. Many birds will fly away from the area to avoid danger or to find new habitats and sources of food. 4. The water temperature increases, which can harm fish and other aquatic species. Now, let's consider the impact of hunting on these events: Hunting is the act of chasing, capturing, and killing wild animals for food, sport, or population control, and it inevitably leads to a reduction in the number of animals in the ecosystem. When hunting is introduced to the mentioned chain of events, several consequences arise. 1. The reduction in the number of animals could mean that there are fewer individuals for predators to target. This could lead to a decrease in the predator population due to lack of food or force them to leave the area in search of prey. 2. As hunting reduces the population of certain species, other species, both prey, and predator might be indirectly affected. This phenomenon is known as a trophic cascade. 3. The reduction in the total prey population could also affect the efficiency of predators in finding prey, as there would be fewer tracks and movements for predators to follow. 4. Hunting might push certain populations to adapt to scarcity, leading to shifts in behavior, habitat, and social structures. Now, focusing on the second effect mentioned: \\"The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide.\\" Hunting would lead to a direct impact on the number of animals in the ecosystem, and thus, their ability to find hiding places would be further compromised, especially for those species targeted by hunters. Prey animals experiencing an increase in hunting pressure may attempt to seek out new hiding places in order to evade both hunters and non-human predators. Under the influence of hunting, the remaining cover after a forest fire may be further limited or occupied in a competitive manner. In conclusion, it can be stated that the impact of hunting during the described chain of events would have a significant effect on the second effect mentioned, and the availability of hiding places for forest-dwelling animals would likely be more compromised. The introduction of hunting into an ecosystem left fragile by a forest fire could further destabilize it, and depending on factors such as species diversity, habitat destruction, and intensity of hunting, these effects could vary in magnitude."},{"question":"Canon hat populären Gehörte wiederholte Anfragen seiner Nutzer über das Fehlen von manuellen Kontrollen in den HD-Videomodus der 5D Mark II und hat endlich eine neue Firmware entwickelt, um diese Funktionen freizuschalten.

A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The French national census of 2012 estimated the population of Sedan to be 119,551. This information can be inferred from the context provided, which discusses various events that took place during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), including the capture of Napoleon III and his troops at Sedan. Sedan is a historical town located in the Ardennes region of north-eastern France, near the border with Belgium. It played a significant role in both the Franco-Prussian War and World War II. During the Franco-Prussian War, the French Army of Châlons, under Emperor Napoleon III, marched toward Sedan to intercept the Prussian forces led by King William I and General Helmuth von Moltke. The French forces were defeated at the Battle of Sedan in 1870, leading to the capture of Napoleon III and a significant number of French soldiers. The French Marines and naval infantry, initially intended for an invasion of northern Germany, were redirected to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and were subsequently captured as well at Sedan. This left a void in the French military leadership, as many skilled officers were now in captivity. Consequently, naval officers were reassigned from their ships to command the largely untrained Garde Mobile reservists, further disrupting the French military efforts. As the naval blockade of the north German ports became less effective due to autumn storms and the withdrawal of French ships, the French navy ultimately abandoned the blockade in September 1870 and focused on guarding the English Channel for the rest of the war. The outcome of Battle of Sedan had severe consequences for France, as it contributed significantly to the country's ultimate defeat in the war, leading to territorial losses and the collapse of the French Second Empire. Even though the city witnessed a momentous historical event, it has grown since then and adapted to modern times. According to the French national census of 2012, Sedan had an estimated population of 119,551, reflecting its importance as an urban center in north-eastern France. The city's rich history, particularly from the 19th and 20th centuries, has left a lasting impact on its identity, making it a significant location of interest for history enthusiasts."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A rider has fallen off a horse and is shielding himself from being trampled.\\" can we conclude that \\"The rider fell off of his bike.\\"?

A father has revealed in a brutally honest interview how he came to love the daughter with Down Syndrome that he had tried to get his wife to abort. Heath White, a pilot-turned-FBI agent from Waskom, Texas, said that his five-year-old daughter Paisley - one of three children - is now 'the light in the darkness' and an inspiration to his family. But this was not his sentiment in 2007 when he learned his wife Jennifer was carrying a baby with Downs, which was totally at odds with his image of a perfect family. Speaking to ESPN, he explained that he had always aimed for perfection - playing for sports teams throughout college, achieving a 4.0, enrolling in law school before coming a pilot - and the girl threatened to ruin that. When Paisley was 18 months old, White began writing a letter to Paisley, he shared with","response":"ESPN, that detailed the emotional journey he went through from disapproval and denial to acceptance and unconditional love for his daughter. This letter aimed to communicate to Paisley the incredibly life-changing impact she had on him and the entire family. In the letter, White described how his initial response to his wife's pregnancy and the revelation that their unborn child had Down Syndrome was one of fear, disappointment, and shame. He felt that having a child with Down Syndrome did not fit the successful and perfect image he had built for himself and his family. He admitted that he tried pressuring his wife, Jennifer, to have an abortion, but she courageously stood her ground and refused. As a result, Paisley was born, and slowly but surely, her presence in their lives began to change White's perspective and redefine his notions of a perfect family. Initially, White felt burdened by the responsibility of raising a child with special needs and struggled to accept the fact that she would never meet his unrealistic expectations of perfection. With time, however, he started to notice the unique ways in which Paisley communicated, the strength she displayed in the face of challenges, and the joy she brought to their family. As Paisley grew older, she became a symbol of love, resilience, and happiness for White and his family, defying their initial expectations and fears. He realized that by embracing her uniqueness, he was learning more about true love and kindness. That’s when he acknowledged that his perception of a perfect family was flawed and narrow-minded, and Paisley constituted an unexpected blessing that he initially failed to appreciate. Though the journey was difficult, White's transformation began when he set aside his ego, opened his heart, and let go of his preconceptions. Eventually, Paisley changed the entire family dynamic, uniting them with an unbreakable bond of love and acceptance. In the letter, White openly expressed gratitude to his daughter for teaching him the true meaning of love and perfection. He wanted to convey to Paisley that her presence in their lives not only challenged their long-held beliefs but also enriched their lives with the beauty of diversity and the power of unconditional love. White finished the letter by acknowledging that, despite his initial reluctance to accept her, Paisley was the catalyst for a profound shift in his values, ultimately making him a better father and person overall. White's brutally honest and heartrending letter highlights the immense importance of breaking down societal labels and prejudices surrounding disabilities. It serves as a testament to the transformative power of love and the enduring impact of family, no matter the circumstances. In the end, Paisley became the unexpected light in their lives, guiding them into embracing a more inclusive definition of perfection, love, and family."},{"question":"HMAS Brunei (L 127) - HMAS Brunei (L 127) is a Balikpapan class heavy landing craft operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Question What is a \\" Cleanse \\" ? Answer:","response":"A \\"cleanse\\" is a type of dietary program or regimen, often undertaken for a specific, limited period, aimed at eliminating toxins, impurities, and other unwanted substances from the body. The primary goal is to improve overall health, boost energy levels, enhance mental clarity, and promote weight loss. It typically involves consuming a variety of natural, unprocessed, and nutrient-dense foods and beverages while abstaining from unhealthy substances like caffeine, alcohol, processed foods, and sugar. There are several types of cleanses, each focusing on different aspects of health and employing various foods, drinks, and supplements to achieve specific objectives. Some common cleanses include: 1. Juice cleanses: These involve consuming fresh fruit and vegetable juices, often for about 3 to 7 days, to provide the body with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants while allowing the digestive system to rest and repair itself. 2. Colon cleanses: These focus on promoting a healthy digestive tract by removing built-up waste and promoting regular bowel movements. Methods include the use of supplements, colon hydrotherapy, or gentle herbal laxatives. 3. Liver cleansing: This approach aims to detoxify the liver, which is the body's primary organ responsible for filtering toxins and chemicals from the blood. It involves consuming specific foods and supplements known to support liver function and prevent the buildup of harmful substances. 4. Master Cleanse: Also known as the Lemonade Diet, this is a more extreme form of cleansing. It involves consuming only a mixture of water, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup for 7 to 14 days. This cleanse is not recommended for everyone and should be approached with caution. 5. Detox diets: These are structured meal plans that revolve around whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. They typically restrict certain food groups, additives, and other substances to help the body eliminate toxins. A cleanse can be beneficial for some, as it may help to reset eating habits, support weight loss, improve digestion and increase energy levels. However, it's essential to approach any cleanse with caution and consult a healthcare professional beforehand, particularly for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking medications. In the context you provided, you are undertaking a cleanse that involves green tea consumption and abstaining from your regular intake of coffee and black tea. Green tea is rich in antioxidants called catechins, which have been shown to support liver function and help detoxify the body. However, the abrupt change in your routine and reduction of caffeine intake might explain your feelings of exhaustion and irritability. It is important to listen to your body and adjust the cleanse as needed to ensure a safe and effective experience."},{"question":"Q: Fact 1: Cross-pollination increases genetic diversity. Fact 2: Evolution requires genetic diversity. Given the two facts above, cross-pollination increases something required by what? A:","response":"Given Fact 1: \\"Cross-pollination increases genetic diversity\\" and Fact 2: \\"Evolution requires genetic diversity,\\" cross-pollination increases something required by evolution. To explain this in detail, it is important to understand the definitions and mechanics of each term involved - cross-pollination, genetic diversity, and evolution. Cross-pollination is a biological process that transfers pollen grains from the anther, aka the male part of a flower, to the stigma, aka the female part of another flower. This results in the fertilization of plants of the same species. The offspring produced as a result of cross-pollination have a mix of characteristics from their two parent plants. This is one of the ways that adds to the variability among plants. Genetic diversity, as a concept, refers to the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It is what distinguishes one individual from another. A high level of genetic diversity offers a species several advantages. It improves the chances of survival of its population in changing environmental conditions because a large gene pool has more variants. These variants could be beneficial and enhance the survival skill and adaptability of a species. Now, evolution is a complex process built on the fundamental principle of survival of the fittest. It primarily involves changes in the inherited traits of species over generations. These changes occur through various mechanisms like mutation, migration, genetic drift, and most importantly, natural selection. For evolution to occur, genetic variation is required, as it promotes adaptability, which is a key to survival in a constantly changing environment. Given this understanding, it’s clear that cross-pollination, by increasing genetic diversity within a species, directly augments the vital requirement of evolution. The more genetic diversity there is in a population, the more potential there is for evolution to occur as there is more room for natural selection to choose the traits that would contribute to a species' survival. Therefore, cross-pollination does indeed increase something - genetic diversity - that is required by evolution, ultimately promoting the process of evolution."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: Where do people drive on the left on a motorway?

Answer:","response":"The name change from Madras to Chennai took place on July 17, 1996. The transformation was a result of a broader trend in India to replace colonial-era names with indigenous alternatives that carry linguistic, cultural, and historical significance. Established as a British settlement in 1639 and named Madras, the city was an essential center for British trade and administration in the South of India during the colonial era. Madras was constructed around the Fort St. George, which served as the administrative and military headquarters for the British East India Company. Over time, the settlement grew into a bustling metropolis, eventually becoming the capital of the Madras Presidency, a British Indian state that spanned a large portion of southeastern India. However, the name Madras does not hold particular significance in the local languages, such as Tamil. There is historical debate about the origin of the name 'Madras,' with some suggesting it derived from the nearby town of Madrasapattinam, while others claim it originates from \\"madras\\" meaning four in the Tamil language. Regardless of the etymology, the name was seen as a colonial imposition, which remained long after India gained independence in 1947. On the other hand, Chennai is the indigenous Tamil name for the city, and it has been in use for centuries. The name Chennai is derived from Chennapattinam, which was a small fishing village located just north of Fort St. George. Chennapattinam was named after the local chieftain, Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka, as his father's name was Chennappa Nayaka. Chennapattinam and the neighboring village of Madrasapattinam eventually merged, forming the foundation of the city we now know as Chennai. The renaming of the city aligns with the sentiments and aspirations of its native citizens. The government of Tamil Nadu, the state that houses Chennai, enacted the name change in an effort to emphasize the indigenous identity of the city and shed its colonial past. It was part of a nationwide initiative to rename numerous major cities, including Bombay (now Mumbai), Bangalore (now Bengaluru), and Calcutta (now Kolkata), among others. The change in name from Madras to Chennai signified a return to the city's roots, enabled by the growing sense of self-determination and identity of a post-colonial India. The reclamation of traditional names for various cities across the country represents an attempt to restore indigenous cultural identity and history in the current landscape."},{"question":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

With the help of team captain Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez, known as Benny by the others, Smalls becomes a proficient player. Smalls joins his new friends, Benny Rodriguez, Hamilton 'Ham' Porter, Michael 'Squints' Palledorous, Alan 'Yeah-Yeah' McClennon, Bertram Grover Weeks, Kenny DeNunez, Timmy Timmons and Tommy 'Repeat' Timmons on their many misadventures including being banned from the pool, besting a snooty long-time rival team, and getting sick on one of the rides at an amusement park. He then learns that many of the team's baseballs have ended up in Mr. Mertle's junkyard over the sandlot's back fence, which is protected by a giant dog known as \\"The Beast\\", who had allegedly eaten a kid foolish enough to enter it. One day, when Benny hits the hide off of the team's last ball, Smalls substitutes one from his stepfather's prized collection. When Ham hits this ball over the fence, Smalls reveals that the ball is special. To the team's horror, they learn the ball has Babe Ruth's autograph, making it valuable--something Smalls didn't know when he took it. The team constructs a progressively complex series of machines to recover it remotely, but each attempt ends in failure and the ball itself grows increasingly damaged due to attention from the Beast.[5][6] While Smalls prepares to face certain discipline from his stepfather for the loss of the signed baseball, Benny has a dream where Babe Ruth encourages him to follow his heart. Inspired by his idol, Benny climbs the fence the next day, resolving to retrieve the ball himself, but he is confronted by the Beast, a large English Mastiff.

Hypothesis: A person climbs pointy rocks with a rope .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","response":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, as both statements share similar essential components. However, there are differences in the level of detail and specificity between the premise and the hypothesis which need to be acknowledged. Let's break down both statements to better understand their similarities and differences. Premise: A man is climbing rocks with a rope. 1. The subject is a man. 2. The action being performed is climbing. 3. The object of the action is rocks. 4. A rope is being utilized in the action. Hypothesis: A person climbs pointy rocks with a rope. 1. The subject is a person (neutral in terms of gender). 2. The action being performed is climbing. 3. The object of the action is pointy rocks (more specific compared to just \\"rocks\\" in the premise). 4. A rope is being utilized in the action. As we examine the two statements, there are apparent similarities. In both the premise and the hypothesis, the subject is engaged in the act of climbing, using a rope as a tool. Additionally, the individual is ascending rocks, which is the goal of the activity. Nonetheless, there are distinctions in the degree of specificity. The premise mentions a man, while the hypothesis generalizes the subject by referring to a person. Consequently, the hypothesis is more flexible, given that it can encompass a wider variety of scenarios involving people of different genders. Additionally, the hypothesis introduces a modifier – \\"pointy\\" – to describe the rocks. In doing so, it provides more precision when characterizing the climbing environment. Despite these discrepancies, we can affirm that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The hypothesis takes a broader perspective, allowing for any person climbing rocks with a rope. The premise itself is a more specific instance, being that it involves a man climbing rocks with a rope. Since the premise explicitly fulfills the conditions outlined in the hypothesis, we can deduce that the hypothesis is accurate when the premise is considered true. In essence, if the premise is true – that a man is indeed climbing rocks with a rope – it is a valid assumption to conclude that the hypothesis – a person climbing pointy rocks with a rope – holds true as well. Although the hypothesis encompasses a more comprehensive range of scenarios, the premise's affirmation stays within those parameters."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

Users will have to opt in to the feature. Some see broader communication, while others see spam. Article:","response":"Title: Twitter's Direct Message Update: A Path to Broader Communication or a Gateway to Spam? Introduction: Twitter, the popular social media platform, continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape. In a recent update, the company has now made direct messages open to people users don't follow, a significant change in how users can communicate and interact with each other. However, with this new feature comes potential drawbacks that have ignited a debate about whether this update will lead to broader communication or open the floodgates for spam. Step 1: Explain the new feature and its requirements The new feature, which allows Twitter users to receive direct messages from people they don't follow, requires users to opt into the service. By doing so, users open their inbox to messages from any individual on the platform, creating new opportunities for networking and exposure. This change makes it much easier to connect with others who share interests, work in the same industry or have a question about a particular topic. Step 2: Discuss the potential pros of the update For some Twitter users, this update presents exciting possibilities for broader communication. By opting into the feature, users can engage in conversations with individuals they might not have otherwise had the chance to connect with, potentially leading to fruitful discussions, collaborations, or networking opportunities. Additionally, this feature could redefine public figure-fan interactions, enabling a more direct line of communication between celebrities, influencers, and their followers. Step 3: Address the concerns surrounding spam On the other hand, many users worry that this new feature will leave their direct message inboxes vulnerable to spam and unsolicited messages. With an open door policy for direct messages, spammers and bots could flood inboxes with unwanted content, making it challenging for users to sift through genuine messages. The influx of spam could also lead to privacy concerns, as more users could potentially receive inappropriate or harmful content. Step 4: Offer potential solutions to minimize spam influx To alleviate these concerns, Twitter could implement a more stringent verification process for accounts to reduce the likelihood of bots and spammers taking advantage of the new feature. The platform could also offer customizable message filtering options, enabling users to set specific parameters for what types of messages they receive. By doing so, users retain control over the content that enters their inbox while enjoying the benefits of an open direct message system. Conclusion: While the debate over Twitter's direct message update continues, it is clear that the new feature has the potential to redefine how users communicate and interact on the platform. As with any significant change, there will be both positive outcomes and challenges to face. It is up to Twitter and its user base to find a balance that cultivates meaningful connections while maintaining privacy and security. Only time will tell if this update ultimately proves to be a boon or a burden for the social media giant."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Charlie (David Schwimmer) is an ex-teacher turned disaffected call center employee who is fired on his first day. Distraught at being unable to provide for his daughter Emily and policewoman wife Penelope (Natascha McElhone), he is approached by former colleague Gus (Simon Pegg), an aspiring scam artist who presents Charlie with a seemingly snag-free plan to make some cash: blackmail Reverend Smalls, who is listed in the company database of visitors to illegal porn websites. Gus plans on extorting money from Reverend Smalls, with the intention of publicly exposing his secret shame should he refuse to pay. The normally cautious Charlie reluctantly agrees to play a part in the scam, confident that with the money he will garner from the deal he would be able to support his family. A teenage pageant queen Josie McBroom (Alice Eve), Gus's scheming one-night stand, forces herself into the scheme. Josie convinces Charlie and Gus that she should make the call to Smalls on the grounds that if either of them called, the police could trace their voices and connect them to the job. The plan goes into action, and Gus goes to Smalls' house where he is surprised by the Reverend wielding a gun. From outside the house two shots are heard.

The news comes as Leicester City Council announces that the preliminary work around this ambitious project could begin in 2016. This article will provide an overview of the war memorial, the significance of the new processional route, and its impact on the park and the community. Background: Victoria Park War Memorial Victoria Park, a site deriving its name from the monarch Queen Victoria, is an exceptional public park situated in the heart of Leicester City. Spanning an area of 69 acres, the park boasts a rich history and hosts numerous sports events and music festivals annually. Since its opening in 1883, Victoria Park has continued to evolve to cater to the needs of the local community. Located in the park is the war memorial, commonly referred to as the Arch of Remembrance. The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, a renowned British architect. Unveiled in 1925, it honors the brave men and women of Leicester who sacrificed their lives in World War I and subsequent conflicts. The memorial's distinguished design and poignant inscriptions evoke immense emotions, reminding visitors of the sacrifices made by thousands of heroes. The New Processional Route: Envisioning a Unique Tribute As a concrete avenue to honor the fallen soldiers' bravery and commitment, the Leicester City Council has proposed the creation of a tree-lined processional route leading up to the Arch of Remembrance. This enchanting path will add an air of serenity and reverence, offering visitors a unique opportunity to solemnly appreciate the gravity of the sacrifices made by countless servicemen and women. The council's vision is to create a majestic avenue with trees planted on either side, forming a canopy of greenery guiding visitors towards the war memorial. Each tree is expected to represent the lives that were lost in the line of duty, immortalizing their memory. This processional route, adorned with aesthetically pleasing and ecologically beneficial trees, would inevitably become a crucial element in the park's landscape. Impact on Victoria Park and the Community The introduction of a tree-lined processional route to the war memorial will not only pay homage to the fallen heroes but also generate numerous benefits for the park and the local community. As an environmental asset, the trees will help improve the park's air quality, while their presence will create a soothing, scenic landscape that encourages residents and visitors to engage with nature. Moreover, the captivating beauty of the avenue instills a sense of pride within the community. The new processional route will also encourage more visitors to come and pay their respects, fostering a greater sense of unity and shared history. Educational programs and guided tours centered around the war memorial and the new route can actively immerse younger generations in understanding the importance of these heroes and the significance of remembering their sacrifices. Conclusion The planned tree-lined processional route leading to the Arch of Remembrance in Victoria Park stands as a testament to Leicester City Council's dedication to ensure that the bravery and sacrifices of the fallen will continue to be remembered and honored. With potential work commencing in 2016, this enchanting pathway will elevate the status of the war memorial and forever serve as a fitting tribute to the heroes who paid the ultimate price for our freedom."},{"question":"Same meaning?

His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \\"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\\" In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. \\"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music,\\" said Jake Hess. \\"The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows.\\" Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons. As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues, and, as Stoller put it, \\"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\\" At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \\"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\\" Guess a valid title for it!

And between one and two hundred thousand people are hurt. There are rules to make the roads safe, but people do not always obey the rules. They are careless. If everybody obeys the rules, the road will be much safer. How can we make the roads safer? Remember this rule. In Great Britain traffic keeps to the left. Cars, buses and bikes must all keep to the left side of the road. In most other countries traffic keeps to the right. Before crossing the road, we should stop and look at both ways. Look right and left. Then, if you are sure that the road is clear, it is safe to cross the road. If you see small children or very old people, help them to cross the road.

Martha grew up in a household that always kept their bread in the freezer so that's what she does with her bread. But I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures. What is an answer for this question: Which woman's bread will grow mold slower? The answer is:","response":"Martha's bread will grow mold slower because she keeps her bread in the freezer. Storing food in colder temperatures, like a freezer, reduces the rate at which food spoils. This is due to the slower chemical reactions at lower temperatures, as explained in the provided background information."},{"question":"Premise: Noble warrior. Hypothesis: He was a strong warrior. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis provided, \\"He was a strong warrior,\\" is a reasonable inference that one could draw from the premise \\"Noble warrior,\\" but it does not encompass the entire scope of the premise. Let's break down the definitions and implications of the individual terms more thoroughly to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Firstly, let's consider the term \\"noble.\\" Noble can be interpreted through two primary lenses: 1. A person's social status, particularly in relation to the nobility or aristocracy. In this sense, a noble person is someone belonging to high society, characterized by good manners, distinguished manners, and often possessing high moral or intellectual qualities. 2. A person's behavior or character, particularly in terms of feeling, acting, or thinking morally or ethically. In this sense, a noble person is someone who consistently acts with honor, integrity, and virtue. In the premise \\"Noble warrior,\\" we're given an understanding that the warrior possesses some combination of these attributes. There's a suggestion of gallantry, righteousness, and perhaps even selflessness in the warrior's disposition. Now, let's consider the term \\"warrior.\\" A warrior is an individual who engages in or has experience in combat or warfare, typically as a soldier or fighter. In a more metaphorical sense, the term \\"warrior\\" can also refer to an individual who bravely and courageously confronts adversity or challenge. The hypothesis, \\"He was a strong warrior,\\" makes a claim about the warrior's abilities in combat or battle. The term \\"strong\\" can suggest: 1. Physically powerful or robust, with an aptitude in athleticism or brute force. A strong warrior might be respected for their raw strength and physical prowess on the battlefield. 2. Exhibiting a quality of mental or emotional fortitude, such as resilience, determination, or courage. A warrior displaying mental strength might be admired for their willpower or persistence in the face of adversity. In examining the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it's clear that there's an overlap between these two ideas. A \\"noble warrior\\" could certainly exhibit qualities of strength on the battlefield as described in the hypothesis. However, the premise goes beyond the qualities of physical or emotional strength to include aspects of moral or ethical character and potentially social status. Therefore, while the hypothesis may be related to the premise, one does not necessarily entail the other. A noble warrior could be a strong warrior, but a strong warrior isn't axiomatically a noble one. Similarly, a noble warrior might be defined less by their combat prowess and more by their adherence to a code of honor or the social standing they possess. In summary, the hypothesis \\"He was a strong warrior\\" is not entirely entailed by the premise \\"Noble warrior.\\" While it's possible that the noble warrior could also be a strong warrior, the hypothesis doesn't address the full breadth of qualities, traits, or social implications associated with the concept of nobility."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I bought this for my 9 year old daughter but I have tried it; the sound is good, it is easy to load music and easy for her to run.

He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

There are 11 players on the team. Their best player has 25 total hits. If the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, how many hits will each player average across the 6 games in total? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"First, we need to determine the total number of hits for the team in the first 5 games: 15 hits per game * 5 games = 75 total hits.

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian? Are we pointing fingers at ourselves? In the end, we are all in the same team. Question: What is probably true about the man's actions?

Options: - found a penny - hurt people - not harmed - harm others - make mistakes Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"A person might be happy about an accident in the following scenarios: 1. Found a penny - If the accident led to finding a penny or something valuable, it could bring joy and a feeling of unexpected fortune. 2. Hurt people - It is important to note that wishing harm upon others is not a healthy or appropriate response; however, sometimes individuals may feel a sense of satisfaction if a person they dislike experiences an accident, especially if no serious harm is done. 3. Not harmed - If a person is involved in an accident but comes out of it unscathed, they may feel grateful and relieved, which could contribute to their happiness. 4. Harm others - Similar to option 2, this is not a morally correct or acceptable reason for happiness. However, some individuals may derive pleasure from seeing others experience harm, often due to unresolved personal issues or a lack of empathy. 5. Make mistakes - People might feel satisfied or amused by accidents that result from their own or others' mistakes, particularly if they serve as reminders of human imperfection or provide a learning opportunity. It's essential to understand that feeling happy about accidents, especially when they involve harm to others, is not a healthy or acceptable behavior, and individuals experiencing such emotions should consider seeking support or self-reflection to understand the underlying causes better."},{"question":"A retired Canadian Mountie admitted in court Thursday to killing his wife over a Ninetendo Wii game bet.

What is the length of the platform in meters? Options: (A) 200 meters (B) 360 meters (C) 420 meters (D) 600 meters (E) Cannot be determined Think first, then make a decision. Some random thoughts:","response":"Let the length of the train be T meters and the length of the platform be P meters. When the train crosses the platform, it travels the combined length of the platform and the train. Therefore, distance = T + P. When the train crosses the man, it only travels the length of the train itself. So, distance = T. We can use the formula distance = speed × time to calculate the lengths. Train crossing the platform (time = 30 seconds): T + P = 72 km/hr × 30/3600 hr Train crossing the man (time = 20 seconds): T = 72 km/hr × 20/3600 hr We need to convert the speed to meters/second for calculations: 72 km/hr × (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 20 m/s Now we can plug this value into both equations: Train crossing the platform: T + P = 20 m/s × 30 s T + P = 600 meters Train crossing the man: T = 20 m/s × 20 s T = 400 meters To find the length of the platform, we can subtract the length of the train from the combined length of the train and the platform: P = 600 m – 400 m = 200 meters So, the length of the platform is 200 meters (Option A)."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Avoid combining multiple procedures. Check if the surgery facility is accredited. Follow all recommendations clearly.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Prioritizing Patient Safety: Key Guidelines for Successful Surgical Outcomes Introduction Surgery is a crucial aspect of the healthcare industry, providing life-changing and life-saving procedures to millions of patients every year. As surgery advances and becomes more complex, it is increasingly important that patients, healthcare providers, and medical facilities prioritize patient safety. Research has shown that following certain guidelines can significantly reduce risks associated with surgery and lead to better outcomes for patients. In this article, we will discuss three key recommendations to ensure patient safety during surgery, namely: avoid combining multiple procedures, check if the surgery facility is accredited, and follow all recommendations clearly. 1. Avoid Combining Multiple Procedures In some cases, patients and surgeons might be tempted to combine several surgical procedures into a single session. The aim is often to save time and resources by addressing multiple concerns at once. However, combining procedures can have serious implications for patient safety. Firstly, combining surgeries can lead to increased operative time. Longer surgeries can put patients at a higher risk of complications like infections, blood clots, and anesthesia-related issues. Secondly, recovery may be more difficult when multiple procedures are performed together. The body has to deal with the stress of healing from multiple surgical sites simultaneously, which can increase pain and complication risks. It may also prolong the healing process, leading to a slower return to normal activities. To ensure patient safety, it is essential for surgeons to carefully evaluate each case individually and determine if combining procedures is genuinely beneficial, or if it might unnecessarily jeopardize the patient’s well-being. 2. Check if the Surgery Facility is Accredited Choosing a surgery facility is a critical decision that can significantly impact patient safety and surgical outcomes. To provide high-quality care, a facility must adhere to strict accreditation standards. Accreditation organizations, such as The Joint Commission and the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF), evaluate surgical facilities based on criteria like infection control practices, equipment maintenance, and qualifications of surgical staff. Selecting an accredited surgery facility can help ensure that patients receive care in a safe and controlled environment, thus reducing the risks associated with surgery. Additionally, it signals that the facility is committed to continuous improvement and maintaining high standards of care. 3. Follow All Recommendations Clearly Both before and after surgery, patients receive recommendations from their healthcare providers to optimize their surgical outcomes. Adhering to these guidelines is critical in ensuring patient safety throughout the surgical process. Preoperative recommendations may include instructions on medications, diet, and exercise to ensure the patient is in the best condition possible for surgery. Postoperative care instructions may cover pain management, wound care, physical therapy, and activity limitations. By thoroughly following these guidelines, patients can minimize the risk of complications and ensure a smoother recovery. Conclusion Surgical procedures are an essential component of modern healthcare, but they come with inherent risks. By prioritizing patient safety through careful consideration of when to combine procedures, selecting accredited surgery facilities, and following medical recommendations, both healthcare professionals and patients can greatly improve the potential for successful surgical outcomes. It is crucial that all stakeholders work together to create a culture of safety and strive for continuous improvement in the provision of surgical care."},{"question":"Information: - Gampopa \\"the man from Gampo\\" or Sönam Rinchen (10791153), also known by the titles Dakpo Lharjé \\"the physician from Dakpo\\" and Daö Zhönnu, \\"Candraprabhakumara\\" established the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. - The Tibetan Empire (\\"Great Tibet\\") existed from the 7th to 9th centuries AD when Tibet was unified as a large and powerful empire, and ruled an area considerably larger than the Tibetan Plateau, stretching to parts of East Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. - The Jonang is one of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, but became much wider known with the help of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, a monk originally trained in the Sakya school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama, who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical. - The Nyingma tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (the other three being the Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug). \\"Nyingma\\" literally means \\"ancient,\\" and is often referred to as Ngangyur (, \\"school of the ancient translations\\" or \\"old school\\") because it is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Old Tibetan in the eighth century. The Tibetan alphabet and grammar was actually created for this endeavour. - The Kagyu, Kagyü, or Kagyud school, also known as the \\"\\"Oral Lineage\\"\\" or \\"Whispered Transmission\\" school, is today regarded as one of six main schools (\\"chos lugs\\") of Himalayan or Tibetan Buddhism, the other five being the Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Gelug and Bon. Along with the Sakya and Gelug schools, the Kagyu tradition is classified as one of the Sarma or \\"New Transmission\\" schools of Vajrayna founded during the second diffusion of Buddhism into Tibet (diffusing the so-called \\"New Tantras\\"). It is a Red Hat sect along with the Nyingma and Sakya. - Classical Tibetan refers to the language of any text written in Tibetic after the Old Tibetan period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day, it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially Sanskrit. The phonology implied by Classical Tibetan orthography is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the grammar varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic. - Bon or Bön is a Tibetan religion, which self-identifies as being distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology. It arose in the eleventh century and established its scriptures mainly from termas and visions by tertöns such as Loden Nyingpo. Though Bon terma contain myths of Bon existing before the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet, \\"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\\" - The Samye Monastery or Samye Gompa (Chinese:) is the first Buddhist monastery built in Tibet. It was probably first constructed between 775-9 CE under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen of Tibet who sought to revitalize Buddhism, which had declined since its introduction by King Songtsän Gampo in the 7th century. The monastery is in Dranang, Lhoka Prefecture. It was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India. - Tibetan Buddhism is the body of Buddhist doctrine and institutions characteristic of Tibet, the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia.

It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattva is the Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in Buddhist art. - Daklha Gampo ( Dwags lha sgam po ) is a Kagyu monastery founded in 1121 CE by Je Gampopa ( 1079 - 1153 ) , the disciple of the famous and much - loved bodhisattva , Jetsun Milarepa ( c. 1052 -- c. 1135 ) It is located in Gyatsa County in the old district of Dakpo in southern Tibet on land sanctified as a geomantic power - place ( ' head of the ogress ' ) by the first Tibetan emperor , Songtsen Gampo ( 605 or 617 ? - 649 ) , and made a repository of terma by Padmasambhava . - In Buddhism, bodhicitta (\\"putixin\\" \\"bodaishin\\" Wylie transliteration: \\"byang chub kyi sems\\" Vietnamese: B- tâm), \\"enlightenment-mind\\", is the mind that strives toward awakening, empathy and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. - Songtsen Gampo (569649?/605649?) was the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and is traditionally credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, influenced by his Nepali and Chinese queens, as well as being the unifier of what were previously several Tibetan kingdoms. He is also regarded as responsible for the creation of Tibetan alphabet and therefore the establishment of Classical Tibetan, the language spoken in his region at the time, as the literary language of Tibet. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - The Tibetan alphabet is an abugida used to write the Tibetic languages such as Tibetan, as well as Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, and sometimes Balti. The printed form of the alphabet is called uchen script while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called umê script. - The Sakya (\\"pale earth\\") school is one of four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the others being the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Gelug. It is one of the Red Hat sects along with the Nyingma and Kagyu. - The Gelug, Gelug-pa, dGe Lugs Pa, dge-lugs-pa or Dgelugspa is the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (13571419), a philosopher and Tibetan religious leader. The first monastery he established was named Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. Allying themselves with the Mongols as a powerful patron, the Gelug emerged as the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century. - In Tibetan Buddhism, the Red Hat sect or Red Hat sects, named for the colour of the monks' hats at formal occasions, includes the three oldest of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, namely: - Buddhism (or ) is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. Buddhism originated in India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages.

Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Trisong Detsän or Trisong Detsen was the son of Me Agtsom and one of the emperors of Tibet. He ruled from 755 until 797 or 804 CE.

The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration.

U.S. women’s coach Jill Ellis and U.S. Soccer general secretary Dan Flynn met with Solo, 35, in Seattle on Wednesday afternoon and gave her the news, which comes with three months of severance pay. She'll be eligible for reinstatement and a new contract on February. The move follows Solo’s comments at the Olympics when she called the Swedish players “cowards” for their defensive style in eliminating the U.S. in the quarterfinals. Solo, who received public criticism from teammate Megan Rapinoe and U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati for her comments, did not apologize for them. “The comments by Hope Solo after the match against Sweden during the 2016 Olympics were unacceptable and do not meet the standard of conduct we require from our national team players,” Gulati said in a press release. “Beyond the athletic arena, and beyond the results, the Olympics celebrate and represent the ideals of fair play and respect. We expect all of our representatives to honor those principles, with no exceptions.” Gulati continued: “Taking into consideration the past incidents involving Hope, as well as the private conversations we’ve had requiring her to conduct herself in a manner befitting a U.S. national team member, U.S. Soccer determined this is the appropriate disciplinary action.” Solo and U.S. women's national team player representative Rich Nichols gave their responses to SI: Hope Solo's response to SI on her suspension. pic.twitter.com/Y5E5KcrECo — Grant Wahl (@GrantWahl) August 25, 2016 SI: Response to Hope Solo suspension from Rich Nichols, executive director, USWNT Players Association pic.twitter.com/ZOPsYgSCk7 — Grant Wahl (@GrantWahl) August 25, 2016 Solo, the most dominant goalkeeper in women’s soccer history, has won one World Cup title and two Olympic gold medals in a U.S. career that has included 202 national team appearances and 102 clean sheets. Both are the most ever internationally for a goalkeeper, male or female. Solo has been involved in controversy as well. At the 2007 World Cup, U.S. coach Greg Ryan benched her for the semifinal against Brazil after she had started every game. Solo lashed out publicly after the U.S.’s 4-0 loss and was shunned by her teammates, but ultimately Ryan lost his job and Solo was welcomed back to the U.S. team under coach Pia Sundhage and won a gold medal in 2008. As coincidence would have it, Solo’s controversial remarks at this Olympics were about Sundhage’s Sweden team. ​ After Solo’s standout performance at the 2011 World Cup, where the U.S. finished second, she became a breakout personality and ended up on Dancing With The Stars. But in 2014 she was accused of a fourth-degree domestic violence offense in an incident involving her nephew and half-sister. That case has yet to be resolved. In early 2015, Solo was suspended for 30 days by U.S. Soccer after she and her husband, Jerramy Stevens, were stopped in a U.S. team van that Stevens was driving in Los Angeles. He was charged with DUI and served three days in jail.

Solo has been suspended... (Associated Press) CHICAGO (AP) — U.S. women's goalkeeper Hope Solo was suspended Wednesday for six months by U.S. Soccer for disparaging comments about Sweden following the Americans' early departure from the Rio Olympics. Solo called the Swedes \\"a bunch of cowards\\" for focusing on defense rather than attacking the three-time defending champion U.S. team. Sweden ousted the U.S. 4-3 on penalty kicks following a 1-1 draw in a quarterfinal match. U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati said Solo's comments were \\"unacceptable and do not meet the standard of conduct we require from our National Team players.\\" \\"Beyond the athletic arena, and beyond the results, the Olympics celebrate and represent the ideals of fair play and respect,\\" Gulati said. \\"We expect all of our representatives to honor those principles, with no exceptions.\\" The 35-year-old Solo, who was previously suspended for 30 days early in 2015 for her conduct, will not be eligible for selection to the national team until February. Solo was a lightning rod during the Olympic tournament, irking fans in Brazil when she posted a photo on social media of herself covered with mosquito netting and armed with insect repellant. Fans booed her mercilessly and hollered \\"Zika!\\" each time she kicked downfield. Then she caused a stir with her \\"cowards\\" comment. Sweden's coach, Pia Sundhage, who led the U.S. team to gold medals in Beijing and London, replied by stating: \\"It's OK to be a coward if you win.\\" Solo has been making headlines throughout her stellar career. Last month, she became the first goalkeeper with 100 international shutouts when the United States defeated South Africa 1-0 at Soldier Field in Chicago. It was also her 150th career win. Solo won her second straight Golden Glove Award for the best goalkeeper at the Women's World Cup a year ago. Over the course of the tournament in Canada, she had five clean sheets and allowed only three goals in seven games. She has vocally advocated for women's rights. Solo was among the U.S. players who filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for wage discrimination, saying the men's national team players have been paid much more than many on the women's team, which for years has outperformed the U.S. men on the international stage. More recently, she has called for better conditions for players in the National Women's Soccer League. She has also been trying to avoid trial on misdemeanor domestic violence charges after a 2014 incident at her sister's home, when the goalkeeper was accused of being intoxicated and assaulting her sister and 17-year-old nephew. Solo said she was a victim in the altercation. Earlier this year, an appeals court in Washington state rejected Solo's request to avoid trial. |||||","response":"US Soccer has terminated goalkeeper Hope Solo's national team contract and banned her for six months following her comments at the Olympics, in which she called the Swedish players \\"cowards\\" for their play style.

Uncontacted tribe: extraordinary aerial footage This film, narrated by Gillian Anderson, shows extraordinary aerial footage of an uncontacted tribe living in the Uncontacted Frontier. The highest concentration of uncontacted tribes on Earth live here, on the borders of Peru, Brazil and Bolivia. ‘ The uncontacted people are like us before we were contacted. They move from place to place, and when they see a white person they flee. But I can assure you that they are there. Salomon Dunu, Matsés ’ On the border of Peru, Brazil and Bolivia lives the highest concentration of uncontacted tribes on Earth. They know no borders, crossing between countries as part of their nomadic routes. They include the Isconahua, Matsigenka, Matsés, Mashco-Piro, Mastanahua, Murunahua (or Chitonahua), Nanti, Sapanawa and Nahua, and many more whose names are unknown. Not much is known about them. But we do know that they have rejected contact, often as a result of horrific violence and diseases brought in by outsiders. Some chose isolation after surviving the rubber boom, in which thousands of Indians were enslaved and killed. Many fled to the deepest parts of the Amazon and have evaded long-term contact ever since. On the very rare occasions when they are seen or encountered, they make it clear they want to be left alone. Sometimes they react aggressively, as a way of defending their territory, or leave signs in the forest warning outsiders to stay away. How they live The Amazon Uncontacted Frontier, a large area on the Peru-Brazil border that is home to the highest concentration of uncontacted tribes in the world. © Survival International These uncontacted tribes are not backward and primitive relics of a remote past. They are our contemporaries and a vitally important part of humankind’s diversity. Almost all are nomads, moving throughout their territories according to the seasons in small, extended family groups. In the rainy season, when water levels are high, those who generally do not use canoes live away from the rivers deep in the rainforest. During the dry season, however, some camp on the beaches and fish and collect turtle eggs. Some live in communal houses and plant crops in forest clearings, while also hunting and fishing.

They hunt animals such as monkeys with long bows and arrows. Outsiders are moving in There are many outsiders who seek to force contact in the Uncontacted Frontier. Missionaries, for example, want to evangelize tribes as they consider them to be primitive. Some academics are calling for uncontacted tribes to be forcibly contacted as they consider their existence to be “not viable in the long term”. Other intruders have shot the Indians, and even massacred whole villages, when engaged in illicit activities such as drug trafficking. Very often, however, contact occurs simply because outsiders want to steal the tribes’ lands and resources. Tribal peoples are the best guardians of the environment and as a result, their lands are resource-rich. The timber from their forests is incredibly profitable. So too is the oil and gas that lies beneath their feet. Isconahua Indians with the missionaries who forced contact © Survival These threats have ripple effects throughout the region as Indians are forced to abandon their gardens and hunting grounds and flee. For example, a group of Sapanawa recently made contact in Brazil after outsiders massacred the majority of their elderly. So many people were killed that they couldn’t bury them all and their corpses were eaten by vultures. Fatal first contact Survival opposes attempts by outsiders to contact uncontacted people. It’s always fatal and initiating contact must be their choice alone. Those who enter uncontacted tribes’ territories deny them that choice. A Tragic First Contact Jorge, a Murunahua man who lost his eye when he was shot by loggers during first contact, recalls the tragedy that followed. Whole populations are being wiped out by diseases like flu and measles to which they have no resistance. The young and elderly are often the first and most likely to die. ‘Before we knew it, we’d all caught pneumonia.’ The Matis of Brazil recall the devastating impact of first contact. First contact with the Matis in the Javari Valley in Brazil ocurred in 1978 and rapidly killed over half of them. They stopped practising their ceremonies and, like many Indians suffering from the trauma of first contact, stopped having children. By 1983 only 87 Matis survived. Today the shattered remnants of the Matis are regrouping but suffer from the impacts of introduced diseases such as malaria and hepatitis. In the early 1980s, exploration by Shell led to contact with the isolated Nahua tribe. Within a few years around 50% of the Nahua had died. To this day, the surviving Nahua suffer from a variety of diseases such as tuberculosis and Hepatitis B, and receive little help from the government. The problems do not stop after contact. Sometimes governments try to forcibly integrate and mainstream indigenous peoples by settling and integrating them. Officials believe that the tribes need “modernizing” but the fact that these societies are not industrialized does not mean they are not already part of the modern world, with just as much right to choose the way in which they live as any other society. The underlying objective, however, is to free up indigenous land so that the resources can be used. Protecting the land All uncontacted tribal peoples face catastrophe unless their land is protected. This means that all of the Uncontacted Frontier region must receive protection. Survival is doing everything it can to secure the uncontacted tribes’ land for them, and to give them the chance to determine their own futures. Several uncontacted reserves, indigenous territories and national parks exist in this region. But this is not enough. More must be created so that all tribal territory is included inside a protected area. And, most importantly, the borders of these areas must be properly policed. For example, the Brazilian government has recognized territories for uncontacted tribes in this region. However, cuts in funding mean that monitoring posts are understaffed and even abandoned which has enabled drug traffickers and loggers to operate on uncontacted land with impunity. Furthermore, oil exploration and roads continue to be approved in the very hearts of these protected lands. Sierra del Divisor: The Watershed Mountains Contacted Matsés living nearby have strongly opposed any oil exploration © Survival A newly created park in Peru has failed to protect the uncontacted people living inside. The Sierra del Divisor region straddles both Peru and Brazil. It is known for its unique landscape and is a stronghold for rare and endangered animals. It is also home to a number of uncontacted tribes, including the Matsés and Isconahua. In 2015, a national park was created on the Peruvian side. But the region continues to be overrun by loggers, drug-traffickers and miners. Despite being a national park, large areas can still be opened up to oil exploration. Any oil exploration is devastating for uncontacted peoples and forces them to run for their lives. Tribal peoples are the best conservationists. Protecting them is therefore the best way to protect the environment, for all humanity. When contact is made When members of a tribe initiate contact, or contact is forced upon them by outsiders, the country’s government has an obligation to react swiftly and decisively to try and reduce the very high risk of loss of life. Expert medical teams must travel to the area immediately and remain in situ on a long-term basis. Care must be taken not to encourage the tribal peoples to become dependent. The boundaries of the uncontacted peoples’ territories should be policed to prevent incursions by unauthorised people. The latter must also be kept away if tribespeople have voluntarily left the borders of their own land. Contact must not be initiated by anyone other than the tribe in question, as nearly all contacts result in loss of life. Mashco-Piro Uncontacted Mashco-Piro Indians on a riverbank near the Manú National Park. 2011. © Jean-Paul Van Belle In 2011, outsiders began to regularly make contact with a group of Mashco-Piro. These outsiders included missionaries and tourists, who gave the Indians objects such as machetes, plantain and clothes. The Peruvian government did not stop these interactions until 2015, after the Mashco-Piro killed a man in a local indigenous community. The government now monitors the tribe to ensure that there is no more violence and to prevent the spread of disease. However, there is minimal medical presence and disaster could strike at any moment. Help Survival All of the Amazon Uncontacted Frontier must be protected if the tribal peoples who live there are to survive. Their territories should never be opened up to outside projects, including oil exploration, deforestation and roads. We’re doing everything we can to secure their land for them, and to give them the chance to determine their own futures. ||||| Survival International, a global indigenous rights group, warned that given the small sizes of the uncontacted Amazon tribes, this latest episode could mean that a significant percentage of a remote ethnic group was wiped out. “If the investigation confirms the reports, it will be yet another genocidal massacre resulting directly from the Brazilian government’s failure to protect isolated tribes — something that is guaranteed in the Constitution,” said Sarah Shenker, a senior campaigner with the rights group. Under Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, funding for indigenous affairs has been slashed. In April, Funai closed five of the 19 bases that it uses to monitor and protect isolated tribes, and reduced staffing at others. The bases are used to prevent invasions by loggers and miners and to communicate with recently contacted tribes. Three of those bases were in the Javari Valley, which is known as the Uncontacted Frontier and is believed to be home to more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth. Approximately 20 of the 103 uncontacted tribes registered in Brazil are in the Valley. “We had problems with previous governments, but not like this,” said Ms. Sotto-Maior, the Funai coordinator. Her agency’s budget this year for the uncontacted tribes department was just two million reais, or about 650,000, down from 7.5 million reais in 2014. “What can I do with two million reais?” she said. President Temer, who is deeply unpopular, has sought support from powerful agricultural, ranching and mining lobbies to push economic changes through Congress and shelter him from a corruption investigation. Last month, the lower house of Congress voted to spare him from standing trial for corruption in the Supreme Court, but only after the president doled out jobs and agreed to a series of concessions, many of which affected longstanding deforestation and land-rights regulations. A decree by Mr. Temer that opened up a large reserve in the Amazon to mining prompted an international outcry. After a judge blocked the decree, the government announced that it would revise its decision, but critics are wary. ||||| Genocide: goldminers “massacre” uncontacted Amazon Indians September 8, 2017 Evidence of an attack? Burnt communal houses of uncontacted Indians, seen in December 2016, could be signs of another massacre in the Uncontacted Frontier. © FUNAI Public prosecutors in Brazil have opened an investigation after reports that illegal goldminers in a remote Amazon river have massacred “more than ten\\" members of an uncontacted tribe. If confirmed, this means up to a fifth of the entire tribe have been wiped out. Two goldminers have been arrested. The killings allegedly took place last month along the River Jandiatuba in western Brazil, but the news only emerged after the goldminers started boasting about the killings, and showing off “trophies” in the nearest town. Agents from Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI, confirmed details of the attack to Survival International. Women and children are believed to be among the dead. FUNAI and the public prosecutor’s office are currently investigating. The area is known as the Uncontacted Frontier, as it contains more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth. Several government teams who had been protecting uncontacted indigenous territories have recently had their funding slashed by the Brazilian government, and have had to close down. Uncontacted Indians in the Brazilian Amazon, filmed from the air in 2010. © G.Miranda/FUNAI/Survival President Temer’s government is fiercely anti-Indian, and has close ties to the country’s powerful and anti-indigenous agribusiness lobby. The territories of two other vulnerable uncontacted tribes – the Kawahiva and Piripkura – have also reportedly been invaded. Both are surrounded by hundreds of ranchers and land invaders. Uncontacted tribes are the most vulnerable peoples on the planet. However, when their rights are respected, they continue to thrive. All uncontacted tribal peoples face catastrophe unless their land is protected. Survival International is doing everything it can to secure their land for them, and to give them the chance to determine their own futures. Survival’s Director Stephen Corry said: “If these reports are confirmed, President Temer and his government bear a heavy responsibility for this genocidal attack. The slashing of FUNAI’s funds has left dozens of uncontacted tribes defenseless against thousands of invaders – goldminers, ranchers and loggers – who are desperate to steal and ransack their lands. All these tribes should have had their lands properly recognized and protected years ago – the government’s open support for those who want to open up indigenous territories is utterly shameful, and is setting indigenous rights in Brazil back decades.\\" ||||| Summary:","response":"In a remote area where the borders of Peru, Brazil and Bolivia meet, there is a large group of uncontacted tribes, known as the Uncontacted Frontier.

They live like our ancient ancestors, living off the land, hunting, and fishing. The tribes often run away when they see outsiders, because sometimes outsiders bring harm to them. Unfortunately, some people want to take their lands and resources, like wood, oil and gas.

My reply is often a brief \\"You have as much time as the president.\\"I usually carry on a bit about there being twenty-four hours in the day for everyone, and suggest that \\"not enough time\\" is not an acceptable explanation of not getting something done. Once in graduate school,I tried to prove to one of my professors by saying that I was working hard.His answer to me was. \\"That's irrelevant .What's important is the quality of your work. \\" Since then I have had time to think carefully about the \\"hard worker\\" dodge ,and I have come to some conclusions--all relevant to the problem of how much time we have. If you analyze the matter, you can identify two parts of the prob1em:There is, of course,the matter of \\"time\\", which we call think of as fixed. Then there is the problem of \\"work\\" during that time. But, as my professor suggested, it's not how hard one works but the quality of the product that's important. That led me to a new idea: the quality of the work.That concept is perhaps best explained by a sign I once saw on the wall in someone s office: \\"Don't work harder. Work smarter.\\" There is a lot of sense in that idea. If you can't get more time,and few of US can,the only solution is to improve the quality of the work.That means thinking of ways to get more out of the same time than we might otherwise get.That should lead us to an analysis of our work habits.Since \\"work\\" for students usually means \\"homework\\", the expression \\"work habits' should be read as \\"study habits\\".

The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity...., can you guess it ?

Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- On June 8, 2009, nearly one year ago, I stood before a judge in North Korea's Supreme Court and was sentenced to 12 years in one of the country's notoriously brutal labor camps, also known as death camps. My legs wobbled in fear, and I grabbed the podium in front of me, fearing I would faint. Three months earlier, I was on assignment for Current TV. I was reporting on the trafficking of North Koreans, most of them women, who escape to neighboring China, where they are used and exploited. Following a local guide we'd hired, my colleague Euna Lee and I did regretfully step foot into North Korean territory for no more than a minute. While they have been able to get more sustenance in","response":"China, the women we interviewed recounted harrowing tales of abuse and deprivation. Little did we know that our fleeting trespass would land us in the same grim fate as many of the people whose stories we set out to share with the world. Over the course of our three-month imprisonment, Euna and I were interrogated daily by North Korean officials. We tried to protect the identities of the people who had helped us, knowing that their lives would be in grave danger if they were discovered. Countless nights, we prayed for a miracle, that the two governments – the United States and North Korea – would find a way to secure our release. During our three months, the North Korean citizens we encountered lived in constant fear of the regime, with its pervasive surveillance and oppressive control. Their daily lives were marked by poverty and lack of basic necessities. My heart ached for them, and I felt a deep sense of responsibility to tell their story when, and if, I ever regained my freedom. After interminable negotiations and diplomatic efforts, we were granted some form of amnesty by the government in Pyongyang, thanks largely to an unprecedented humanitarian mission led by former President Bill Clinton. Upon his arrival, a new sense of hope washed over us, and finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we were released from our nightmare, boarding a plane back to the United States with President Clinton. As we hugged our family and friends upon touching down, I felt the gratitude and relief flooding through me. But that emotion was mixed with the heavy burden that North Koreans still had to bear, their suffering continuing in the shadows. The experience had cemented my determination to fight for their freedom and basic human rights, while giving a voice to the voiceless. Since our return, Euna and I have tirelessly advocated to raise awareness of the plight of the North Korean people. We have spoken at events, written articles, and appeared on television programs to share our experiences and those of the people we met during our captivity. Our story has become a testament to the importance and power of journalism in opening the world's eyes to ongoing injustice and human rights abuses. In the years that followed, I continued my work with renewed vigor, driven by the enduring spirit of those I met as a captive in North Korea. While the shadows still remain over that mysterious nation, my hope is that the stories of its people and their unyielding resilience will someday flood into the light, finally bringing an end to their silent suffering. As I stand now, years later, reflecting on the harrowing journey that started with a single step into North Korean territory, I am reminded of the incredible power of hope and the importance of fighting for the truth and for justice. My time in North Korea may have been an unimaginably difficult experience, but it has also become a constant source of inspiration and motivation as I continue my work, striving to give voice to the voiceless and illuminating the darkest corners of our world."},{"question":"Q: You are provided with an \\"Event\\", \\"Intent\\" and \\"XEmotion\\" (PersonX's reactions for the given \\"Event\\").

The text describes a 'sweet girl' who is extremely happy to see 'us', with 'us' likely referring to the narrator and potentially others. The 'sweet girl' is also mentioned in a context that suggests she has been through some medical procedures recently - she's been shaved in preparation for an ultrasound and has stitches. Despite these circumstances, her happiness at seeing the narrator/people mentioned as 'us' is emphasized. Based on this, the female subject might be so happy to see the narrator because she associates the narrator and/or the others with care, love, or a feeling of safety. The 'sweet girl' is potentially a pet (as per the context), and animals tend to express happiness and excitement when they see their owner or people they associate with positive experiences. The recent medical situation could have caused temporary separation or a change in routine, hence, she could be relieved and happy to see the people she associates with her normal routine or environment.

Kaci Hickox, who told CNN the quarantine was violating her rights, was discharged after testing negative for Ebola. Also on Monday, a 5-year-old boy who recently visited West Africa and has a fever was being tested for the virus in New York. The boy, who was running a temperature, is with his mother at New York's Bellevue Hospital Center, said Dr. Ram Raju, president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., which oversees Bellevue. The boy's test results should be available within 12 hours, and officials are trying to find out whether the child, who returned with his family recently from West Africa, came into contact with anyone who has Ebola, Raju said. Nurse to return to Maine Hickox was put in isolation Friday after returning to New Jersey from a month in Sierra Leone. Her quarantine, part of a days-old policy the governors of New York and New Jersey instituted for all health care workers who've had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, has been criticized widely by health care experts. On Sunday, she spoke by phone with CNN's Candy Crowley and Elizabeth Cohen. \\"This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated,\\" Hickox said. She said she was flummoxed as to how New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has no medical training, could describe her as \\"obviously ill.\\" Hickox will return to Maine, and arrangements for her travel are still being worked out, her attorney, Stephen Hyman, told CNN. \\"Her first priority is to get out of the hospital and back to a normal life,\\" he said. Hyman said there's a \\"legal basis\\" to challenge the quarantine policies in New Jersey and in New York, but the nurse isn't sure she wants to do so. Each state has a different quarantine law, said Steven Gravely, an attorney who helped rewrite Virginia's quarantine law so the state could more easily respond to outbreaks. The U.S. Constitution gives states authority over how to approach health matters, though the federal government has control over what happens concerning public health in airports and shipping ports, Gravely said. Mandatory quarantines -- now what? Last week, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Frieden, said that active 21-day monitoring would begin Monday in the six states where about 70% of air travelers enter the United States from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, hard-hit countries in West Africa. Those states are New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia. The three-week period marks the maximum incubation time for Ebola. State and local officials will maintain daily contact with all travelers from the three affected countries for the entire 21 days after the last possible date of exposure to Ebola virus, Frieden said. Authorities will require travelers to report their temperatures and the presence or absence of Ebola symptoms aside from a fever, he explained, and they will be required to coordinate with public health officials if they intend to travel and to make arrangements to have their temperatures monitored during travel in a manner acceptable to state and local health officials. New York, New Jersey and Illinois say anyone returning from having direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will have to be quarantined for 21 days. Maryland officials will monitor the health of all travelers returning from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, Gov. Martin O'Malley's office said. The effort will build on state and local health departments' outreach and monitoring, according to a statement that explains more about the process. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's office said the quarantine would be a \\"home quarantine.\\" \\"This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,\\" Quinn said. On Friday, Cuomo and Christie announced a mandatory quarantine for people who had been in West Africa and had contact there with people infected with Ebola. Christie said such returning health care workers who are New Jersey residents could be quarantined in their homes as long as they did not have symptoms consistent with Ebola. Christie said Monday that he was glad that Hickox had been released from quarantine. \\"The reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic. If you live in New Jersey, you're quarantined in your home. That's always been the policy. If you live outside the state, and you're symptomatic, we're not letting you go onto public transportation. It makes no common sense. The minute she was no longer symptomatic, she was released.\\" Virginia is implementing an \\"active monitoring program\\" for all returning passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, \\"with a special emphasis on returning health care workers,\\" Virginia governor's spokesman Brian Coy has said. Should health care workers be quarantined? Arguments against the quarantines are that they could deter health care workers from traveling to West Africa to fight Ebola and could greatly hurt their livelihoods. \\"I'm concerned of the disincentive for the health care workers\\" to travel to West Africa, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. \\"If I lose three weeks on my return and don't get to do the work I'm supposed to do ... means this wouldn't be workable for me,\\" said Dr. John Carlson, a pediatric immunologist at Tulane University. Frieden has long argued against travel restrictions, saying they could hurt the global health community's effort to tamp down the West Africa outbreak. \\"It makes it hard to get health workers in, because they can't get out,\\" he has said. An expert who has studied Ebola for more than a decade, Purdue University's David Sanders, told CNN on Monday that he feels the policy on mandatory quarantines in New York and New Jersey are \\"largely political\\" rather than medical fact and that leaders are acting based on the desire to calm a panicked public rather than to do what's most beneficial. Doctors Without Borders was even more direct. \\"Forced quarantine of asymptomatic health workers returning from fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not grounded on scientific evidence and could undermine efforts to curb the epidemic at its source,\\" the group said. Doctor with Ebola at Bellevue Bellevue Hospital Center is also where Ebola-positive New York doctor Craig Spencer, 33, is in isolation. He is in serious but stable condition Monday, according to Raju. Spencer arrived home in the United States on October 17 after spending time in Guinea. Because he'd had contact with Ebola patients, Spencer took pains to limit his interaction with others, but he did go places and spend time with friends. Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, had been under quarantine at Bellevue, but doctors said she did not have the virus and has no symptoms, said Jean Weinberg, the city Health Department spokeswoman. \\"We learned a lot from Dallas,\\" Raju said, referring to all that went wrong in Texas when a Liberian national arrived from West Africa with Ebola and two nurses treating him contracted the virus. How the Ebola virus spreads Ebola and the U.S. military On Sunday, the Pentagon would not say whether it's willing to still send an active-duty military Ebola response team to states ordering mandatory quarantine for Ebola health care workers. The 30-person team finishes training Monday and will then be ready for deployment on 72 hours' notice. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel would have to approve any deployment. On Monday, CNN learned from military officials that Army Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, who's commander of U.S. Army Africa, and about 10 other personnel are now in \\"controlled monitoring\\" in Italy after landing there following a West Africa trip over the weekend. Italian authorities met Williams' plane \\"in full CDC gear,\\" an official said, referring to the type of protective equipment health care workers wear when dealing with Ebola. There is no indication that any team members have the virus. They will be monitored for 21 days at a separate location at a U.S. military installation in Vicenza, Italy, according to military officials. It's not yet clear if family members can visit them. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Elizabeth Cohen, Joshua Berlinger, Joe Sutton, Daniel Burke, Greg Botelho, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Poppy Harlow, Haimy Assefa, Kristina Sgueglia, David Shortell, Barbara Starr and Josh Levs contributed to this report.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Question: \\"What new fire technology astonished Marco Polo when he reached the capital of China?\\" Answer: \\"Candles\\" Is this answer to the question correct? - no - yes","response":"- no The answer is incorrect because the text states that Marco Polo was astonished by the Chinese using black stones dug out of mountains as fuel, which refers to coal.

The answer will fill in the blank or will complete the unfinished question. Your task is to provide an explanation based on the given question or fill-in-the-blank statement, and answer. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: Eric removed branching isomers from one solution, and left the other solution alone. The removed isomer solution now has a _____ boiling point. Answer: higher Student:","response":"To understand the answer to this question, we need to know what branching isomers are, and how their physical properties relate to their structure. Isomers are two or more compounds with the same formula but a different arrangement of atoms in the molecule and different properties. Branching isomers are variations of an organic molecule where the carbon atoms are arranged differently along the backbone. In this problem, Eric takes away the branching isomers from a solution. Branching in isomers decreases the boiling point. The reason for this is because the degree of branching affects the strength of the intermolecular forces in the substance, namely the London dispersion forces (LDF). London dispersion force is a temporary attractive force that results when the electrons in two adjacent atoms occupy positions that make the atoms form temporary dipoles. These forces are stronger in molecules that are able to come closer together, meaning they are based on the shape of the molecule. When there are more branches on the molecules, they can’t fit together and pack as efficiently, leading to more space between the molecules. This means that the London dispersion forces would be weaker, as these forces increase with the closeness of molecules and the surface area interaction. When these forces are weaker, it's easier to break the intermolecular bonds, so the boiling point is lower. So if Eric removes these branching isomers from the solution, the ones left in the solution will all be non-branching (or less branched) isomers. These non-branching isomers can pack more tightly together and interact strongly with one another. This would increase the strength of the London dispersion forces, so more energy (in the form of heat) would be required to break those bonds and make the solution boil. Hence, the boiling point of the solution, from which branching isomers have been removed, will be higher."},{"question":"После регистрации каждый эксперт получает возможность обновлять свой профиль, входя в ED с личным идентификатором учетной записи и паролем.

Take them outside and shake them to remove loose debris. Clap mats together or hit them against a wall or railing to more thoroughly remove dirt, dust, stones, and more. Alternatively, you can use a pressure washer to blast away dirtiness from rubber mats. Turn on the water supply and spray all parts of the mats with water. Rubber mats are usually designed to be durable. Mats that are flimsy, delicate, or that have a finished surface may be damaged by power washers. Power washers may spray water hard enough to blow away the mat. If this happens to you, use a clean, heavy item to weigh the mat down. Remember to clean under the item as well. Add a moderate amount of dish soap to a bucket of warm water. Mix the water until bubbles form. Wet the bristles of a stiff bristle brush with the cleaning solution. Scrub the mats firmly to remove stubborn buildup, spots, and so on. While cleaning, pay close attention to nooks, crannies, and corners. Dirt and debris often collect in these places. Rubber that has a finished surface or is fragile may be damaged by brushes that are too stiff. Clean an out of sight area of the mat with the brush first to determine whether it’ll harm the rubber. Use your hose or power washer to rinse the mats entirely. Look over your mats one more time. Target remaining dirtiness with your scrub brush and cleaning solution. Then rinse away the cleaning solution one more time. Take a dry towel and wipe down your mats to remove water. When the mats are dry, return them to your car. If you don’t have a suitable towel available, air dry your mats. Refrain from drying your mats in the sun, as this can cause the rubber to weaken.

How to treat your cat's dental problems Give your cat oral hygiene products. These help decrease the amount of bacteria in the mouth and are useful as part of a dental care regime, especially for cats prone to gum infections or bad breath. An example of such a product is hexarinse.","response":"There are several steps you can take to maintain your cat's oral health and treat dental problems. Here's a comprehensive guide: 1. Regular dental check-ups: Schedule dental check-ups with your veterinarian at least once a year to evaluate your cat's oral health. The vet can identify any issues, such as tartar build-up, gum disease, or tooth decay, before they become severe. 2. Brush your cat's teeth regularly: Establish a routine for brushing your cat's teeth using a pet-friendly toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush. Start this process when your cat is young and desensitize them to the toothbrush. Aim to brush their teeth at least two to three times per week. 3. Use dental chews and toys: Dental chews and toys designed specifically for cats can help control plaque and tartar build-up. These products can be an excellent supplement to brushing. Be sure to choose chews and toys that are appropriate for your cat's size and chewing habits. 4. Provide a balanced diet: A well-balanced diet is essential for overall health, including oral health. High-quality dry food can help remove plaque from your cat's teeth and stimulate the gums. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations on the best type of food for your cat's specific needs. 5. Consider dental cleanings: Sometimes, despite our best efforts, cats develop dental issues that require professional cleanings. If your veterinarian recommends a dental cleaning, this procedure involves scaling to remove plaque and tartar, as well as polishing the teeth. General anesthesia is often used, so discuss the risks and benefits with your veterinarian. 6. Utilize oral gels and water additives: Oral gels and water additives can help reduce plaque and bacteria in your cat's mouth. These products can easily be incorporated into your cat's daily routine and typically contain ingredients such as chlorhexidine, an antiseptic that helps kill bacteria. 7. Be vigilant for signs of dental problems: Get familiar with common signs of dental issues in cats, so you can take action quickly. Things to watch for include bad breath, difficulty eating, pawing at the mouth, salivating, visible tartar or plaque build-up, red or inflamed gums, bleeding, and loose or missing teeth. 8. Address underlying health issues: Dental problems can sometimes be connected to other, underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease. If your cat is experiencing dental issues and has another health condition, discuss your concerns with your veterinarian to ensure appropriate treatment. 9. Establish a long-term dental care routine: It's essential to create a long-lasting dental care routine for your cat. Establish healthy habits when your cat is young, and be consistent in maintaining them to ensure your cat's optimal dental health throughout their life. Following these steps will enable you to effectively treat and prevent dental problems in your cat. Oral hygiene is a crucial aspect of pet care, and ensuring your cat's dental health helps prevent more severe health issues down the line.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste. After reading the above, is \\"Via the esophagus all the way to the large intestine\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How is food digested?\\"? Select from the following. [1]. no; [2]. yes;","response":"Imagine you are eating your favorite food. You take a bite and chew it with your teeth. This is where digestion begins! Your mouth helps break down the food into smaller pieces. When you swallow, the food goes down a tube called the esophagus. It's like a slide for your food! Now, the food reaches a sack called the stomach. Your stomach helps mush the food even more and adds some special stuff to help break it down. This is called chemical digestion. The food then goes into a long wiggly tube called the small intestine. Here, the food gets broken down even more so that your body can use the good parts, like vitamins and energy. We call this \\"absorbing nutrients.\\" Next, the food moves to the large intestine. This is like a big sponge that soaks up water. Finally, whatever your body doesn’t need from the food comes out as waste when you go to the bathroom. So, is it correct to say food is digested \\"via the esophagus all the way to the large intestine\\"? The answer is [2]. yes. Because it shows how food travels through your body and gets broken down by different parts to give you energy and help you grow."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A man with a mallet about to hit a target to make a bell ring at a carnival.\\" can we conclude that \\"A man sitting on a park bench.\\"?

The premise refers to the pieces that have a person, while the hypothesis refers to the parts that don't have that person. Step 3: Check for entailment To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must examine if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis. If the premise states that there are pieces that have a specific person, and the hypothesis states there are parts that don't have that person, we can see that the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. For example, it is possible for all the pieces to have that person, which would make the premise true, but there would be no parts without that person, making the hypothesis false. Step 4: Conclusion The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The truth of the premise does not necessarily lead to the truth of the hypothesis."},{"question":"After the assassination of Uthman in 656, Ali, a member of the Quraysh tribe and the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, was elected as the caliph.

Its standout dish is undoubtedly bibimbap, a traditional Korean meal that tempts the palate of many customers. The significant location of Bibimbap House contributes significantly to its attraction for customers - it provides an incredibly aesthetic urban side view of the river. Additionally, its close proximity to another popular restaurant, The Rice Boat, suggests not only convenience for customers who prefer Asian cuisine and who want to try different food under the same roof, but also intense competition, as they both possibly have overlapping potential customers. It would be interesting to note which restaurant foodies prefer and why. Moreover, highlighted by the term 'Japanese Food', we can assume that Bibimbap House offers a fusion of Korean and Japanese dishes, although bibimbap is originally a Korean dish. This signifies that Bibimbap House is attempting to cater to a diverse range of customer tastes and preferences, thereby broadening its market. All in all, based on the data provided, Bibimbap House is a strategically placed restaurant catering to lovers of Asian cuisine, particularly those who enjoy a fusion of Korean and Japanese food.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing. We dated another month or two while we were both there. I was so clueless as to how she felt and it took FAR too long to figure out what was happening.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Are Return to Never Land and Fun and Fancy Free both live-action animated features? Answer:","response":"Return to Never Land and Fun and Fancy Free are both considered animated features, but only one of them contains a combination of live-action and animation. Let's examine each film individually to understand their classification. Return to Never Land (2002) is an animated fantasy film produced by DisneyToon Studios in Sydney, Australia, and Disney Television Animation. It is a sequel to the Disney 1953 classic, Peter Pan. The film follows the story of Wendy's daughter, Jane, who is whisked away to Never Land by Captain Hook and meets Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. Return to Never Land is entirely animated, with no live-action components. As a result, it is not classified as a live-action animated feature. Fun and Fancy Free (1947) is an American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions. It contains two different segments, \\"Bongo,\\" narrated by Dinah Shore, and \\"Mickey and the Beanstalk,\\" narrated by Edgar Bergen alongside his puppets Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd. Fun and Fancy Free combines live-action and animated elements as the latter segment starts and ends with live-action scenes featuring human actors Edgar Bergen, Luana Patten, and the two puppets. The story of Mickey and the Beanstalk is told through animation, but the live-action sequences play a significant role in moving the plot forward. Given the incorporation of both live-action and animation within the film, Fun and Fancy Free is considered to be a live-action animated feature. In conclusion, while both Return to Never Land and Fun and Fancy Free are animated features produced by Disney, only Fun and Fancy Free is classified as a live-action animated feature due to the mixture of live-action and animated elements present in the film. Return to Never Land remains entirely animated, with no live-action components."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"When not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual Urbi et Orbi papal blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre (so called mitra simplex).\\", answer the following question.

You could see a sloth in bad dreams that only exists in your head. The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Can a sloth appear in a person's bad dream? Answer: Yes, a sloth can appear in a person's bad dream. Dreams, including bad ones, are highly subjective experiences that originate from a person's subconscious mind. A person's experiences, emotions, fears, and thoughts can influence the content of their dreams. Since the mind has the ability to create and depict a wide range of scenarios and characters, it is entirely possible for a sloth to appear in someone's bad dream if their mind conjures that mental imagery. This sloth exists only within the individual's imagination, and the content of one's dream is not visible to others."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: How is Bumbo different from Clover Club Cocktail? A:","response":"Bumbo and Clover Club Cocktail are different primarily in their ingredients and flavor profiles. Bumbo, also known as Bombo or Bumboo, is a rum-based cocktail that usually consists of dark rum, water, sugar, and nutmeg or cinnamon. Its taste is characterized mainly by the sweetness from the sugar, warm spiciness from the nutmeg or cinnamon, and the richness of the dark rum. Bumbo was popular during the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly among pirates and sailors. On the other hand, the Clover Club Cocktail is a classic pre-Prohibition era gin-based cocktail that features gin, lemon juice, raspberry syrup or grenadine, and egg white. The cocktail is shaken with ice to create a frothy texture from the egg white. The Clover Club Cocktail has a fruity and tart flavor profile, with raspberry or grenadine providing a fruity sweetness alongside the citrusy kick from the lemon juice. The gin contributes a juniper-forward, dry character, balancing the overall taste. In summary, Bumbo and Clover Club Cocktail differ primarily in their base spirits (rum vs. gin), flavor profiles (sweet and spiced vs. fruity and tart), and historical contexts (17th-18th century sailors vs. pre-Prohibition era)."},{"question":"Question: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned about the ways of whom?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions, on the basis that there can only be one truth from God, and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements. They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity, and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed. Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain \\"separate from the world.\\" The Witnesses' literature defines the \\"world\\" as \\"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah's approved servants\\" and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan. Witnesses are taught that association with \\"worldly\\" people presents a \\"danger\\" to their faith, and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality.\\" Answer:","response":"Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned about the ways of the people they consider to be part of the \\"world.\\" As mentioned in the context you provided, the \\"world\\" is defined by the Witnesses' literature as \\"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah's approved servants.\\" This means that they are primarily concerned about the ways of those who do not adhere to their specific religious beliefs and practices, as well as the influences of other religions that they believe are not in line with the true teachings of Christianity. Their concern stems from the belief that association with the \\"worldly\\" people poses a significant threat to their faith and spiritual wellbeing. This is because Witnesses believe that the broader world is morally contaminated and under the control of Satan, which can potentially lead to dangerous consequences for their faith. Consequently, they are taught to maintain a separate and distinct way of life from that of the general society, and this includes limiting their social contact with non-Witnesses. Aside from being concerned about non-Witnesses, Jehovah's Witnesses are also cautious about other religious groups that they perceive as competing with their understanding of true Christianity. They reject the idea of participating in interfaith or ecumenical movements that aim at bringing religious groups together under a common cause. This is based on their belief that only their religion abides by the truth that comes from God, and all other religious groups ultimately fail to meet the divine requirements needed for salvation. Furthermore, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God's judgment is fast approaching, and that anyone who is not part of their religion will perish in Armageddon – the prophesied destruction of the present world systems. This belief reinforces the need to dissociate from the \\"worldly\\" way of living and other religious influences, as they are considered to be on the wrong side of God's coming judgment. Overall, the concern of Jehovah's Witnesses revolves around the ways of people who are not part of their religious community, as well as the influences of other faith traditions that they deem false or misleading. This concern is anchored in their commitment to maintain their distinct beliefs and way of life, which they believe would ensure their salvation in the face of God's imminent judgment. To safeguard their faith and protect their community from moral contamination, Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to minimize social contact with non-members and remain separate from the wider world."},{"question":"Problem: Solve 9*r + 29*r + 480 = -10*r for r.

The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the Baghdad Railway which was planned to connect the Ottoman Empire cities of Konya and Baghdad with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War. Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The Balkan Wars were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.

Although people usually know what the word means,it sometimes has no exact translation.It's not surprising,because the idea of home is different from country to country,and from person to person.A home is more than a roof and four walls.It's the cooking,eating,talking,playing and sleeping that go on inside.And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed. Homes look different in different countries.They also have different things inside.For example,in cold northern Europe,there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it.In the south,where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out,there are small windows and cool stone floors.

If you do, seek a way to make this dream come true for you.\\" from English to Spanish. Here are the steps I am taking: 1. Identifying the English sentence elements and understanding the context of the sentence. The subject here is the person who may feel called to the desert life and the verb is \\"do you feel\\". The corresponding object is \\"the desert life\\". 2. Translating from English to Spanish considering semantic and cultural nuances to ensure the translation makes sense and maintains the original meaning: \\"Do you feel called to the desert life?\\" => \\"¿Te sientes llamado a la vida en el desierto?\\" \\"If you do, seek a way to make this dream come true for you.\\" => \\"Si lo haces, busca una manera de hacer realidad este sueño para ti.\\" So, the entire translated sentence is: \\"¿Te sientes llamado a la vida en el desierto?

In Spanish, it is also typical to use the definite article \\"el\\" before \\"desierto\\" even though there is no article before \\"desert life\\" in English. The phrase \\"if you do\\" could be translated as \\"si es así\\", but \\"si lo haces\\", more directly translated as \\"if you do it\\", is a commonly used equivalent. \\"This dream come true\\" is a fixed expression in the English language.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's first consider how being on a diet might affect the pancreas' functioning and then assess whether this has any direct or indirect effects on the process. Step 1: Understand the pancreas' role in digestion. The exocrine pancreas cells produce digestive juices that are crucial for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. These digestive juices then flow into the small intestine through an excretory duct. Additionally, the pancreas releases insulin and glucagon, hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. Step 2: Determine how a diet might affect pancreatic functioning. Being on a diet usually involves modifying food intake, either by reducing caloric intake or altering the type of nutrients consumed. This can affect the pancreas' functioning in several ways: a. A reduced intake of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates may decrease the amount of digestive enzymes required for their breakdown. This could result in fewer enzymes being secreted by the pancreas. b. Changes in blood sugar levels from a modified diet may alter the pancreatic release of insulin and glucagon hormones. Step 3: Assess direct and indirect effects of the dietary change on the pancreas. a. Reduced demand for digestive enzymes: As the diet affects the type and amount of nutrients consumed, it has a direct effect on the exocrine pancreas' production of digestive enzymes. A lower demand for enzymes could cause the pancreas to work more softly. b. Altered release of insulin and glucagon: Changes in blood sugar levels could cause indirect effects on the pancreas. For instance, a diet resulting in lower blood sugar levels might prompt the pancreas to release more glucagon and less insulin to help maintain proper blood sugar balance. In conclusion, being on a diet can have both direct and indirect effects on the pancreas' functioning, potentially causing it to work more softly due to reduced demand for digestive enzymes and altered regulation of blood sugar levels."},{"question":"Premise: It was having to ask any kind of favor from this man.

However, there is no clear indicator of the man's behavior or response to granting favors. Hypothesis: This man was not likely to grant many favors. This statement suggests that the man in question has a predisposition towards denying or rarely granting favors. This hypothesis makes a claim about the man's general tendencies regarding favors. Entailment is a logical relationship between statements wherein if the premises are true, the conclusion (or hypothesis) must also be true. In this case, we must determine if the given premise entails or necessitates the truth of the hypothesis. Analyzing the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it can be inferred that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise implies an unwillingness or apprehension in asking for a favor from the man but does not directly address the man's likelihood of granting favors. There could be various reasons for this reluctance, such as the speaker's own insecurities, fear of rejection, or previous experiences. However, these reasons are not explicitly mentioned in the premise. The man may or may not be likely to grant favors, as it is not directly concluded from the premise.

What is this text about?","response":"This text is about professional baseball and specifically, about an individual named Jim Riggleman. As the context suggests, Jim Riggleman is a highly regarded figure within the sport due to his roles in various capacities, most prominent of which include his roles as the bench coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers and as the manager for the Chicago Cubs. Starting off with the current status, the text alerts us that Jim Riggleman is presently serving as the bench coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bench coach, in baseball, typically refers to a team's secondary coach who assists the manager in making strategic decisions and also steps in as the manager in case of his absence. Moving to the historical aspect, the text mentions that prior to his involvement with the Dodgers, Riggleman had a five-year tenure as manager of the Chicago Cubs. The Manager in baseball is a significant role, essentially in charge of team strategy and responsible for making crucial, often on-the-fly decisions during games. This often includes pitching changes, tactical shifts in defense, and lineup changes based on match-ups. Managers are also responsible for maintaining team discipline and harmony. However, the most dramatic piece of information lies in his exit from Cubs, where it's stated that he was fired in 1999. Although the text does not delve into the reasons behind this, it introduces a certain element of intrigue. This could have been due to a variety of reasons usually related to the performance of the team. Traditionally, the manager is held considerably accountable for how the team performs, due to his vital role in strategizing. Therefore, the text captures Jim Riggleman's role and journey in the baseball industry. Besides, it subtly brings to attention the constant challenge of maintaining professional stability within sports, where one's position is invariably linked with the ever-fluctuating fortunes of the team. The text hence reflects the high-pressure environment of sports where past successes may hold little bearing if not followed up with consistent performance."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? the relationships were wonderful Available options: [A]. negative; [B]. positive;","response":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"the relationships were wonderful\\" can be identified as [B].

Since the sentiment of a sentence is primarily determined by the adjectives, adverbs, and other descriptive words used within it, we can conclude that the sentiment of this particular sentence is positive. This is because 'wonderful' is a positive adjective, and it is used to express great satisfaction or pleasure about the relationships being mentioned. Moreover, the sentence doesn't involve any negative words, and the overall tone appears to be expressing a positive outlook on the relationships.

Nibelungenlied, also known as \\"The Song of the Nibelungs,\\" tells the heroic and tragic story of legendary characters, including Siegfried, Brunhilde, and Kriemhild. It was created around 1200 AD and serves as an essential part of Germanic folklore. The story revolves around the heroic deeds of Siegfried, a noble dragon-slayer, and his wife, Kriemhild. After Siegfried's death, Kriemhild vows revenge upon the individuals responsible, eventually leading to a catastrophic end. The characters in this story were often seen as embodiments of chivalry and bravery. The Nibelungenlied has been praised for its literary importance, with its various adaptations drawing upon its original themes and motifs. In Finnish folklore, there are several comparable stories, such as the national epic, the \\"Kalevala.\\" Similarly, \\"Kalevala\\" is a compilation of Finnish and Karelian poetry, showcasing heroic figures who embark on adventures filled with love, loss, and magic.

Jessica was fatter than Rebecca because Choose your answer from: [A]. Jessica ate chocolate almost every day as a snack. [B]. Rebecca ate chocolate almost every day as a snack.","response":"[A]. Jessica ate chocolate almost every day as a snack. Jessica was fatter than Rebecca because she ate chocolate almost every day as a snack. She was addicted to the indulgent, sweet delicacy that came in different forms, whether it be a milky bar, dark confectionery, or beautifully decorated truffles. Her chocolate consumption became a consistent part of her lifestyle. Every day, without fail, her hands would automatically find themselves opening the fridge, retrieving her favourite chocolate before feeling the smooth, melty treat dissolve in her mouth while a wave of satisfaction washed over her. Her day would not feel complete without indulging in this little pleasure. This everyday snack, instead of fruits or nuts that were more healthy alternatives, contributed significantly to her weight gain, resulting in her being more voluptuous than Rebecca. On the other hand, Rebecca had a far more disciplined dietary regime. Her view of chocolate was entirely different, she considered it an occasional treat rather than an everyday snack. She opted for more nutritious choices such as almonds, berries, yogurt and made sure she balanced her calorie intake with regular physical activity. Rebecca was not averse to chocolates, but she clearly understood the importance of moderation in diet. Her sense of control over her sweet cravings ensured that she maintained a healthier, leaner physique than Jessica. Also, the fat built up in Jessica's body not just because of the excess calories but also because of the high sugar content, which would turn into stored fats when the body failed to burn it as immediate energy. The routine consumption of chocolate, devoid of the requisite physical activity, escalated her weight significantly, widening the difference between her and Rebecca. In contrast, Rebecca's lifestyle choices of staying active and eating balanced meals regularly helped her maintain her body mass and stay leaner. Her conscious decision to consume chocolate sporadically, balanced with her fitness routine, formulated the elemental difference between her physique and that of Jessica's. This difference in lifestyle choices, especially regarding their consumption or non-consumption of chocolate as a daily snack, played a massive role in their respective body weights. Jessica's unbridled love for chocolate, coupled with a lack of compensating physical activity, led to her weight gain, making her noticeably fatter than Rebecca, who practiced calculated indulgence and a balanced, health-conscious lifestyle."},{"question":"- heightweight is 183 ; kg & nbsp ; cm / 93 & nbsp - clubs is fitzroy - position is half forward flank - years is 1913 -- 17 , 1920 - statsend is 1920 - originalteam is north fremantle - death date is 11 april 1980 - birth date is 23 july 1886 - fullname is james toohey , sr. .

With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group.

Neff first meets the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) during a routine house call to remind her husband (Tom Powers) that his automobile insurance policy is up for renewal. They flirt, until Phyllis asks how she could take out an accident policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. However, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the \\"double indemnity\\" clause and pay out twice the policy's face value.

The duo consists of Svein Berge and Torbjorn Brundtland. Royksopp is the Norwegian word for the class of mushrooms known as puffballs, the band's name substitutes o in place of o. Berge and Brundtland were introduced to each other through a mutual friend in Tromso, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. After leaving Telle, the band signed with British label Wall of Sound and released Melody A.M., which became certified platinum in the band's native Norway and sold over a million copies worldwide. The album peaked at number one in Norway, and produced the UK Top 40 singles \\"Eple\\", \\"Poor Leno\\", and \\"Remind Me\\". A final single, \\"Sparks\\", was also released. Eple (IPA: ['epl@]) - meaning \\"apple\\" in Norwegian - was licensed by Apple Inc. for use as the welcome music to the company's Mac OS X Panther operating system, playing the first time a user booted a new Apple-brand computer. The band's popularity was boosted by several graphically experimental music videos, many of which were put into heavy rotation by MTV. The music video for \\"Remind Me\\", featuring an infographic-style video by French company H5, won the 2002 MTV Europe Music Award for best music video. In this same event the duo was nominated in three more categories: \\"Best Nordic Act\\", \\"Best New Artist\\" and \\"Best Dance Act\\". The duo performed the song \\"Poor Leno\\" at the event. One year later they received a nomination for \\"Best Group\\" at the Brit Awards.

Choices: - oxygen - hydrogen - carbon - nitrogen A: Answer:","response":"Each nitrogenous base in a DNA molecule is constructed from one or two heterocyclic rings. These rings are called \\"heterocyclic\\" because they are composed of more than one kind of atom. Specifically, they contain carbon, nitrogen, and to a lesser extent, oxygen. Let's discuss each element in some detail: 1. Carbon (C): Carbon is a principal element in organic chemistry and is found in all nucleotides, including those of DNA. In the context of nitrogenous bases, carbon atoms form part of the backbone of the aromatic heterocyclic rings, aiding in the stability and shape of these bases. 2. Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen is an integral part of nitrogenous bases (as the name suggests). Nitrogen atoms in these bases can act as a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor, allowing them to pair with other nitrogenous bases to form the double helix structure of DNA. In the heterocyclic rings, nitrogen often forms multiple bonds, which contribute to the ring's stability. 3. Oxygen (O): Oxygen does not form a part of all nitrogenous bases. Only in some cases, such as in the pyrimidine cytosine and the purine guanine, it is present. Like nitrogen, oxygen within these molecules can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, playing a key role in the proper pairing of DNA strands. 4. Hydrogen (H): Hydrogen atoms are attached to the heterocyclic rings of nitrogenous bases. Although they are not part of the ring structure themselves, they are essential as they form hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, holding the two strands of the DNA helix together. Hydrogen is also important for the overall structure and stability of the nitrogenous bases. So, to answer the question: each nitrogenous base has one or two rings that include carbon and nitrogen. Depending on the specific type of base, oxygen might also be a component of these rings. Hydrogen, while integral to the molecular structure and function of nitrogenous bases, does not typically form part of the heterocyclic ring structure itself."},{"question":"How is \\"Draft amending budget No 4/2007 (vote)\\" said in Romanian?","response":"In Romanian, the phrase \\"Draft amending budget No 4/2007 (vote)\\" can be translated as \\"Proiect de buget rectificativ nr. 4/2007 (vot)\\". Here's a breakdown of each term: 1. \\"Draft\\" - In this context, the term \\"draft\\" refers to a preliminary or initial version of a document, in this instance, the budget. In Romanian, it's translated as \\"Proiect\\". 2. \\"Amending\\" - This term refers to the act of making changes or modifications to an official document, in this case, the budget. In Romanian, it can be translated as \\"rectificativ\\". 3. \\"Budget\\" - This refers to a financial plan for a defined period, usually a year, which includes revenues, expenses, and other financial operations. The word \\"Budget\\" is translated into Romanian as \\"buget\\". 4. \\"No 4/2007\\" - This is the identifier or reference number of the draft amending budget, indicating that it's the fourth amendment in the year 2007. In Romanian, it's the same - \\"nr. 4/2007\\". 5. \\"Vote\\" - In this context, \\"Vote\\" implies that the draft amending budget has been submitted for voting or approval by a legislative or decision-making body.

It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus \\"Surnia\\" of the family Strigidae, the \\"typical\\" owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the \\"Ninox\\" genus are also called \\"hawk owls\\". - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Barn - owls ( family Tytonidae ) are one of the two families of owls , the other being the true owls or typical owls , Strigidae . They are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart - shaped faces . They have long , strong legs with powerful talons . They also differ from Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet . The barn owls comprise two extant sub-families : the Tytoninae or Tyto owls ( including the common barn owl ) and the Phodilinae or bay - owls . The Sibley - Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order ; here , the barn - owls are a subfamily Tytoninae . This is unsupported by more recent research ( see Cypselomorphae ) , but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved . The barn owls are a wide ranging family , although they are absent from northern North America , Saharan Africa and large areas of Asia . They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests , and from temperate latitudes to the tropics . The majority of the 16 living species of barn owls are poorly known . Some , like the red owl , have barely been seen or studied since their discovery , in contrast to the common barn owl , which is one of the best known owl species in the world . However , some sub-species of the common barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species , but are very poorly known . Five species of barn - owl are threatened , and some island species have gone extinct during the Holocene or earlier ( e.g. Tyto pollens , known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas , and possibly the basis for the mythical Chickcharnie ) . The barn - owls are mostly nocturnal , and generally non-migratory , living in pairs or singly . - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. - The genus Tyto includes all barn owls (family Tytonidae) except for the bay owls (subfamily Phodilinae, genus \\"Phodilus\\") that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. \\"Tyto\\" owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. \\"Tyto\\" owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls. The name \\"tyto ()\\" is onomatopeic Greek for owl. - The burrowing owl (\\"Athene cunicularia\\") is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (\\"Cynomys\\" spp.). Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting. - Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family Accipitridae which are widely distributed and varying greatly in size. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'barn-owl'?

The council pays for adding 14 trash cans to the streets and also pays for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of stores. How many trash cans has the town paid for? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Step 1: Identify the number of trash cans added to the streets. The council paid for adding 14 trash cans to the streets. Step 2: Determine the number of trash cans added to the back of stores. According to the problem, the council paid for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of stores as they added to the streets. So, for the back of stores, they added 2 * 14 = 28 trash cans. Step 3: Calculate the total number of trash cans the town paid for. The total number of trash cans is the sum of trash cans added to the streets and the back of stores. Therefore, the town paid for 14 (on streets) + 28 (back of stores) = 42 trash cans."},{"question":"Answer this question. Who wrote the operas Salome and Elektra?","response":"Richard Strauss, a prominent German composer and conductor, wrote the operas Salome and Elektra. Born on June 11, 1864, in Munich, Germany, Strauss was an influential figure in late-Romantic and early-modern periods of classical music. His significant contributions to the opera world include his unconventional and revolutionary operas that explored the psychological depths and complexities of human emotions and relationships. Salome, Strauss's one-act opera, premiered on December 9, 1905, at the Hofoper in Dresden under the baton of Ernst von Schuch. The libretto, authored by Strauss himself, is based on the German translation of Oscar Wilde's play \\"Salome.\\" It tells the biblical tale of a dangerous obsession that ultimately leads to tragedy, focusing on the character of Salome, the daughter of Herodias. The opera caused a sensation and provoked controversy because of its exploration of topics like lust, power, and brutality at the time. Salome is best known for its iconic \\"Dance of the Seven Veils,\\" a sensual and dramatic scene that has been widely interpreted over the years. Elektra, another one-act opera composed by Strauss, premiered on January 25, 1909, at the Königliches Opernhaus in Dresden. The libretto was written by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, who began a fruitful collaboration with Strauss that spanned several more operas. Based on the ancient Greek tragedy \\"Electra\\" by Sophocles and an adaptation by Hofmannsthal, Elektra is a psychological drama that delves into the themes of vengeance, obsession, and family strife. Set in the aftermath of Agamemnon's murder, the opera follows the relentless pursuit of revenge by Elektra, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, against her mother and her mother's lover, Aegisthus, who are responsible for her father's brutal death. The clash of these characters unravels the dark nature of human relationships and emotions throughout the opera. Both Salome and Elektra are notable for their powerful storylines, striking psychological themes, and a remarkable intensity in the music that portray the emotional turmoil of the characters. Richard Strauss's innovative harmonic and orchestral language in these operas pushed the boundaries of the operatic tradition, leaving a lasting legacy in the world of classical music."},{"question":"leading french companies , including the aerospace giant dassault aviation , on tuesday expressed keen interest in cutting into taiwan 's aviation market and public transportation projects .

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 02:21 EST, 22 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:37 EST, 23 December 2013. Jimmy Fallon hosted the Christmas episode of Saturday Night Live for the second time last night, joined by his personal friend and rapping buddy Justin Timberlake as musical guest. The Christmas special is usually the most star-studded episode of the year and 2013 was no exception with Paul McCartney, Barry Gibb and Madonna all making surprise appearances. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also stopped by the show during his last week in office. Last visit: Outgoing New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was one of the many special guests on the Christmas episode of Saturday Night Live. Seasoned pro: This was the second time that Fallon has hosted the Christmas episode of SNL. Bloomberg said he was looking forward to relaxing at the end of the year when Bill de Blasio takes over. 'I'll be fulfilling a lifelong dream of consuming a small soda on a smoke-free beach,' he said, poking fun at two of his health initiatives. While his ban on large soda drinks was ultimately unsuccessful, Bloomberg recently passed a law which bans electronic cigarettes in the public spaces of restaurants, offices and beaches. He was also able to squeeze in another ban on Styrofoam cups and trays. As usual Bloomberg was questioned about a possible presidential run in 2016, and he joked that was one of the many options he was considering along with ‘naked cowboy’. Video Source NBC SNL. Post-mayor plans: Bloomberg said he looked forward to enjoying a small can of soda on a non-smoking beach once he left office. Bloomberg, who has no job lined up after the mayorship, said he has applied to teach Spanish at a few universities but was told his accent ‘isn’t quite bueno ‘. Later in weekend update, Seth Meyers covered the story of tennis champion Billie Jean King being named by President Obama the recent story of Billie Jean King being named appointed by President Obama to lead the U.S. envoy at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Many have considered the move a jab at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent ban on ‘gay propaganda’. In the skit, Meyers interviews Kate McKinnon as a flambouyant King, who calls herself President Obama’s ‘big gay middle finger’ that’s ‘about to get flipped’. Kate McKinnon played a flamboyant Billie Jean King, ready to take Russia by storm as the head of the U.S. envoy to Russia. Coming out in Russia: President Obama's selection of King for the envoy has been interpreted by many as a critique of Vladimir Putin's recent ban of 'gay propaganda' in the country. King says she’s going to drive her Subaru Outback into Moscow’s Red Square, doing donuts and blasting Melissa Etheridge. Meyers asks if she’s afraid of getting in trouble, since homosexuality has been suppressed under Putin. ‘Get in trouble, I’m from trouble,’ King says, adding that as a 70-year-old lesbian, she only needs a clean canteen and a sweater to survive and she can summon rescued pit bulls. King goes on to mock many of the Winter Olympic sports as inherently homosexual like ice dancing, the biathlon and two-man luge. While the rest of the skits focused on Christmas or Fallon’s many-varried celebrity impressions, one other skit touched on political commentary. Fallon teamed up with Timberlake to reprise one of their popular past sketches, The Barry Gibb Talk show. Fallon plays The BeeGee's easily-angered frontman who hosts a 'no nonsense' political talk show with his silent brother Robin. Their guests this week were Fox anchor Megyn Kelly, played by Cecily Strong, Republican congressman Paul Ryan, played by Taran Killam, and Madonna as herself. The hits: Fallon and Timberlake reprised one of their old sketches, the Barry Gibb Talk Show, in which Fallon plays the easily-angered BeeGees frontman and Timberlake plays quiet brother Robin. The topic of the show was the recent bi-partisan budget deal passed last week which made certain that the government will not shut down again in the next two years. Kelly was the first to state her opinion on the matter, but accidentally made the mistake of speaking over Barry, causing him to jump out of his seat and threaten to 'take a selfie with your skeleton' and post it on Instagram. After colling down, Gibb asks Madonna to shed her opinion on the subject of bi-partisan, and she gives an eloquent statement about putting personal ideologies aside for the greater good. In a rare change of charcter, Gibb agrees, saying Madonna makes a great point. But when Madonna continues to talk, Gibb breaks again saying 'You already answered the question woman'. Outburst: Barry Gibb exploded at Megyn Kelly (played by Cecily Strong) after the Fox host accidentally interrupted him. Barry is about to go into a fully blown rage when Madonna puts in a grill and stares deep into his eyes. Barry calms down, saying Madonna has tamed him like a wild horse. He moves onto Paul Ryan next who offends Barry with a play on words involving the BeeGee brothers names. 'We're not \\"Robin\\" from the taxpayers to \\"Gibb\\" to special interests.,' he said about the bi-partisan deal. 'Did you make a pun on my show?' Barry yells before kicking his legs into the air. He asks Ryan is he thinks he's one of the Wiggles. 'I wasn't born on the Isle of Boy, I was born on the Isle of Man!' as he kicks over a vase of flowers and hands one of the petals to Kelly. As time runs out, Timberlake and Fallon wrap up the skit with an exit song and are joined by real-life Barry Gibb.

During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.\\" Answer:","response":"The Laramide orogeny finished during the succeeding epoch, which is the Eocene epoch, around 50 million years ago."},{"question":"In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text.

Where could you find a laundry room that is only used by a few people? Options: - hospital - basement of apartment building - college - house - hotel","response":"To determine the most plausible option for a laundry room that is only used by a few people, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Hospital: Hospitals typically have laundry services for sanitary purposes, but they are not meant for patients or the general public to use. Moreover, the number of people going in and out of hospitals is high. Therefore, a hospital laundry room is not the best option for this situation. 2. Basement of apartment building: The basement of an apartment building would most likely have a shared laundry facility for its occupants. Thus, it could be used by several people according to the number of apartments in the building. However, if there is a low number of occupants or if the building is small, the usage of the laundry facility could be limited to a few people. 3. College: Colleges commonly provide laundry facilities in student housing or campus dormitories. These facilities tend to be used by a significant number of students, making them not fitting options for a laundry room used by a few people. 4. House: A house typically has a private laundry room that is used by the residents of the house. Depending on the number of residents, a house laundry room could be used by a few people or a family. This option is a good candidate for a laundry room used by few people. 5. Hotel: Hotels generally offer laundry services for their guests. Depending on the size of the hotel and the guest occupancy at a given time, the laundry room or service usage might be limited. However, hotels can accommodate a wide range of guests, which may make it difficult to find a laundry room used by only a few people. Based on the analysis above, a laundry room in a House is the most plausible option for a laundry room that is only used by a few people because it provides a private facility commonly used by the residents of the house or family members, and is not shared with a larger group or the general public."},{"question":"Q: A text is given in Bengali.

Participants would be required to analyze, predict, and possibly manipulate different aspects of the physical environment. Here is a detailed example of such a task: Task: Construct a stable bridge using limited materials Objective: To test a person's understanding of force distribution, weight management, balance, and structural integrity, as well as their creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability to work within specific constraints. Description: In this task, participants are challenged to design and construct a stable bridge using a limited set of provided materials. The bridge must be able to support a certain weight (e.g., 5 kg) and span a specific distance (e.g., 1 meter). Participants would be given a finite amount of time (e.g., 2 hours) to complete the task. Materials: 1. Wooden sticks or popsicle sticks 2. Glue or adhesive tape 3. String or thin wire 4. Scissors or cutting tools 5. Weights for testing (e.g., sandbags, books, or other weighted objects) 6. Measuring tools (e.g., ruler, tape measure) Procedure: 1. Introduction: Provide participants with an overview of the task, explaining the objective of building a stable bridge that can support the given weight and span the specified distance. 2. Set constraints: Clearly define the limitations of the task, such as time, materials available, and the bridge's minimum performance requirements (e.g., weight capacity, span). 3. Provide materials: Distribute the necessary materials for bridge construction to each participant. 4. Design and planning: Allow participants time to analyze the problem, brainstorm possible solutions, and sketch bridge designs. Encourage them to consider factors such as weight distribution, stability, and the properties of the materials they will be using. 5. Construction: Give participants time to build their bridges, employing physical reasoning to select the best design and materials for their solution. 6. Testing: Once the bridges are completed, test each one to determine its weight-bearing capacity, stability, and adherence to the defined constraints. This can be done by gradually adding weights to the bridge until it can no longer support the load or collapses. 7. Evaluation: Assess the participants' bridges against the defined criteria and discuss the successes and failures of the different designs. Highlight how physical reasoning influenced the construction and outcome. This task effectively tests an individual's ability to perform physical reasoning, as it requires them to understand and apply concepts related to force, motion, and energy. Furthermore, it demands problem-solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking in the face of constraints, allowing participants to demonstrate their capacity to analyze and manipulate their physical environment."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: Who is Enoch Samways?

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

According to contemporary pro-Dušan sources, evil advisors turned Uroš III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Dušan of his inheritance. Uroš III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Dušan had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uroš III ordered Dušan to meet him. Dušan feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Dušan marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Uroš III fled, and Dušan captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petrić. On 21 August 1331, Uroš III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Dušan's advisors, he was imprisoned. Dušan was crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. The civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria feared for the danger of Serbia as the situation there had settled, and immediately sought peace with Dušan.

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.

Until recently, I could happily say that I have the body I have always wanted to have. I got there with the help of DBal and, surprisingly, without any side-effects whatsoever.\\" Arriving at the point where one can finally say that they have the desired body is a milestone accomplishment in the fitness journey. This statement seems to be a personal testimony that narrates the individual's journey to attain their ideal body type. The individual mentions their usage of the supplement DBal, a legal alternative to the anabolic steroid Dianabol, which is popularly used among bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts to build muscle and strength rapidly. However, the use of such supplements, especially ones that replicate the functions of anabolic steroids, often come with side-effects that may be harmful in the long run. Some of these can include liver damage, high blood pressure, testicular shrinkage, male pattern baldness, or even serious mood fluctuations. Yet, in this case, the individual claims that they haven't experienced any negative side-effects from using DBal. This indicates that, for them, DBal seems to be working effectively in building their body without causing any harm - an outcome that many fitness enthusiasts would desire. The mention of their 'training days being as long as non-training days' implies that the individual follows a fairly intensive and dedicated training regimen. This would be crucial in allowing them to make sustainable and steady progress in their body transformation journey. The balance between training and non-training days also speaks to the importance of rest in muscle development. When we exercise strenuously, small tears occur in our muscle tissues. Rest days are when these muscles repair and grow stronger. Therefore, a balance between work and rest is crucial for optimal results. In conclusion, the individual's statement is a testament to their dedication to fitness, the efficacy of the supplement DBal (at least in their personal experience), and the importance of balancing training with necessary rest days."},{"question":"Article: Anti-government protests erupted in cities across Brazil Wednesday night. They broke out after recordings of phone taps, between former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and current President Dilma Rousseff, were released by the judge heading an investigation into corruption at Brazil's state's oil company, Petrobas. Photo: Getty Images BRASÍLIA—Former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva accepted a position in President Dilma Rousseff’s cabinet on Wednesday, in a move that could shield him from pending criminal charges, and add his popularity and congressional clout to helping Ms. Rousseff stave off impeachment proceedings. Mr. da Silva, who remains the nation’s most controversial and charismatic political figure despite leaving office six years ago, will be the new chief of staff, succeeding Jaques Wagner. ... ||||| The massive investigation into corruption at Petrobras, the Brazilian energy giant, has targeted its biggest figure so far: Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. News reports said Lula, as he is known, was detained and taken to the Sao Paulo airport for questioning. Brazilian police executed 33 search warrants and 11 arrest warrants on Friday. Two of them were in Sao Bernardo do Campo, in Sao Paulo state, where Lula lives. Police said Lula received illegal kickbacks from the corruption at Petrobras. “Ex-president Lula, besides being party leader, was the one ultimately responsible for the decision on who would be the directors at Petrobras and was one of the main beneficiaries of these crimes,�? a police statement said. “There is evidence that the crimes enriched him and financed electoral campaigns and the treasury of his political group.�? At issue is Operation Car Wash, the investigation into alleged corruption and money laundering at Petrobras, the crown jewel of Brazilian state enterprises. Many of those activities are alleged to have taken place between 2003 and 2010, when Lula was president. Executives at the firm are accused of overcharging for contracts with construction companies, and funneling the difference either to themselves, others, or political parties, including Lula’s Workers Party. The scandal has ensnared some of Brazil’s biggest political and business leaders, raised questions about President Dilma Rousseff, Lula’s chosen successor, and tainted the former president’s legacy as well. Lula is a former trade union leader who improbably ascended to the Brazilian presidency in 2003 and remade his country into a regional economic powerhouse. Rousseff, who as minister of energy from 2003 to 2005 oversaw Petrobras, succeeded Lula in 2010. Lula, who is 70, has previously denied any wrongdoing. Rousseff has denied wrongdoing, as well. Bloomberg adds: “The latest twist in the two-year probe may end the career of Brazil’s most prominent politician in decades and revive a frenzied debate surrounding President Dilma Rousseff’s future.�? ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Dilma Rousseff says she trusts Brazil's democratic institutions The speaker of Brazil's lower house of Congress has opened impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff. The process is based on allegations Ms Rousseff broke the law in managing last year's budget, Eduardo Cunha said. Despite re-election last year, her popularity has slumped amid a corruption scandal involving the state-owned oil giant, Petrobras. \\"I was outraged by the decision,\\" said Ms Rousseff in a televised speech. \\"I haven't committed any wrongful act,\\" she added. Ms Rousseff, who earlier called an emergency cabinet meeting, said she was confident that the impeachment motion would be rejected. Two-thirds of the lower house must approve the process for it to proceed. The governing coalition has a majority in the lower house of Congress. The defeated opposition candidate in last year's presidential election, Senator Aecio Neves, has tweeted that he supports the impeachment request. \\"Everyone in the country must obey the law, especially the president,\\" he wrote. 'Difficult decision' Mr Cunha is himself facing corruption allegations, which he denies. He has been accused of lying about a secret bank account in Switzerland.

Mr Cunha had been threatening to open impeachment proceedings if the governing party did not offer him backing, says the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro. His decision was \\"purely technical\\", he said. \\"It was a difficult decision. I did not become speaker of the Chamber of Deputies aiming to approve impeachment proceedings against the president,\\" said Mr Cunha. The impeachment request had been filed by a distinguished jurist, Helio Bicudo, and some opposition members. The document blames the government for the corruption scandal at Petrobras and says Ms Rousseff violated Brazil's fiscal responsibility laws.

The move shields Lula from possible prosecution by a federal judge investigating a massive corruption scandal named Operation Car Wash. The move sparked protests in several cities by those angry at the decision. But Ms Rousseff said that protecting Lula from prosecution was not the motivation for the appointment. \\"Lula's arrival in my government strengthens it and there are people who don't want it to be stronger.\\" Under Brazilian law, cabinet members can only be tried by the Supreme Court. On 4 March, Lula was briefly detained and questioned over allegations of money laundering connected to Operation Car Wash, a massive investigation into corruption at the state oil giant, Petrobras. He denies the allegations and says they are aimed at preventing him from running for president again in 2018. In a taped telephone conversation released by the judge overseeing the investigation, Ms Rousseff offered to send Lula a copy of his appointment \\"in case of necessity\\" - interpreted by some as meaning in case he needed it to avoid arrest.

Lula: 'Man of the people' Image copyright Reuters ||||| Demonstrators shout slogans from behind a banner that reads in Portuguese: \\"Lula thief,\\" as they call for the impeachment of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff and protest the naming of Lula da Silva as... (Associated Press) RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Tapped phone calls between ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and prominent public figures suggest attempts were made to curry favor for the former leader in his judicial woes, according to the magistrate in charge of the sprawling corruption investigation at Brazil's state-run Petrobras oil company. Judge Sergio Moro released nearly 50 audio recordings Wednesday, hours after President Dilma Rousseff appointed Silva as her chief of staff — a move that critics called an attempt to help shield him from potential detention as part of the corruption probe. In his filing, Moro justified the release by saying democracies \\"demand that the people know what their officials are doing, even when they attempt to act under the cover of shadow.\\" He also stressed there was no indication the attempts to secure favors for Silva bore fruit, but the day's rollercoaster of events seemed to stoke more anger at Silva, Rousseff and the governing Workers' Party. Police used tear gas and stun grenades against an estimated 5,000 anti-government protesters who massed outside Congress late Wednesday. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro also saw protests. In the southern city of Curitiba, where Moro is based, hundreds gathered in front of the court to show support for the magistrate and his \\"Car Wash\\" investigation into a corruption scheme at Petrobras that prosecutors say involved billions in bribes for inflated contracts. On Sunday, an estimated 3 million people turned out for anti-government demonstrations nationwide. Silva's appointment is being widely viewed as a way to shield him from his legal woes because under Brazilian law, only the Supreme Court can authorize the investigation, imprisonment and trial of Cabinet members and legislators. That special judicial status now applies to Silva because his appointment has appeared in a special edition of the government's official gazette. A swearing-in ceremony was set for Thursday morning in Brasilia, the capital. In his filing, which was made public late Wednesday along with nearly 50 recordings, Moro said: \\"I observe that in some dialogues, there is talk apparently of attempting to influence or obtain help from officials in the public prosecutor's office or the magistrate in favor of the ex-president.\\" However, he added, \\"there is no indication inside or outside the dialogues that those mentioned in fact proceeded in an inappropriate manner.\\" \\"From the tenor of the taped conversations, it is clear that the ex-president already knew or at least suspected he was being taped,\\" the judge added. In a twist, recordings made Wednesday appeared to have been made after Moro ordered the tapping stopped. In a statement, police said they requested phone companies halt the taps as soon as they received Moro's order, but it may have taken time for it to be implemented. The police said it was Moro's decision on which recordings to include in the probe. In a statement late Wednesday, the presidential palace called the release of the tapes an \\"affront to the rights and guarantees of the presidency.\\" It said that \\"all the appropriate judicial and administrative measures will be taken to repair the flagrant violation of the law and the constitution committed by the judge behind the leak.\\" An attorney for Silva, Cristiano Zanin Martins, condemned the recordings, saying their release was sparking a \\"social convulsion ... which is not the role of the judiciary.\\" The filing by Moro was the latest twist in a dramatic saga that has drawn comparisons to the country's famous prime-time soap operas, known as \\"novelas\\" to Brazilians. Silva's appointment as Rousseff's chief of state came after days of intense speculation about the move. Speaking at a news conference after the announcement, she vehemently denied Silva accepted the post to delay investigations against him, stressing that Cabinet ministers' special judicial standing does not grant them immunity. \\"It doesn't mean that he will not be investigated,\\" Rousseff said. \\"It's a question of whom he will be investigated by.\\" Rousseff, who herself was chief of staff for Silva in 2005-2010, said she was \\"very happy\\" to have Silva in her government. \\"His joining my government strengthens my government,\\" she said. A dexterous political operator, Silva had been seen as Rousseff's best hope for shoring up support for the administration and its agenda by sealing alliances with key centrist and right-leaning parties in Congress and securing the support of social movements. Silva was also regarded as crucial to fending off the impeachment proceedings against Rousseff over accusations of fiscal mismanagement unrelated to the Petrobras probe. The opposition excoriated his appointment, and analysts said it could dramatically weaken Rousseff. Rousseff had been untouched by the Petrobras turmoil. But the Supreme Court on Tuesday accepted a plea bargain by a former Senate leader for the Workers' Party who alleged Rousseff at least knew about wrongdoing at Petrobras, which she formerly oversaw. Both Rousseff and Silva have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. ||||| Ms. Rousseff is battling to stay in office, with protesters demanding her ouster and lawmakers pursuing impeachment proceedings against her. Demonstrations calling for her to resign flared Wednesday night in cities including Brasília and São Paulo. But the people aspiring to replace Ms. Rousseff are under threat, too. The heads of both houses of Congress are being investigated for their roles in the national oil company scandal. The leader of the opposition Social Democrats is under fire over revelations that his family maintains secret bank accounts in Liechtenstein. Even the low-profile vice president, who has been positioning himself to take over if Ms. Rousseff is impeached, is under scrutiny over allegations that he was involved in an illegal ethanol purchasing scheme. “Brazil has turned into an aspiring banana republic,” said Josias de Souza, a political commentator, pointing to the unusual situation of a sitting president handing over important functions to a besieged mentor. Brazil, he said, is being “governed by a joke.” Prosecutors are trying to have Mr. da Silva arrested in a corruption case that centers on his ties to giant construction companies. But cabinet ministers are among the 700 or so senior officials who enjoy special judicial standing, meaning they can be tried only by Brazil’s highest court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal. Effectively, this prevents nearly all of these figures from going to prison because trials at the court drag on for years. Nearly a third of the 594 members of Congress, including the leaders of the lower house and the Senate, are under scrutiny before the court over claims of violating laws. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Anti-government protests erupted across Brazil as former Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, accepted a position as chief of staff for President Dilma Rousseff.

Now, as Malala Yousufzai lies in a hospital bed in Birmingham, England, the shock and outrage among her countrymen have given way to a new sentiment: What will the government do about this? While the Pakistani news media debate how the country should respond to the attack, thousands of people nationwide have joined in rallies in support of the wounded 14-year-old. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid The shooting has prompted an unusually strong and united reaction of disgust and anger among many Pakistanis, analysts say. \\"There is a groundswell of sympathy for her and also a very strong demand for the Pakistani state to do something about this issue,\\" said Raza Rumi, director of policy and programs at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani research organization. Much of the discontent is directed toward the Pakistani Taliban, the extremist group that has claimed responsibility for the shooting and said it will seek to kill Malala if she recovers from her injuries. \\"This has created a very bad feeling for the Taliban,\\" said Saleem Khan, an executive with a paper manufacturing company in the city of Lahore. Khan said he was \\"crying and weeping\\" after hearing of the attack on Malala, who had defied extremists in the northwestern Swat Valley by insisting on the right of girls to go to school. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, the first woman to hold that job, said Sunday that she thinks the shooting marked a \\"turning point\\" in the ferocity of how Pakistan goes after Taliban offenders and extremist groups. \\"Pakistan, at the diplomatic, political and every level, has been asking ... to take this matter seriously, to not let them (the Taliban) have a safe haven,\\" she said. Meanwhile, police in Birmingham said \\"two well-wishers\\" were stopped when they came to the hospital overnight wanting to see the girl. No arrests were made, contrary to earlier reports from the hospital. Hospital director Dave Rosser said the intruders were \\"probably people being over-curious,\\" but he added that the hospital is taking no chances and that tight security is in place. Standing with Malala: Teen inspires others to fight for education At a rally organized by the powerful MQM political party in Karachi, thousands of people gathered, some waving flags and banners with messages of support for Malala. \\"Our prayers are with you,\\" read one. Another said, \\"Malala -- (an) attack on you is an attack on education and progress.\\" Social activist Saman Jafery said: \\"If Taliban is a mindset, then Malala is a mindset, too. It's a mindset of educated and empowered women.\\" Another of those at the rally, Haider Rizvi, said people \\"don't want the Taliban anymore in Pakistan, and after the Malala incident, it is time for people to stand up.\\" \\"The message is right here ... all these people. They are condemning the act of the Taliban,\\" added student Ashwar Waqi. The Taliban, who operate in northwestern Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan, have fallen foul of Pakistani public opinion in the past, notably in 2009, when a video emerged of the flogging of a teenage girl in the Swat Valley. The video provoked appalled reactions in Pakistan at the time, but \\"the scale of protests for Malala are bigger,\\" said the Jinnah Institute's Rumi. \\"Even the right-wing mainstream media have expressed outrage.\\" The Taliban became increasingly unpopular among Pakistanis in 2009 as the military carried out an offensive against members of the group in northwestern areas. But the military operations failed to root them out altogether, and their continued influence in the region was demonstrated last week by the gun attack on Malala and two other girls as they were being driven home from school. The two other girls were less severely wounded than Malala. Opinion: One girl's courage in the face of Taliban cowardice One of them, Kainat Ahmed, is being treated locally. She said she was so scared after the attack on the bus in which they traveled that she couldn't sleep for two days. The 16-year-old girl is in the 10th grade. But despite the injury to her arm and the terror of the attack, Ahmed said she does not regret studying and hopes to continue. \\"Girls' education here is more important than boys' because boys can have any jobs they want to but girls cannot,\\" she said. \\"I want to tell all the girls to continue their mission to get an education.\\" Interior Minister Rehman Malik, visiting the three girls' school in the town of Mingora on Tuesday, said the name would be changed from \\"Khushal Public School\\" to \\"Malala Public High School.\\" A task force will be established to protect all girls' schools in the region that are under threat of militants, he told reporters. \\"I am not only grieved, the whole nation is grieved,\\" he said. The hunt for those responsible has made \\"considerable progress,\\" Malik added, although he gave few details of the investigation. Authorities have forensic evidence, Malik said. Police Chief Gul Afzal Afridi of the Swat District said that 60 suspects are being detained, interrogated or investigated. \\"We have sufficient evidence to find the culprits,\\" the chief said. \\"Soon we will catch them.\\" Politicians and commentators in Pakistan have slammed the attack. But the condemnation of the Taliban has not been as universal. \\"Everybody was angry that it happened, but not everybody was angry with the Taliban,\\" said Tazeen Javed, an Islamabad-based communications consultant who writes for The Express Tribune newspaper. The cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan, who visited Malala in a hospital in Peshawar last week, has drawn criticism for not condemning the Taliban outright for the attack. Khan \\"showed a lot of concern but couldn't resist bringing in the issue of the drone strikes as a cause for this attack, which was a bit of a deflection,\\" said Rumi, referring to the drone attacks carried out by the United States in northwestern Pakistan that have generated resentment in the country. Certain commentators have also begun to question the official version of events, suggesting that the attack on Malala may be used as a pretext by the government for military action against the Taliban in the restive tribal region of North Waziristan. Gordon Brown: Millions face Malala's fight \\"The Malala incident is the CIA's latest attempt to divide public opinion and incite conflict in Pakistani society,\\" Haider Mehdi, a contributor to the Pakistani daily The Nation, wrote in a column Tuesday. As the controversy about the attack rages in Pakistan, the doctors treating Malala thousands of miles away said they are \\"very pleased\\" with her progress and optimistic that she will make a good recovery. However, she faces reconstructive surgery and there is \\"still a long way to go,\\" said Rosser, of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Her family is not yet in England to be by her bedside, but the Pakistani high commissioner is making arrangements on that front, he said. In the meantime, the 14-year-old appears to be \\"every bit as strong as we had been led to believe,\\" Rosser said, adding that the consultant leading her care \\"is impressed by her resilience and her strength.\\" Reza Sayah reported from Swat Valley and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s.

Unfortunately, I cannot give you an exact premiere date for the new season of 'Roseanne' as it has been cancelled and there is no new season currently in production. To give you a background, 'Roseanne' was a popular American sitcom that originally aired from 1988 to 1997. It was revived in 2018 for its tenth season; however, the show was cancelled shortly thereafter due to a controversial tweet made by its star, Roseanne Barr. Following the cancellation, the show's characters and remaining cast members were brought together for a spin-off series titled 'The Conners.' This series premiered on October 16, 2018, and has continued to air since then, focusing on the lives of the Conner family without Roseanne. Currently, four seasons of 'The Conners' have been aired, with the latest season premiering on September 22, 2021. If you are still interested in following the events of the Conner family, you can watch 'The Conners' on the ABC network or stream it on various online streaming platforms, such as Hulu or the ABC app. Please keep in mind that these details are accurate at the time of my response, and future updates might change the availability or release dates of any associated programming."},{"question":"Translate \\"The high prime rate came down before long, but credit-card rates stayed high.\\" to Czech?","response":"Vysoká úroková sazba prime nakonec klesla, ale úrokové sazby platebních karet zůstaly vysoké."},{"question":"Q: A text is given in Gujarati.

The man tries to hide, to no avail; a well-dressed man who is stronger than he looks confronts him and begins choking him. The resourceful man saves himself by pulling a chock out from under a junked car, which rolls forward and pins his attacker against another car, allowing him to break free. Another well-dressed man (Dick Warlock) gets out of the car, but the pursued man flees across the junkyard on foot to dubious safety.A short distance away, as a storm begins to pass through, a gas station attendant named Walter Jones (Essex Smith) is passing time watching a news report about Stonehenge. The reporter is talking about an unsolved theft from some nine months earlier; someone had stolen a stone weighing several tons from Stonehenge in England and the local police are baffled. The TV cuts to a commercial for Silver Shamrock masks before the storm knocks out the power.

For each row of tomato plants, she is planting 2 rows of cucumbers. She has enough room for 15 rows of plants in total. There is enough space for 8 tomato plants in each row. If each plant produces 3 tomatoes, how many tomatoes will she have in total? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Let's break this problem down step by step: 1. We know that for each row of tomato plants, there are two rows of cucumbers. 2. We have space for 15 rows in total. 3. We need to find out how many rows of tomato plants there are. Let T represent the number of tomato rows and C represent the number of cucumber rows. Since there are two cucumber rows for each tomato row, we can represent the relationship between T and C as: C = 2T Now we can use the fact that there are 15 rows in total: T + C = 15 Substitute the value of C from the first equation into the second equation: T + 2T = 15 Combine the T terms: 3T = 15 Now we solve for T: T = 15 / 3 = 5 So, there are 5 rows of tomato plants. We also know that: 1. There's enough space for 8 tomato plants in each row. 2. Each plant produces 3 tomatoes. Now we multiply the number of tomato rows (5), the number of tomato plants in each row (8), and the number of tomatoes produced by each plant (3) to find the total number of tomatoes: Total tomatoes = 5 rows * 8 plants/row * 3 tomatoes/plant = 120 tomatoes Aubrey will have 120 tomatoes in total."},{"question":"Consider the question.

The choice of words, specifically \\"thinly,\\" suggests that the critic believes the movie's feminist empowerment tale is not adequately developed or perhaps superficial in its approach. While it is clear that the movie is based on feminist themes and empowerment, the critic does not seem to be impressed by the way these concepts are portrayed in the film. This could mean that the movie lacks depth or fails to address important issues related to feminism and women's empowerment in a meaningful way. Additionally, the use of the word \\"thinly\\" may indicate that the movie relies too heavily on clichés or lacks originality in its storytelling. However, keep in mind that this is just a brief statement, and it is essential to read a more comprehensive review to gauge the critic's complete thoughts and feelings about the film. Different aspects of the movie, such as the acting, directing, cinematography, and screenplay, could have varying levels of quality, either contributing to or detracting from the overall impression. In conclusion, based on this short movie review statement, the critic seems to have a negative opinion of the movie's portrayal of feminist empowerment. However, without more context or a detailed review, it is impossible to accurately assess the critic's overall opinion of the film."},{"question":"It was temporarily under the control of the Tibetan empire and Chinese from 650–680 and then under the control of the Umayyads in 710.

Options: - farm land - financial - business man - industrial - city dweller Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"While politicians often mention the small-time farmer in their speeches and discussions, it's essential to look at the reality behind today's farm operations. Among the options you've provided, the answer that best represents today's agricultural landscape is \\"industrial.\\" In recent times, agriculture has significantly shifted from small family-run farms to large-scale industrial farms. Industrial agriculture refers to farming operations that utilize modern techniques, machinery, and technologies to maximize crop output while minimizing labor. These farms are usually owned and controlled by large corporations or agribusinesses. The focus of industrial agriculture is on producing high volumes of crops and livestock, often using genetically modified organisms (GMOs), synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides. Many of these farms operate as monoculture systems, wherein vast tracts of land are dedicated to growing a single crop. While the traditional small-time farmer does still exist, they represent a small portion of the agricultural sector when compared to the dominance of industrial farms. To counterbalance the trend of large-scale industrial farming, there is increasing support for sustainable and organic farming practices, which prioritize long-term environmental preservation, high-quality produce, and animal welfare."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: In any event, above and beyond the negotiations, and as well as keeping events under daily - or monthly - review, the Commission is absolutely convinced that early ratification of the UN Convention is the most effective strategy available to us.","response":"Joka tapauksessa, neuvottelujen yläpuolella ja niiden ulkopuolella sekä pitäen tapahtumia jatkuvassa päivittäisessä - tai kuukausittaisessa - tarkastelussa, komissio on täysin vakuuttunut siitä, että YK:n yleissopimuksen varhainen ratifiointi on tehokkain käytettävissä oleva strategia meille."},{"question":"The Harana is rooted in the Mexican-Spanish tradition and based on the rhythmic patterns of the habanera .

It is \\"based on the rhythmic patterns of the habanera,\\" indicating that habanera rhythms serve as a foundation for the Harana style. 2. \\"The Harana is rooted in the Spanish-Mexican tradition and is based on the rhythmic patterns of the Habanera.\\" Similar to the first sentence, \\"The Harana\\" is the subject in this sentence, and the same two points are made: a. It is \\"rooted in the Spanish-Mexican tradition,\\" conveying the same information as the previous sentence, only with \\"Spanish\\" and \\"Mexican\\" switched in order. The meaning remains the same: the Harana arises from a mixture of Spanish and Mexican cultural elements. b. The Harana \\"is based on the rhythmic patterns of the Habanera,\\" which is identical in meaning to the information provided in the first sentence. In conclusion, the sentences mean the same thing, just with a slight variation in the order of words. Both describe the Harana as a musical tradition that originates from a combination of Mexican and Spanish influences and is grounded in the rhythmic structures of the Habanera."},{"question":"This is a test of commonsense with single/multi-choices.

A bullhorn in his hand, he was, in a sense, the pied piper. \\"If there's anybody out here, that wants the swine flu vaccine, please come over here,\\" he said. And come they did. Outside Fort Lauderdale's main library, a crowd started to build, and soon about a dozen homeless people were rolling up their shirt sleeves -- in the middle of the street -- for the H1N1 vaccination. \\"You stop spreading the germs,\\" Cononie said. \\"Because if a homeless person gets positive for the swine flu, they get sick, they go into a gas station and use the bathroom, transfer those germs to a public bathroom, [then] mom and dad come in with little ones, use that bathroom -- boom. Bingo. Contagious. Swine flu.\\" The volunteers are with the Homeless Voice -- a nonprofit homeless advocacy center that also runs a shelter in Hollywood, Florida. They've hit the streets for about three weeks to vaccinate the homeless population in Broward County. They requested the vaccine through the Florida Department of Health to help part of a population that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls an at risk group. Many homeless people often have untreated medical conditions, and the lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for them to catch the virus. So far, the group has vaccinated about 300 homeless people. \\"Some have high blood pressure, some are alcoholics and are more susceptible to the flu, the seasonal flu, and the swine flu,\\" said Dr. Chad Frank, a family practice physician who is a volunteer. \\"We're protecting them, and we're also saving the emergency rooms here as well from being overloaded with potential patients, swine flu patients.\\" Wearing a yellow reflective T-shirt, Frank spends his nights on the street during the vaccination effort. \\"I think it's needed,\\" he said. \\"And believe it or not, it's fun. That's why I'm a doctor.\\" Russell Ahamed was one of the first people in line. He lives in the park next to the library in downtown Fort Lauderdale.

There's not a whole lot of people that come by and do something like this,\\" Ahamed said. \\"I know people can die from [the flu].\\" But on this night, not everyone was able to get the shot. William -- the only name he gave to volunteers -- was ready and willing but not able. Alcohol had gotten the best of him, and he could no longer stand. Fearing a possible bad reaction to the vaccine, the volunteers would not give it to him. Calmly, Cononie leaned down to talk to William, who was sitting on the grass, and explained why they couldn't vaccinate him then. \\"William, I'm gonna put something in your bag. It's a piece of paper,\\" Cononie said. \\"When you wake up in the morning, promise me you're going to look for this piece of paper, OK? It says our phone number. Call us in the morning.

He's been homeless for three weeks, and he's trying to stay sober. \\"It's tough out here, but it's how you make it,\\" Engels said, rolling up his sleeve to get the vaccine injection. The volunteers said there's no way to know how much of an effect they are having in stopping the spread of H1N1, but they believe they are doing a public service. \\"A true blessing,\\" Engels agreed. \\"You don't have to go to a hospital and pay the bill.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","response":"1.

I found myself sitting in my house constantly worried. I decided to force myself to find some volunteer work to occupy my thoughts. The first place I sought out was the Arizona Humane Society. It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely. I started this wanting to give others help and realized in doing so I was the one who really benefited the most. 1 believe the companionship and peace that comes from working with our animal brothers is something that can and will make the world a better place!

Choices: - particles fuse together - particles range together - particles pipe together - particles closer together A: The answer is:","response":"\\"particles closer together.\\" The speed at which waves travel through a medium is determined by the properties of the medium itself. In the case of solids, liquids, and gases, the different phases of matter, the speed of wave propagation varies greatly. In solid objects, particles are arranged in a tightly bound manner. They're much closer together compared to those in liquids and gases. The proximity of these particles in solids leads to quicker transfer of energy from one particle to the next. Essentially, when a wave (energy) hits the first particle in a solid, it quickly passes the energy on to the next particle because of the close distance, and this continues in a domino effect, allowing the wave to travel at a faster speed. This phenomenon can be easily observed in everyday life. For example, if you knock one end of a solid metal rod, the sound (which is a wave) will reach the other end almost instantaneously. However, if you were to try the same with air or water (knocking one end of a column of air or water), the sound would travel much slower. The incorrect choices hinted at various ways particles might interact ('fuse', 'range', 'pipe'), but these doesn't accurately describe the reasons behind the speed of wave propagation in solids. 'Fusing' suggests a chemical reaction or change of state, neither of which are the reasons for waves traveling faster in solids. 'Ranging together' and 'piping together' do not appropriately represent any principle or mechanism in physics known to increase wave speed. In conclusion, waves travel faster through solids because the particles are closer together. This allows for quicker energy transfer and propagation of the wave through the medium."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What name is Jerry being called? imbecille Answer:","response":"Title: The Chronicles of Imbecille Genre: Comedy-Drama Plot: Act 1: Introducing Jerry In a small, quirky suburban town, Jerry, a kind-hearted and well-intentioned but somewhat socially awkward man, lives with his loving wife, Emma.

A:","response":"The given review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product, and here are the reasons why: 1. Incorrect Product Delivered: The reviewer highlights that they have ordered the product three times and each time, they have received the wrong product (T603 instead of T605). This indicates that the seller might have a consistent issue with their inventory management and delivery process that could affect my order too. 2. Lack of A2DP streaming: The primary reason for the disappointment in the review is the absence of A2DP streaming in the delivered product. A2DP is an important feature for many customers who want to stream high-quality audio wirelessly. If this feature is not available in the product delivered, it would not meet my expectations and requirements, providing less value for the purchase. 3. Questionable Seller Intent: The reviewer suggests that the seller is shipping the wrong product \\"on purpose.\\" This raises concerns about the credibility and integrity of the seller. As a potential buyer, this claim would make me question the overall trustworthiness of the seller and consider looking for alternative products or sellers with more reliable reviews. 4. Return Process: Although the reviewer mentions that the return process was handled promptly, having to go through the hassle of returning a product multiple times is not ideal. It leads to wasted time, effort, and potential frustration, which are factors I would want to avoid when making a purchase. In summary, considering the issues highlighted in the review, including the wrong product being delivered and the lack of a required feature, the review would substantially decrease my chances of buying the product. Additionally, the trustworthiness of the seller is also in question, making it less likely for me to take the risk and proceed with the purchase.

(Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) The male-chauvinist group Proud Boys has been described by federal authorities as an “extremist group with ties to white nationalism” — and has been the subject of warnings to local police agencies by the FBI, according to a report issued by a Washington state sheriff’s office. The report, from the office of Clark County Sheriff Chuck E. Atkins in southwestern Washington, was issued as the office analyzed the dismissal of a deputy who was fired after her affiliation with a female offshoot of the group, Proud Boys' Girls, came to light. “The FBI categorizes the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism,” noted the report, which was acquired and published by Property of the People, a nonprofit focused on government transparency. “The FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses.” The Proud Boys are one of many predominantly male, right-wing groups to come to the fore since President Trump’s election. They describe themselves as a “Western chauvinist” fraternal group that believes in ending welfare, closing the borders and adhering to traditional gender roles. But critics point to other statements and behavior to argue that these aims are a subterfuge for racist and hateful beliefs. “Their disavowals of bigotry are belied by their actions: rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists,” the Southern Poverty Law Center, which considers the Proud Boys a hate group, wrote in a report. “They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.” The group captured national media attention for its involvement in a fight that broke out on the streets of New York after it was invited to a Republican club in town. Police sought to charge nine people who were affiliated with the group after the incident. The Proud Boys, who did not respond to a request for comment sent to their New York chapter, have pushed back on assertions like those made by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Founder Gavin McInnes, who was also a co-founder of Vice, has argued that his ideology is not motivated by racism. “When pestered about their pedagoguery, the politically correct left insists they need to police our language because ‘words are powerful’ and ‘words have meaning,’” he wrote in a 2011 essay. “It is not racist for white people to be unashamed of their race. Few people mind hearing ‘Navajo Power,’ but there’s this implication that for whites to show any kind of pride means they want to extinguish other races. That’s as absurd as saying a Dallas Cowboys fan wants all the other teams to die. To say black people are totally responsible for their lot in life now that it’s 2011 is not racist.\\" The FBI’s field office in Seattle referred inquiries about its designation to its headquarters in Washington. In a statement distributed by spokeswoman Kelsey Pietranton, the FBI said it did not regulate political ideology or any other rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. “Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security,” the statement said. “When it comes to domestic terrorism, our investigations focus solely on criminal activity of individuals — regardless of group membership — which appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion. The FBI does not and will not police ideology.” As is its practice, the bureau declined to deny or confirm whether the group was the subject of an investigation. The author of the Clark County Sheriff’s report, Cmdr. Michael S. McCabe, told the Guardian, which first reported on the documents, that the FBI’s classification was revealed in an FBI briefing in August. As the Guardian reported: The briefing included agency heads from local law enforcement, and in it the FBI said that they “have been warning [local law enforcement] for a while” about the Proud Boys, “not just in Washington, but around the nation.” The briefing including the Proud Boys was delivered by an FBI analyst, according to information forwarded to the Guardian by McCabe. It touched on topics including “How the FBI tracks hate/extremist groups”, “Brief history of these groups in the Pacific NW”, “A description of currently active groups with a focus on the Portland/Vancouver area”, and “Current trends or concerns over law enforcement officers/employees involvement with these groups”. McCabe’s report found that Deputy Erin Willey’s participation with the Proud Boys and the Proud Boys' Girls violated two of the office’s policies, governing off-duty conduct and nondiscrimination and harassment, as well as her oath of office.

The FBI’s 2018 designation of the self-confessed “western chauvinist group” as extremist has not been previously made public. Who are the Proud Boys, 'western chauvinists' involved in political violence? Read more The Proud Boys was founded by the Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes. McInnes has insisted that his group is not white nationalist or “alt-right” but the Proud Boys have a history of misogyny and glorifying violence. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists them as a hate group. The document also says: “The FBI has warned local law enforcement agencies that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific north-west”, and: “Proud Boys members have contributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.” Sign up for the new US morning briefing The report, and the FBI’s warning to south-west Washington police agencies about the Proud Boys’ role in escalating violence at these events came in August, two months before the group was involved in an infamous weekend of street violence in New York City and Portland, and not long after they participated in street violence in downtown Portland on 30 June. The document, provided to the Guardian by the government transparency non-profit Property of the People, was part of an internal affairs investigation into a probationary deputy in the Clark county sheriff’s department. The former clark county deputy, Erin Willey, was fired last July after a photo of her wearing a “Proud Boys Girls” sweatshirt was published by the Vancouver, Washington newspaper the Columbian. The Proud Boys Girls is the female auxiliary of the men-only group founded by McInnes in 2016. The author of the document, headquarters commander Michael McCabe, is in charge of internal affairs, training, background investigation and courthouse security in the Clark county sheriff’s department. After confirming the authenticity of the document, he told the Guardian in a telephone interview that the FBI’s classification of the Proud Boys as an extremist group was revealed to him in “a briefing we were given by the FBI” on 2 August, at Clark county’s west precinct. The briefing included agency heads from local law enforcement, and in it the FBI said that they “have been warning [local law enforcement] for a while” about the Proud Boys, “not just in Washington but around the nation”. The briefing including the Proud Boys was delivered by an FBI analyst, according to information forwarded to the Guardian by McCabe. It touched on topics including “How the FBI tracks hate/extremist groups”, “Brief history of these groups in the Pacific NW”, “A description of currently active groups with a focus on the Portland/Vancouver area”, and “Current trends or concerns over law enforcement officers/employees involvement with these groups”.

Photograph: John Rudoff/Sipa USA/REX/Shutterstock The document says that Willey was an active Proud Boys Girls member between November 2016 and October 2017, and in February 2017 she “actively participated in the manufacturing, advertising and selling of Proud Boys Girls’ merchandise on a website”. The document concludes that membership in the Proud Boys may constitute a violation of the Clark county sheriff’s department oath to support and protect the laws of the United States, since Proud Boys “members have been documented as having called for the closure of all prisons, the issuing of firearms to everyone, the legalization of all drugs, the deportation of all illegal immigrants and the shutdown of the government”. Another concern expressed in the document produced by McCabe – which was handed to the sheriff, Chuck E Atkins, so he could make a decision on Willey’s future in the department – was the possibility that the deputy’s membership in the group would constitute a so-called “Brady violation”. The Brady doctrine requires prosecutors to disclose any potentially exculpatory evidence to defenses in the discovery phase of criminal trials. Membership in the Proud Boys, the document says, may constitute “evidence that a deputy is biased or has some motive to lie” which could constitute a prosecutorial risk. According to the report, Willey was placed on administrative leave after the Columbian contacted the sheriff’s department on 2 July. She was fired on 17 July, before the report was completed, and just before the Columbian published its story. The report also states Willey’s belief that the photo of her in a Proud Boys sweatshirt was given to the Columbian by her former boyfriend, and “active Proud Boy member”, Graham Jorgensen. Jorgensen has been a regular participant in rallies organized by the Clark county-based Patriot Prayer group, whose events have included Proud Boys, and which have frequently culminated in violence. Other law enforcement agencies have discovered Proud Boys in their midst and responded in a similar manner. A month after Willey was fired, Brian Green, a patrol deputy in Louisiana, was also let go after social media posts revealed his allegiance to the group. Willey and Jorgensen could not be reached for comment. In Clark county, Proud Boys have been integral to the Patriot Prayer movement, which organizes rightwing street marches and rallies in Portland, Seattle, Vancouver and other cities in the Pacific north-west. ‘Call me a racist, but don’t say I’m a Buddhist’: America's alt right Read more Asked about the apparent high level of Proud Boy activity and rightwing organizing in Clark county, McCabe said: “I think both as an agency and me, personally, we worry about that. “Anybody who has watched the news recently can see that the United States appears divided. Any time you are dealing with groups who are espousing hate, it’s certainly a concern for law enforcement,” he added. McCabe pointed to a joint statement by Atkins and the Clark county prosecuting attorney Tony Golik in the wake of reporting on Willey’s firing. In that statement, the men said in part: “We reject hate, bigotry, harassment, violence or the inciting of violence, and all actions intended to harm or intimidate others.” The FBI did not directly address the designation or the briefing in response to specific email questions, but did say that while “the FBI does not and will not police ideology”, the agency “regularly assesses intelligence regarding possible threats and works closely to share that information with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners”. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"The Proud Boys, a male-chauvinist group, has been classified as an \\"extremist group with ties to white nationalism\\" by federal authorities, according to a report by a Washington state sheriff's office.

You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: My kids like it, I don't. Product review: We received this as a baby gift a few years ago. It is still in regular use. It's adorable, but I hate that my kids have such a hard time turning it on. The music and lights are activated by these tiny buttons hidden under a felt layer. The felt moves around occasionally, so the button is hard to find. Forget using the ignition key to turn on the music. It took two years for us to realize that the horn actually makes noise. Our son managed to hit the button by mistake. It is virtually impossible to press the button through the stuffed bear on the steering wheel. I would really like this car if I wasn't obligated to sit down and press the button for my kids every fifteen seconds when they want to play with it. In my opinion, if I have to own an electronic noisy toy, it had better occupy my kids while I am in another room where I don't have to listen to it.It does work well as a support for a soon-to-be sitting child, but I personally prefer a boppy pillow. The answer is:","response":"This review would most likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. Although the reviewer mentions some positive aspects of the product such as its durability (it's still in regular use after a few years) and its support for soon-to-be sitting children, the negatives seem to outweigh the positives. The reviewer critically points out design flaws that might affect functionality and user experience. For instance, the music and lights are activated by tiny buttons hidden under a felt layer, making it difficult for kids to turn it on. The keys of the product are also virtually hard to press. These negatives affect the convenience of the product and need for regular adult involvement, which contravenes the purpose of an enjoyable and autonomous kids' toy. Moreover, the reviewer clearly states a personal dislike for the toy due to the constant obligation to assist kids in operating it. Therefore, these negative aspects, as narrated from a user’s perspective, suggest that buying this product might not offer the best value for money or meet expectations for functional convenience."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: car, laugh, pull","response":"The happy little girl couldn't stop laughing as she pulled her toy car along the floor."},{"question":"Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all.

At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hatari! is the story of a group of adventurers in East Africa, engaged in the exciting and lucrative but dangerous business of catching wild animals for delivery to zoos around the world. As \\"Momella Game Ltd.\\", they operate from a compound near the town of Arusha. The head of the group is Sean Mercer (John Wayne); the others are safari veteran Little Wolf a/k/a \\"the Indian\\" (Bruce Cabot); drivers \\"Pockets\\" (Red Buttons), a former Brooklyn taxi driver, and Kurt (Hardy KrÃ¼ger), a German auto racing driver; roper Luis (Valentin de Vargas), a former Mexican former bullfighter, and Brandy (Michele Girardon), a young woman whose late father was a member of the group; she grew up there. Their method (shown in several action sequences) is to chase the selected animal across the plains with a truck, driven by Pockets. Sean stands in the bed of the truck with a rope noose on a long pole, and snags the animal by its head. (For smaller animals, Sean rides in a seat mounted on the truck's left front fender.) A smaller, faster \\"herding car,\\" driven by Kurt, swings outside, driving the animal back toward the \\"catching truck\\". Once the animal is snagged, Luis, an expert roper, catches its legs and secures it. The animal is then moved into a travel crate and carried on a third truck, driven by Brandy. The captured animals are held in pens in the compound, tended by native workers, until they are shipped out at the end of the hunting season. Sometimes the group ranges far outside the compound for several days, accompanied by additional trucks with camp equipment. In the opening sequence, the group chases a rhinoceros, but it attacks the herding car and severely gores the Indian, who has to be transported to the Arusha hospital. While they are waiting to hear about the Indian's condition, a young Frenchman... My question: Where does the story take place?

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"Step 1: Identify the important information in the premise and hypothesis. Premise: Guy (person) drilling near a lamp post. Hypothesis: A person drilling a deep hole near a lamp post. Step 2: Compare the information in the premise and the hypothesis. In the premise, we have a person (guy) drilling near a lamp post. In the hypothesis, we have a person drilling a deep hole near a lamp post. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise tells us that a person is drilling near a lamp post, but it doesn't mention anything about the depth of the hole being drilled. Conclusion: Based on the information given, it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis. The depth of the hole being drilled is not specified in the premise, so we cannot confirm if the hole is deep or not.

Ninety-five people, most of them firefighters, are still missing. Mr Li met those who had been injured and displaced by the blasts. A senior military officer said \\"several hundred\\" tons of the toxic chemical sodium cyanide had been identified at two locations in the blast zone. Of the 721 people injured, 25 are in critical condition and 33 are serious. The premier also met recovery teams and environmental monitors who are trying to secure the site, much of which was flattened by the explosions. An investigation is under way to ascertain what triggered the disaster. Dozens of relatives of the missing and local residents have held a number of angry protests at a hotel used for official news conferences. They say they have not received enough information from the government about what chemicals are at the site. Meanwhile, a number of websites have been shut down for allegedly spreading unverified information about the blasts. The state news agency Xinhua said 50 sites were accused of creating panic by publishing rumours. The chemical sodium cyanide is white crystalline or granular powder which can be rapidly fatal if inhaled or ingested, as it interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen. It is mostly used in chemical manufacturing, for fumigation and in the mining industry to extract gold and silver. It is soluble in water, and absorbs water from air, and its dust is also easy to inhale. When dissolved or burned, it releases the highly poisonous gas hydrogen cyanide. Potent chemical mix behind blasts What we know about explosions The questions being asked by Chinese citizens 'Hero' firefighters hailed 'Like the end of the world': Residents' stories Twenty-four of the victims had been identified by Sunday and experts are carrying out further DNA tests. Troops equipped with chemical warfare protection entered the site of the blasts on Saturday, to deal with a dangerous cocktail of chemicals. Officials had previously confirmed the presence of calcium carbide, potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate. Calcium carbide reacts with water to create the highly explosive acetylene. The toxic chemical sodium cyanide was also discovered in large quantities at the site. Greenpeace said tests in the area showed that water supplies were not severely contaminated with the cyanide, but that did not \\"disprove the presence of other hazardous chemicals\\". The operators of the Tianjin facility have been accused of violating safety procedures. Prosecutors are to set up a team to investigate any possible offenses related to the disaster, including dereliction of duty. The Chinese government has also ordered officials to make nationwide checks on dangerous chemicals and explosives and to \\"crack down unwaveringly on illegal activities to ensure safety\\". Summarize the main points of that article.","response":"A big explosion happened at a place where they keep dangerous chemicals. Many people got hurt and some are still missing. A very bad chemical called sodium cyanide was found there, and it can be very dangerous if we breathe it in or eat it.
