He has a wife named Vickie (Rutanya Alda) and an eight-year-old son named Scott.

As many specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of enormous, greenhouse-like geodesic domes, attached to a large spaceship named \\"Valley Forge\\", forming part of a fleet of American Airlines space freighters, currently just outside the orbit of Saturn. Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist and ecologist who carefully preserves a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. Lowell spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life. The crew receives orders to jettison and destroy the domes (with nuclear charges) and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six domes are jettisoned and blown up Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crew-mates who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of one of the remaining domes, trapping and killing the remaining two crewmen. Enlisting the aid of the ship's three \\"drones\\" (service robots), Huey, Dewey and Louie (named after Donald Duck's nephews), Lowell stages a fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the Valley Forge careening towards Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his leg and sets the Valley Forge on a risky course through Saturn's rings. Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 (Louie) is lost, but the ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other side of the rings. Lowell and the surviving drones, Huey and Dewey, set out into deep space to maintain the forest. Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children., can you guess it ? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the article, Lowell speaks constantly to the ship's three \\"drones\\" - Huey, Dewey, and Louie, as if they are children.

For this task, I will select \\"climate change.\\" Step 2: Develop a specific context Now, I'll create a specific context within the broader topic of climate change. To do this, I'll consider various aspects of the topic and focus on one particular area. For my context, I'll choose: \\"The effects of deforestation on local climates.\\" Step 3: Research the context In order to create a well-informed hypothesis, I'll need to research the chosen context. Researching allows me to understand the key factors and relationships involved in the topic. Upon doing some research, I discover that deforestation can lead to changes in local temperature, rainfall patterns, and humidity levels. Additionally, this can lead to alterations in ecosystems and the loss of crucial habitats for many species. Step 4: Identify a specific problem or question Based on the context I've developed and some initial research, I'll now identify a specific problem or question to focus on within the context. My question is: \\"Does deforestation significantly affect the local temperature in a deforested area?\\" Step 5: Formulate a hypothesis Now that I have a specific question in mind, I'll create a hypothesis that suggests a possible relationship or answer to the question. My hypothesis is: \\"Deforestation significantly increases local temperatures in deforested areas due to the loss of tree cover, which reduces the natural cooling effect provided by the trees.\\" This hypothesis asserts that there is a notable relationship between deforestation and local temperature changes.

He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base.

The celebration is interrupted when a battery of Cossacks ride through the village square in an arson attack and their cats likewise attack the village mice. As a result, the Moskowitz home, along with that of the Mousekewitzes, is destroyed. In Hamburg, Germany, the Mousekewitzes board a tramp steamer headed for America. The crossing proves itself long and onerous, as well as the tramp steamer being buffeted by an angry sea.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - after using water - after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - after using soap A:","response":"After using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"question":"Article: Although makeup can be great for hiding acne, it can also cause breakouts. Over applying makeups or using particularly oily products can clog your pores and lead to infections. If you are getting breakouts on certain parts of your face, try a different product and see if it clears up. In general, try to use products that are oil-free or noncomedogenic. You should also look for makeups that contain acne-fighting ingredients. Always remove your makeup before you go to bed. If your skin is particularly oily, you may need to use a special makeup remover instead of simply washing your face. If you suffer from breakouts on your forehead, scalp, neck, and back, the culprit may be your hair products. Products like gels, pomades, and sprays tend to block pores and irritate your skin. They can also cause allergic reactions that can result in acne. To avoid acne, experiment with different products to find one that does not irritate your skin. In general, look for products with shorter and more natural ingredient lists. In particular, look for products that are fragrance-free and noncomedogenic (non-pore clogging). To avoid using too much product, consider washing your hair two or three times a week or rinse it with conditioner daily. You might also want to consider sleeping with your hair up to avoid rolling around in your dirty hair all night. If you believe that you are having an allergic reaction to a certain product, quit using it and talk to your doctor or a dermatologist. You may want to be tested so you know what to avoid in the future. Because your hands come in contact with numerous objects during the day, they can transfer countless bacteria to your face, resulting in breakouts. If you rest your head in your hands, you may get breakouts on your chin or cheeks. To avoid this, wash your hands regularly and try to touch your face as little as possible. If you tend to get breakouts around your nose, your glasses may be the culprit. Your glasses house bacteria that can cause infections. In addition, they rub and put pressure on your skin, which can irritate it and stimulate oil production. If your glasses are causing you acne, consider using a spot treatment or ditching your glasses entirely and wear contacts. Be sure to regularly clean the nose pads of your glasses by washing them with hot soapy water. This remove any bacteria that might cause a breakout. Whenever you pull hairs from a follicle, you create an opening that is susceptible to infection. If you have your eyebrows plucked or any facial hair waxed, such as around your mouth and chin, you might see some breakouts. To avoid this, limit how often you pluck or wax any facial hairs. Shaving can have a similar effect, especially if you use a dull razor that pulls the hairs from the follicle instead of cutting them. Try sugaring or threading as alternatives to plucking or waxing. If you must pluck or wax your hair, use some basic precautions to avoid potential breakouts: Gently exfoliate and cleanse your skin before plucking or waxing. Use an anti-microbial pre-wax cleanser. Carefully clean your hands and nails before plucking and waxing, and wear disposable gloves during waxing and cleanup. Cleanse again after plucking or waxing, and gently exfoliate the next day. Keep the freshly waxed or plucked areas clean and free from sweat, dirt, or irritating products. Because most people take them everywhere (even to the bathroom) and touch them constantly, cellular phones are covered in bacteria. Whenever you talk on your phones, you are rubbing those bacteria all over your face. This can lead to breakouts on your cheeks and chin. To avoid any phone-related breakouts, consider using your phone's speaker function or getting a hands-free Bluetooth headpiece. You can also minimize phone-related breakouts by regularly cleaning your phone with antibacterial wipes. What is a summary?","response":"In summary, makeup and certain hair products can cause acne breakouts due to clogged pores, infections, and allergic reactions. To prevent acne, use oil-free, noncomedogenic, and fragrance-free products, and remove makeup before going to bed. Washing hair a few times a week and sleeping with it up can also help. Avoid touching your face with dirty hands, and clean glasses regularly to prevent breakouts around the nose. Plucking, waxing, and shaving can cause breakouts, so try alternative hair removal methods or take extra precautions before and after hair removal. Lastly, mobile phones carry bacteria that cause breakouts; using the speaker function or cleaning the phone with antibacterial wipes can help prevent acne."},{"question":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","response":"Sentence: The motivated gardener worked diligently on transforming the barren land into a thriving and vibrant garden.

Ambassador Susan Rice is the leading contender to become the White House’s new national security adviser, following a failed bid to become secretary of state, a senior Obama administration official told Fox News this weekend. President Obama could appoint Rice without the Senate confirmation needed for a Cabinet post. Rice withdrew herself from consideration for the secretary of state post in the face of withering criticism by congressional Republicans and others for her handling of the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, Libya terror attacks. Five days after the attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, Rice said the attacks appeared spontaneous and sparked by an anti-Islamic video.

He is most famous for unearthing the palace of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete. Evans continued Heinrich Schliemann's concept of a Mycenaean civilization, but found that he needed to distinguish another civilization, the Minoan, from the structures and artifacts found there and throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Evans was also the first to define Cretan scripts Linear A and Linear B, as well as an earlier pictographic writing. Context: Evans and Margaret moved back to Oxford, renting a house there in January 1883. This period of unemployment was the only one of his life; he employed himself finishing up his Balkan studies. He completed his articles on Roman roads and cities there. It was suggested that he apply to a new Professorship of Classical Archaeology at Oxford. When he found out that Jowett and Newton were among the electors, he decided not to apply. He wrote to Freeman that to confine archaeology to classics was an absurdity. Instead he and Margaret travelled to Greece, seeking out Heinrich Schliemann at Athens. Margaret and Sophia had a long visit for several hours, during which Evans examined the Mycenaean antiquities at hand with Heinrich. Meanwhile, Ashmolean Museum, an adjunct of Oxford University, was in a chaotic state of transition. It had been a natural history museum, but the collections had been transferred to other museums. The lower floor housed some art and archaeology, but the upper floor was being used for university functions. John Henry Parker, appointed the first keeper in 1870, had the task of trying to manage it. His efforts to negotiate with the art collector C. Drury E. Fortnum, over housing his extensive collection, were being undercut university administrators. In January 1874, Parker died. The museum was in the hands of its assistant keepers, one of whom, Edward Evans (no relation), was to be Evans's executive during Evans's extended absences. The strategy for the museum now was to convert it to an art and archaeology museum, expanding the remaining collections . In November 1883, Fortnum wrote to Evans asking for his assistance in locating some letters in the Bodleian Library that would help to validate a noted ring in his collection; he did so on the advice of John Evans of the Society of Antiquaries. Unable to find the letters, Arthur Evans suggested Fortnum visit Oxford. Fortnum in fact was becoming dissatisfied with rivals for his collection, the South Kensington Museum, because of their \\"lack of a properly informed and competent person as keeper.\\" Evans had the right qualifications and took the position of keeper at the Ashmolean when it was offered. In 1884, therefore, Evans, at the age of 34, was appointed Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. He held a grand inauguration at which he outlined his planned changes, publishing it as The Ashmolean as a Home of Archaeology in Oxford. Already the great frontage building had been erected. Evans took it firmly in the direction of being an archaeology museum. He insisted the artifacts be transferred back to the museum, negotiated for and succeeded in acquiring Fortnum's collections, later gave his father's collections to the museum, and finally, bequeathed his own Minoan collections, not without the intended effect. Today it has the finest Minoan assemblages outside Crete.

This notion of \\" a life \\" is subjective. You need to reflect on what is important to you.","response":"Once you have a clear understanding of what a life means to you, it's time to assess your current situation and identify the areas where you may be lacking fulfillment or experiencing imbalance. Think about the different aspects of your life, such as personal growth, relationships, career, health, hobbies, and emotional well-being. Take a step back and consider the bigger picture, recognizing how your values, beliefs, and goals align with the life you have envisioned for yourself. It's essential to make time for meaningful reflection and introspection, as this provides the foundation for establishing your priorities and setting actionable goals. Start by evaluating your priorities and identifying which areas of your life need improvement or change. Create a list of short-term and long-term goals that reflect your aspirations and contribute to the achievement of the life you desire. These goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to ensure clarity, direction, and motivation. As you progress, regularly reassess your goals and adjust them as needed to maintain alignment with the ever-evolving vision of your ideal life. Developing a strong support network is crucial for personal growth and achieving a fulfilled life. Surround yourself with people who share your values, offer encouragement, and challenge you to grow. Engage in social activities that provide opportunities to build meaningful connections with like-minded individuals and foster a sense of community. Take the initiative to lend a hand to others in need and participate in volunteering activities, as acts of kindness and giving back can contribute significantly to your overall well-being and sense of worth. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is pivotal to leading a fulfilling life. It's essential to set boundaries and allocate time for leisure, self-care, and personal interests. Cultivate hobbies and interests that ignite your passions and nurture your creativity, such as music, art, sports, or gardening. Continuously strive for personal growth by investing in your education and skill development, with endeavors like enrolling in courses or workshops, attending seminars, or reading books that expand your knowledge and understanding of the topics that interest you. Physical health and well-being play a vital role in living a satisfying life. Incorporate a regular exercise routine to maintain a healthy body and mind, with activities that you enjoy and suit your lifestyle. Developing healthy eating habits, getting sufficient sleep, and practicing stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, or journaling, can help strike a balance and promote overall well-being. Lastly, embrace change and be open to new experiences. Leaving your comfort zone may be challenging, but it is often necessary for personal growth and self-discovery. Learn to recognize and overcome your fears and insecurities that might be holding you back from reaching your full potential. Embrace failures as learning experiences and practice gratitude to maintain a positive outlook on life. Whichever path or direction you choose to follow, remember that the journey towards \\"getting a life\\" is an ongoing process marked by self-discovery, growth, and adaptation.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. gas B. health problems C. enjoy D. death E. gain weight Answer:","response":"Answer: B. health problems, E. gain weight The result of the man's actions can be primarily related to two options: health problems and gaining weight. The man's habit of consuming hamburgers and indulging in unhealthy eating without engaging in any exercise could lead him to experience various health problems. These could include various lifestyle diseases, such as cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Over time, continuous consumption of high-fat, high-calorie fast food like hamburgers coupled with a sedentary lifestyle would lead to weight gain, making the man susceptible to a myriad of health issues. Gaining weight falls under option E, and this increase in weight can eventually result in obesity. Obesity can worsen existing health issues or lead to the development of new problems such as type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, health problems covered in option B often comprise both physical and mental health aspects. The man's physical health may deteriorate due to unhealthy dietary choices, lack of exercise, and increased body weight, while his mental health could suffer as a consequence of poor body image, lowered self-esteem, or even mood disorders such as depression or anxiety. In summary, the man's preference to eat hamburgers combined with a lack of exercise would most likely result in health problems and gaining weight.

They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point.

The UN human rights chief on Monday slammed Myanmar's apparent \\"systematic attack\\" on the Rohingya minority, warning that \\"ethnic cleansing\\" seemed to be underway. \\"Because Myanmar has refused access to human rights investigators the current situation cannot yet be fully assessed, but the situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing,\\" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein told the UN Human Rights Council. The Rohingya are reviled in Myanmar, where the roughly one million-strong community are accused of being illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The United Nations says 294,000 bedraggled and exhausted Rohingya refugees have arrived in Bangladesh since the militants' attacks on Myanmar security forces in neighbouring Rakhine state on August 25 sparked a major military backlash. Tens of thousands more are believed to be on the move inside Rakhine after more than two weeks without shelter, food and water. \\"The operation... is clearly disproportionate and without regard for basic principles of international law,\\" Zeid said. \\"We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians,\\" he said. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, condemns Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi's government has come in for strong international criticism over the military's treatment of the Rohingya. \\"I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,\\" Zeid said. He said he was particularly \\"appalled\\" by reports that Myanmar authorities had begun laying landmines along the border with Bangladesh to prevent those who fled from returning. He also criticised \\"official statements that refugees who have fled the violence will only be allowed back if they can provide 'proof of nationality',\\" pointing out that Myanmar since 1962 had been stripping Rohingyas of a wide range of rights, including citizenship rights. \\"This measure resembles a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return,\\" he said. Zeid urged the Myanmar government to \\"stop pretending that the Rohingyas are setting fire to their own homes and laying waste to their own villages.\\" \\"This complete denial of reality is doing great damage to the international standing of a government which, until recently, benefited from immense good will,\\" he said, calling on authorities to allow his office access to investigate the situation in the country.

Speaking as she visited a refugee camp, Sheikh Hasina urged Myanmar to view the situation with humanity, saying innocent people were suffering. Some 370,000 Rohingyas have crossed the border since violence began last month. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies it is targeting civilians. But many of those who have fled say troops responded to attacks by Rohingya militants on 25 August with a brutal campaign of violence and village burnings aimed at driving them out. The BBC has spoken to Rohingyas maimed by landmines as they fled Myanmar. Bangladeshi sources say Myanmar's army recently planted new mines - an allegation denied by Myanmar officials. The Rohingyas, a stateless mostly Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Rakhine, have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, which says they are illegal immigrants. Bangladesh is already home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas who have fled previous outbreaks of violence in Myanmar. Its two official refugee camps are full and aid agencies say the new arrivals desperately need food, shelter and medical help. 'These people... are suffering' Sheikh Hasina's comments came as she visited the Kutupalong camp, one of the official camps. \\"My personal message is very clear, that they should consider this situation with the eyes of humanity,\\" she told the BBC.

About 32,000 registered refugees live in the two official camps, but more than 300,000 undocumented Rohingyas were also estimated to be in Bangladesh before this latest influx. Bangladesh says their presence strains local resources, increases crime and deters tourists in the Cox's Bazar area. Earlier this year, it backed a plan to transfer them to an island in the Bay of Bengal, Thengar Char, but rights groups said the island was unfit for human habitation due to seasonal flooding. International condemnation grows Myanmar is facing mounting criticism over the Rohingya crisis and there have been protests in several Muslim-majority nations. UN human rights chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein said on Monday that the security operation in Rakhine appeared to be \\"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\".

The UN Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the Rakhine crisis. ||||| COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Pressure mounted on Myanmar on Tuesday to end violence that has sent about 370,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, with the United States calling for protection of civilians and Bangladesh urging safe zones to enable refugees to go home. But China, which competes for influence in its southern neighbor with the United States, said it backed Myanmar’s efforts to safeguard “development and stability”. The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting Rohingya militants behind a surge of violence in Rakhine state that began on Aug. 25, and they are doing all they can to avoid harming civilians. The government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting, the latest in the western state. The top U.N. human rights official denounced Myanmar on Monday for conducting a “cruel military operation” against Rohingya, branding it “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. The United States said the violent displacement of the Rohingya showed Myanmar’s security forces were not protecting civilians. Washington has been a staunch supporter of Myanmar’s transition from decades of harsh military rule that is being led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. “We call on Burmese security authorities to respect the rule of law, stop the violence, and end the displacement of civilians from all communities,” the White House said in a statement. Myanmar government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment but the foreign ministry said shortly before the U.S. statement was issued that Myanmar was also concerned about the suffering. Its forces were carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order in response to acts of extremism. “The government of Myanmar fully shares the concern of the international community regarding the displacement and suffering of all communities affected by the latest escalation of violence ignited by the acts of terrorism,” the ministry said in a statement. Myanmar’s government regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship, even though many Rohingya families have lived there for generations. Attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), on police posts and an army base in the north of Rakhine on Aug. 25 provoked the military counter-offensive that refugees say is aimed at pushing Rohingya out of the country. A similar but smaller wave of attacks by the same insurgents last October also sparked what critics called a heavy-handed response by the security forces that sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. Reports from refugees and rights groups paint a picture of widespread attacks on Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine by the security forces and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who have put numerous Muslim villages to the torch. But Myanmar authorities have denied that the security forces, or Buddhist civilians, have been setting the fires, instead blaming the insurgents. Nearly 30,000 Buddhist villagers have also been displaced, they say. ‘STOP THE VIOLENCE’ The U.N. Security Council is to meet on Wednesday behind closed doors for the second time during the crisis since Aug. 25. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said he hoped there would be a public statement agreed by the council on the crisis. “It is important that the Security Council plays its role in responding,” said Sweden’s U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog said on Tuesday. Britain and Sweden requested the meeting. However, rights groups slammed the 15-member council for not holding a public meeting. Diplomats have said China and Russia would likely object to such a move and protect Myanmar if there was any push for council action to try and end the crisis. Rohingya refugees walk on the shore after crossing the Bangladesh-Myanmar border by boat through the Bay of Bengal in Shah Porir Dwip, Bangladesh September 11, 2017. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui “This is ethnic cleansing on a large scale it seems, and the Security Council can’t open its doors and stand in front of the cameras? It’s appalling, frankly,” Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau told reporters on Tuesday. Sherine Tadros, head Amnesty International in New York, said if the council doesn’t act “the price is being paid.” “The danger is without some sort of public proclamation by Security Council members ... the message that you’re sending to the Myanmar government is deadly, and they will continue to do it,” Tadros told reporters. The exodus to Bangladesh shows no sign of slowing with 370,000 the latest estimate, according to a U.N. refugee agency spokeswoman, up from an estimate of 313,000 on the weekend. Bangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingyas. Many refugees are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season. The United Nations said 200,000 children needed urgent support. Two emergency flights organized by the U.N. refugee agency arrived in Bangladesh with aid for about 25,000 refugees. More flights are planned with the aim of helping 120,000, a spokesman said. Worry is also growing about conditions inside Rakhine State, with fears a hidden humanitarian crisis may be unfolding. Myanmar has rejected a ceasefire declared by ARSA to enable the delivery of aid there, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists. But Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Myanmar should set up safe zones to enable the refugees to go home. “Myanmar will have to take back all Rohingya refugees who entered Bangladesh,” Hasina said on a visit to the Cox’s Bazar border district where she distributed aid. Slideshow (12 Images) “Myanmar has created the problem and they will have to solve it,” she said, adding: “We want peaceful relations with our neighbors, but we can’t accept any injustice. “Stop this violence against innocent people.” Myanmar has said those who can verify their citizenship can return but most Rohingya are stateless. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, “The international community should support Myanmar in its efforts to safeguard development and stability.” ||||| [versi Bahasa Indonesia] In the past week, it has been reported that the military under Aung San Suu Kyi’s Government of Myanmar has been attacking the predominantly muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine, Myanmar. According to the reports, the Rohingyas — including women and children — have been killed and physically tortured. According to the European Rohingya Council (ERC), 3,000 Rohingyas have been killed within three days between 25 and 27 August, 2017. Their villages have been burned to the ground. The military claimed that this was an effort to eliminate terrorism. Until this second, the de facto ruler of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi has done virtually nothing to stop this crime against humanity in her country. As a result, there are many of the Rohingyas fled their homes and are stranded in the Myanmar’s border with Bangladesh. The International Organization of Migration (IOM) reported that there are at least 18,445 Rohingya refugees currently fled the area (bbc.com). But Suu Kyi as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate appears to be deaf and have done nothing to protect her citizens. Meanwhile, in 2013, Suu Kyi made a controversial statement that appeared to be anti-Islam. “No one told me that I was to be interviewed by a muslim.” This statement was made by Aung San Suu Kyi, after her interview by a BBC Today anchor, Mishal Husain, in 2013. Suu Kyi’s disappointment may be caused by the question asked by Husain on the hardships experienced by muslims in Myanmar. Suu Kyi was also asked to condemn the anti-muslims and those who acted violently against the muslims that led the Rohingyas to leave Myanmar (from Popham, Peter, Journalist for The Independent, The Lady and The Generals — Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma’s Struggle for Freedom, 2016). Many people were caught by surprise that those words came from Suu Kyi, a democracy hero in Myanmar and a 2012 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. It might only be one racially-insensitive sentence, but that was one sentence too many, and the meaning is too much for those who love peace. Many people in many countries, including in Indonesia, respect and admire Suu Kyi. She is known as a figure of patience, of peace loving, who eventually took back the power in her country peacefully from the military dictatorship in Myanmar. Her statement made many more disappointed and angry. This opens up the prevailing question regarding Suu Kyi’s position on the muslim minority in Myanmar. There has been no official position from Suu Kyi with regards to the human right violations that have been rampant as experienced by the Rohingya minority. Over the past three years more than 140,000 Rohingya muslims have been living in grave conditions in refugee camps in Myanmar and in many other countries, including Indonesia. What is wrong with being a muslim, Suu Kyi? Doesn't democracy and human rights teach us to respect differences in beliefs and celebrate brotherhood and sisterhood? Whatever the religion, shouldn’t Suu Kyi and all of us respect each other and not discriminate against other human beings? Coming from a democratic hero, one racist statement is one too many. It destroys the democratic values that respects differences in beliefs. As a laureate of Nobel Peace Prize, a racist statement renders the peaceful values to be artificial, giving rise to suspicions even conflicts. The Nobel Prize is the highest prize only to be given to “people who have given their utmost to international brotherhood and sisterhood.” These peaceful values need to be nurtured by the laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize, including Suu Kyi, until their last days. When a laureate cannot maintain peace, then for the sake of peace itself the prize needs to be returned or confiscated by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. Therefore, we hereby demand the Chair of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee confiscate or take back the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi. Only those who are serious in keeping the world peace may be awarded such a coveted Prize. ---- This petition is initiated and supported by Emerson Yuntho; Hamid Basyaib; Agus Sari; Nong Darol Mahmada; Ulin Yusron; Zainal Arifin Mochtar; Saidiman Ahmad; Ahmad Mukhlis Yusuf; Teguh Juwarno; Syamsul Munir; Naufal Firman Yursak; Kusfuardi; Ahmad Farhan; Andi Harianto Sinulingga; Andy Budiman; Goenawan Mohamad; Bonnie Triyana; Berly Martawardaya; Iwan Gunawan; Mirwan Bz Vauly; Effendi Ishak; Tatat Rahmita Utami; Fajar R.

From the moment I stepped through the door to the moment I, sadly, had to take my leave, this establishment managed to captivate me with its perfect blend of ambiance, service, and of course, the pièce de résistance: the delectable dishes that left me dreaming about them for days on end. I was first greeted by their warm and inviting atmosphere that set the tone for the rest of the evening. The soft lighting, rustic decor, and carefully curated playlist created the kind of cozy and intimate environment that I look for in a dining space. It was clear that the owner and staff put a great amount of effort into ensuring that their patrons have the most enjoyable and comfortable experience possible. Now, let's talk service. I have never encountered such attentive, polite, and genuinely caring staff as I did at Bistr-Oh-Mazing. Our server, Lily, was an absolute ray of sunshine, ready with a smile and insightful recommendations tailored to our preferences. She managed to be ever-present, yet unintrusive, striking a perfect balance that never left us feeling ignored or overwhelmed. She truly made our evening all the more delightful. However, what truly sets Bistr-Oh-Mazing apart from the rest is its culinary artistry. I opted for their signature dish, the Seared Scallops with a Pomegranate Glaze, and I can confidently say that it was one of the best meals I've ever tasted. A perfect melody of flavors and textures, the sweet glaze was the perfect complement to the succulent scallops, while the crunch of the accompanying asparagus added depth to the dish. My partner's Duck Confit was equally memorable, with the tender meat falling right off the bone and the rich flavors lingering tantalizingly on the palate. To end the evening on a sweet note, we decided to indulge ourselves in the Chef's special, a Flourless Chocolate Lava Cake. Just when we thought we couldn't be more impressed, this dessert proved us wrong. With its rich and velvety texture, and the warm, molten center oozing onto the plate, every bite was pure chocaholic bliss! And in case all of this wasn't enough, they also offer an extensive wine list, showcasing the best and most carefully chosen wines from across the globe. Each wine has been expertly selected to complement their delicious dishes, just sealing the fact that Bistr-Oh-Mazing is the epitome of culinary mastery. To sum it all up, if you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience that will continue to linger in your memory and evoke fond thoughts long after you've left, then Bistr-Oh-Mazing is the place for you. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant to anyone and everyone who appreciates the art of exquisite dining. So go ahead, treat yourself and your loved ones to a dinner you won't forget – I know I'll be back very soon!"},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Thanks to a young waiter, I only recently discovered that a friend of 20 years was once a yo-yo virtuoso . \\"Oh, stop it!\\" Jackie said when I started laughing during our dinner. \\"I was, too. And I knew how to 'Walk the Dog.' \\" \\"Wow, really?\\" said our waiter, Jumario Simmons, flashing a big smile at us. \\"Don't encourage her,\\" I said. \\"What else could you do?\\" he asked. \\"I did 'Round the World,'\\" Jackie said, now ignoring me completely. \\"That cradle thing, too.\\" I'd asked Jumario what he did when he wasn't waiting on tables. The 24-year-old waiter was so smart that I knew there had to be more to his story. It turns out that he won a regional yo-yo competition last year. He also gives free lessons to kids. \\"It gives them something to do,\\" Jumario said. \\"Keeps them off the streets.\\" One of the great things about eating out is the table talk with strangers, which reminds us that everyone has a life and a name. But the other day I heard that some restaurants are ending this talk between diners and servers. I listened to the reporter describe how their improvements are allowing customers to text orders from their tables to speed up service. The reporter got my attention with this sentence: \\"Five minutes after typing 'I'm at table 3', a meal arrives at the table.\\" But there wasn't a \\"please\\" with this order, which should have been a request, by the way. If you've ever waited on tables, you know that the last thing you need is yet another way for a customer to be unpleasant. Most servers are constantly mediating between customers' requests for substitutions and overworked cooks' accusations of treason. Except at high-end restaurants, servers also have to hover like mothers of preschoolers so that we might consider them worthy of a large enough tip to lift their pay to minimum wage. Texting a server from a table a few feet away is equal to moving our fingers and shouting, \\"Hey, you!\\" It was rude in 1957, and it's rude now. You won't ever find me texting a waiter or waitress.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. A team of biologists has been monitoring the deer population in the state of Wisconsin. They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable. If the biologists predict a decrease in deer birth rates are there a high amount of resources or low amount of resources?

Options: - set off - melted - heat up - back up - red reasoning:","response":"The correct answer is: heat up Reasoning: When a car is left out in the sun for an extended period, the sunlight can cause the interior to heat up significantly. This is due to the sun's rays entering through the windows and being trapped inside the car, which creates a greenhouse effect. Depending on the materials used in the car's interior, it can become very uncomfortable or even dangerous to touch surfaces that have been exposed to the heat.

A versatile defensive player, Haley began his career as a specialty outside linebacker, eventually progressing to pass-rusher and finally full-fledged defensive end. He is the first five-time Super Bowl champion, and is one of only two such players, the other being Tom Brady. He won two Super Bowls with the 49ers (XXIII, XXIV) and three with the Cowboys (XXVII, XXVIII, XXX); he was a starter in all five championship games. In 1992, Haley was moved to right defensive end in the Dallas Cowboys 4-3 defense, made 39 tackles, 6 sacks, and 42 quarterback pressures (led the team), and helped the team improve from 17th in total defense in 1991 to first. Haley received the UPI NFC Defensive Player of the Year Award and was a consensus All-Pro once again. He is often mentioned as the final piece that helped propel the Cowboys into a Super Bowl contender. In 1993, Haley made headlines after smashing his helmet through a wall in the locker room following a home loss to the Buffalo Bills, showing his displeasure with the team's inability to sign holdout running back Emmitt Smith, which contributed to an 0-2 start and put the season in jeopardy. The Cowboys relented and reached an agreement with Smith the following week, getting them back on track and making them the first team to win a Super Bowl after starting a season 0-2. He registered 41 tackles, 4 sacks, 2 passes defensed, and 3 forced fumbles, but his recurring back problems began to require a series of surgeries. In 1994, Haley recovered from off-season surgery (lumbar microdiscectomy) to post 68 tackles, 12.5 sacks, and 52 quarterback pressures. He immediately announced his retirement after losing 28-38 to the 49ers in the NFC Championship game, but decided to return after being offered a new contract. In 1995, Haley posted 10.5 sacks, 33 quarterback pressures, and 35 tackles in the first 10 games, until suffering a ruptured disk against the Washington Redskins, which derailed his season. He started in Super Bowl XXX six weeks after having back surgery, making one sack, 3 quarterback pressures and 5 tackles. The next year, with the team trying to limit him to 30 plays per game, he appeared in the first three contests, in week 9 and 10, before being deactivated with a back injury. He retired after the season, because of his back injuries and his youngest daughter Brianna having been diagnosed with leukemia. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: did he break any records","response":"Charles Haley is a very special football player. He played in a big league called the NFL. He played with two teams, the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys. He was really good at stopping other players and helping his team win. He won five Super Bowl games, which is like winning the biggest prize in football. He is one of only two players who has won five times. He had some problems with his back and had to have surgery, but he still played well even after that. He decided to stop playing after his back hurt too much and because his little girl Brianna got very sick. In this story, there isn't a specific record that he broke, but winning five Super Bowls is a very big achievement."},{"question":"You like awesome food and service?! This is your spot!

They pass the time with small talk, and Donny looks at a photo of his wife, Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below, a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver, each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear, firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically picks off numerous hostiles, allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper's position, and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base, their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection, as the Americans aren't supposed to be in the country, and Swagger and Donny are abandoned, left to fend for themselves, left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR, and returns fire on the helicopter, bringing it down in flames. The smoke engulfs the screen as the helicopter crashes and explodes.Three years later Swagger is a private citizen, living in the mountains, a recluse from the world that abandoned him. Unshaven and long haired, he lives alone; his only companion his dog, trained to open the fridge and take out a cold beer for Swagger as he returns to his cabin. Sharing a slurp of the beer with his dog, Swagger turns on his PC and the Internet, looking at news of a world that mostly has him shaking his head.

Answer:","response":"No answer."},{"question":"Information: - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The United States Coast Guard cutter USCGC Morgenthau ( WHEC - 722 ) is the eighth of twelve 378 - foot dual - powered turbine / diesel Hamilton - class high endurance cutters ( WHECs ) built by Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans , Louisiana . The Coast Guard commissioned the Morgenthau military high endurance cutter on March 10 , 1969 . As of November 2013 Morgenthau is homeported in Honolulu , Hawaii , at Sand Island , a small island within Honolulu 's city limits . The cutter currently patrols from South America to the Bering Sea , conducting counter-narcotics missions , alien migrant interdiction operations , foreign and domestic fisheries enforcement , and search and rescue . In the 1960s - 1970s the \`\` jet - powered '' Hamilton - class cutters were state - of - the - art , technologically innovative , and the pride of the Coast Guard cutter fleet . However , in 2011 the Coast Guard acknowledged Hamilton class cutters have exceeded service life and stated the Coast Guard is making steady progress in replacing its 12 Hamilton Class cutters with eight National Security Cutters . At the time , the most distinctive aspect of the Hamilton - class cutters were its twin turbine engines capable of propelling the cutter from 0 to 30 + knots in 60 seconds ( and with its large variable - pitch propellers , coming to a full stop equally fast ) Due to the Cold War , Hamilton - class cutters were configured for anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) : the ability to find , track , and damage or destroy enemy submarines . Each ship has a helicopter flight deck , and retractable hangar within which to store a helicopter for missions . Other features noteworthy at the time included a variable - pitch propeller , and bow thruster allowing the ship to berth horizontally to a dock . The cutter has comfortable quarters , and the capability to stay at sea for 45 days . Over its long , distinguished 43 - year career ( 1969 - ) Morgenthau has received numerous awards , commendations , and unit citations , including a Navy Meritorious... - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II. - Ingalls Shipbuilding is a shipyard located in Pascagoula, Mississippi, United States, originally established in 1938, and is now part of Huntington Ingalls Industries. It is a leading producer of ships for the United States Navy, and at 12,500 employees and going to hire 1,500 more employees, the largest private employer in Mississippi. - Avondale Shipyard was an independent shipbuilding company, acquired by Litton Industries, in turn acquired by Northrop Grumman Corporation.

Question: suppose a person is feeling breathless happens, how will it affect more luggage checked. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"Feeling breathless is likely to have no direct effect on the number of luggage checked. However, it may affect the overall travel experience for the person. In this situation, if a person is feeling breathless, it might be due to anxiety, stress, or a medical condition. While this could potentially make the experience of checking luggage more taxing for the individual, it does not inherently impact the number of luggage items that need to be checked. In terms of the second effect mentioned (\\"the passenger waits in line\\"), if a person is feeling breathless, it might influence their experience waiting in line, making it more uncomfortable or tiring.

Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses, and a temporary decline in fertility. After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974, there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving, especially for the Middle East, which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s. Today more than two-thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

The original line-up included Jaz Coleman (vocals, keyboards), Paul Ferguson (drums), Geordie Walker (guitars) and Youth (bass). Their first album, Killing Joke, was released in 1980. After the release of Revelations in 1982, bassist Youth was replaced by Paul Raven. A Killing Joke anthology, Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!, was released in 1992; during its production, Walker became reacquainted with Youth, who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass. That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs \\"Change\\" and \\"Wardance\\" in several new versions remixed by Youth, who was by then a very successful producer. Coleman produced the 1993 debut album Churn by the New Zealand band Shihad, and Shihad drummer Tom Larkin played on some of the songs on the next Killing Joke album, Pandemonium. Relations later soured between Coleman and Shihad due to a dispute over Coleman's production fee for Churn. The reactivated Killing Joke released two strong and well-received albums on Youth's Butterfly Recordings label, Pandemonium and Democracy, which saw the band shifting back to the simpler arrangements of their early albums. They also employed young talent like Waxworth Industries for 12-inch remixes in order to provide an alternative inroad to the band's new and evolving sound. Pandemonium (1994) melded a metallic, ritualistic sound with mosh beats and loops, and earned Killing Joke a memorable Top of the Pops appearance for the single \\"Millennium\\", which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20). The title track was also released as a single and made the UK Top 30. In 1995, the band recorded the song \\"Hollywood Babylon\\" for the soundtrack of Paul Verhoeven's movie Showgirls. Democracy (1996) successfully introduced acoustic guitar into the mix, as well as adopting more of a \\"live band\\" sound again. The title track was again released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of Pandemonium and all of Democracy featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore. He also played live with the band throughout this era. Nick Holywell-Walker joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on Democracy and XXV Gathering. Youth bowed out of live performance early in the Democracy tour and was replaced by Troy Gregory previously of Prong. After the Democracy tour, the band went on an extended hiatus. Coleman and Youth produced a string of well-received orchestral rock albums based on the music of legends such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Doors. Coleman became composer-in-residence for New Zealand and Czech symphony orchestras, and made his acting debut with the main role in the film Rok dabla (Year of the Devil) by Czech filmmaker Petr Zelenka. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What happened in 1992?","response":"In 1992, there was a special collection of Killing Joke's music, called \\"Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!\\", that was released. Also in 1992, Geordie Walker, one of the members of the band, met with Youth who used to play bass in their band. Youth had an idea that they should start the band again and that he should play bass again. In that same year, they also made new versions of their old songs \\"Change\\" and \\"Wardance\\".

Guru Pitka is the #2 Guru in the world, after Deepak Chopra. A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others. Pitka's dream is to become the number #1 Guru and appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer and Mariska Hargitay. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in PowerPoint slide shows. In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival Los Angeles Kings player, Jacques \\"Lè Cocq\\" Grandé. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair.

Wright Electric said by removing the need for jet fuel, the price of travel could drop dramatically. British low-cost airline Easyjet has expressed its interest in the technology. \\"Easyjet has had discussions with Wright Electric and is actively providing an airline operator's perspective on the development of this exciting technology,\\" the airline told the BBC. However, significant hurdles need to be overcome if Wright Electric is to make the Wright One, pictured above, a reality. The company is relying heavily on innovation in battery technology continuing to improve at its current rate. If not, the firm will not be able to build in enough power to give the plane the range it needs. The company is yet to produce a plane of its own and is instead working alongside American inventor Chip Yates, whose own electric aircraft, the Long-ESA, holds the world record for fastest electric aircraft. Wright Electric's competitors include aviation giant Airbus, which has been developing its electric two-seater plane E-Fan since 2014, and has stated plans to create its own short-haul electric aeroplane seating 70 to 90 passengers. Wright Electric is backed by Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's most highly-regarded start-up incubator programme. Alumni of the scheme include companies such as AirBnB, file storage company Dropbox and HR management software firm Zenefits. Wright Electric's goal, detailed in a presentation given to potential investors on Tuesday, is to make all short-haul flights electric-powered within the next 20 years, which would be about 30% of all flights made globally. The company said that as well as lower fuel costs for the airlines, the technology could have a major added benefit for the public. \\"Depending on how it's designed, you can have an electric plane that's substantially less loud than a fuel plane,\\" said Jeff Engler, Wright Electric's co-founder. Batteries would be charged separately, he said, meaning planes would not have to sit on the tarmac while power is replenished. \\"The way we've designed our plane is to have modular battery packs for quick swap using the same cargo container that's in a regular airplane,\\" Mr Engler said. \\"We want it to be as fast as possible, so airlines can keep their planes in the air as long as possible and cover their costs.\\" Other technology start-ups are seeking to innovate within the aviation industry. Boom, a company backed by Sir Richard Branson, is developing a Concorde-like supersonic jet. It hopes to achieve London to New York in three-and-a-half hours, a journey which currently takes more than eight hours.

The form that solution takes is, in fact, a series of numbers, except that their significance is not mathematical, but geographical. For between them, they express, in ultra-precise latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, a small point on the globe, measuring no more than 20 sq ft. How are you supposed to track it down? By buying a copy of The Great Global Treasure Hunt (see overleaf) and poring over the text and pictures inside, at the same time as constantly cross-checking and cross-referring with the website Google Earth. It is, not to put too fine a point on it, an Everest-sized challenge. To help you limber up, the creators of The Great Global Treasure Hunt have devised an exclusive one-off puzzle set for Weekend readers: the Standing Tall Treasure Hunt, which will win the solver of said conundrum a trip to an exciting location – the clues and hints are overleaf. So far as The Great Global Treasure Hunt goes, the good news is that in the race to the €50,000 summit, Telegraph readers will have an advantage over all other treasure hunters, as each Saturday we will be printing an exclusive clue, in addition to the intermittent hints and tips that will be available to the whole world, both on the competition website (www.jointhetreasurehunt.com) and via the tweets emanating from www.twitter.com/dedopulos. And who, or what, pray, is Dedopulos? Why, none other than The Great Global Treasure Hunt puzzle-setter himself, who spends most of his life knee-deep in obscure manuscripts relating to codes, symbols and esoterica both scientific and paranormal. Today he has arrived, blinking, in the big city, to hand over that precise combination of digits that make up the winning solution, now entombed inside the unknown solicitor’s safe. “The solution is not written down anywhere else, I have not disclosed it to anyone, and you cannot even extract it by getting me drunk, as I do not touch alcohol,” beams the splendidly ponytailed Dedopulos beatifically, “All I can advise you to do is to look at all the clues from different angles and, by considering their implications with respect to each other, you will discover the swiftest path to the solution.” Try to press him further and he merely grins and urges you to look at the book again, only harder. Even then, the answers hardly leap out at you. Open up The Great Global Treasure Hunt and, alongside colour illustrations that look like the work of Salvador Dalí, M C Escher and René Magritte combined, you find passages of quasi-poetical text, both allusive and elusive. Each puzzle has a cryptic title, such as Facing The Gallows or Scarlet Chambers, and each page is fringed with a border of circular symbols (flowers, waterfalls, multicoloured marbles), plus seemingly random sets of numbers. They are, in fact, geographical coordinates, relating to real-life locations on Google Earth. Key in some of the digits on the first puzzle, and you will come up, surely, with part of a vital piece in the jigsaw? “Quite possibly,” comes Dedopulos’s cryptic reply. “On the other hand, it may just take you to some beautiful or amazing part of the planet which I feel you should know about. I must confess, I will feel bereft if this quest does not engender, among the participants, a sense of wonder at this amazing world.” Ah well, what do you expect from a man whose ancestor bought a Grecian dukedom from the doges of Venice, and whose emails all bear the legend: “If there were two of you, which one would win?” Slightly more helpful is the book’s illustrator, Jon Lucas, who has also come to witness the handing-over of the solution. He reveals that, with each puzzle, Dedopulos’s instructions to him were to put in five or six key images, 10-15 secondary images, and however many red herrings he pleased. However, try and quiz either the artist or the puzzlemaster on exactly how to solve the 14 challenges and they go very silent. It’s left to Piers Murray Hill, the editorial director for Carlton Publishing and the man who came up with the whole concept, to explain where Google Earth comes in. “You cannot solve this puzzle without constant reference to the Google Earth website,” he stresses. “And I mean constant. It’s not like trying to solve The Daily Telegraph general knowledge crossword on a Saturday, where you only go on the internet as a last resort, having already rung your friends and asked for help with the clues about atomic numbers. “With this competition, you have to go on Google Earth from the start. In fact, the whole idea came to me when I found that you can stick a virtual pin into your favourite locations on Google Earth. “It struck me that you could also use a pin to mark a spot where virtual treasure was hidden, thus enabling you to go on a worldwide hunt without leaving your armchair.” Thereby making this a different kind of quest from the last great treasure hunt to grip the nation, some 32 years ago. Back in 1979, author and artist Kit Williams informed the world that he had buried a valuable, bejewelled golden hare at an undisclosed location somewhere in England. The only way to discover its whereabouts was to buy his picture book Masquerade and try to solve the clues. The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide as puzzlers first pored over its pages and then set out, spade in hand, to dig up large parts of the English countryside. After two and a half years, one participant correctly identified the place where the hare was buried, in the Bedfordshire village of Ampthill, at the precise spot touched by the shadow of a monument to Catherine of Aragon, at noon on either the spring or autumn equinox. Sadly, the prize later lost its sparkle when it was revealed that the winner had received insider help from Kit Williams’s ex-girlfriend. Since then, though, says Dedopulos, treasure hunts have come a long way, and for some time now have bridged the divide between the printed and the virtual world. “There now exists a vast, alternate-reality gaming community, much of it based round the website www.unfiction.com.

To find decaying mushrooms, you can","response":"follow several strategies and techniques that would help you locate them successfully. Decaying mushrooms tend to thrive in specific conditions, and being aware of those conditions is essential for finding them. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you accomplish this goal: 1. Understand the lifecycle of mushrooms: To efficiently find decaying mushrooms, you first need to familiarize yourself with the lifecycle and growth patterns of fungi. This will enable you to predict when and where they are likely to fully mature, decay, and rot. 2. Identify the habitat: Decaying mushrooms can appear in various habitats such as forests, fields, gardens, parks, and alongside roads. They usually prefer damp, humid, and shady environments. Learning about the common habitats will allow you to focus your search and locate them efficiently. 3. Seasonal awareness: The growth and decay of mushrooms mainly depend on the seasons and weather conditions. Spring and autumn are the peak seasons for mushrooms in many regions due to the increased humidity and favorable temperatures. Heavy rain followed by warm temperatures can also trigger mushroom growth, eventually leading to decay. 4. Research local mushroom species: Different mushroom species have different lifecycles, growth patterns, and habitats that affect their decay process. Study the local mushrooms in your area to understand their preferences, behaviors, and optimal conditions for growth and decay. 5. Observe physical signs of decay: Decaying mushrooms, regardless of the species, tend to have certain visual characteristics. They may appear slimy, limp, discolored, and emit a foul odor. A close inspection of these signs on mushrooms in the wild can help you find them more easily. 6. Learn from the local community: Reach out to local mycologists, biology students, and mushroom enthusiasts in your area to glean relevant information about decaying mushrooms. They will likely have extensive knowledge about fungal hotspots and can guide you to fruitful locations. 7. Use online resources: Websites, forums, and social media groups dedicated to mycology can offer valuable information, tips, and advice on finding decaying mushrooms. Many enthusiasts share their experiences and observations, which can help you refine your search. 8. Document your findings: If you are serious about finding decaying mushrooms, maintaining a journal of your observations, discoveries, and experiences can be a powerful tool. This way, you can track and analyze patterns and trends, which will, in turn, improve your chances of locating decaying mushrooms in the future. 9. Consider using a camera or smartphone: Taking pictures of the mushrooms you discover allows you to record their appearance and location for future reference. This can help you identify optimal conditions for decay and familiarize yourself with the specific signs of decay. 10. Practice patience and perseverance: Finding decaying mushrooms takes time and patience, as their occurrence can be infrequent and unpredictable. Regular exploration, observation, and persistence are key to increasing your chances of finding decaying mushrooms. Remember always to prioritize your safety while searching for mushrooms.

Answer:","response":"\\"A Tale of Friendship, Lies, and Unbearable Consequences\\""},{"question":"Article: The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells. Glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain. The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials. Now answer this question: What is the typical speed that axons send their electrical signals?","response":"The typical speed at which axons send their electrical signals, in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, varies depending on the specific neuron.

Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys . The scientists implanted electrodes --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built.

Now, since we are asked to find the distance of Earth's orbit around the Sun in miles, we can actually use the information that was given: Earth completes its orbit in 940 million km (or 584 million mi), which is the distance it travels around the Sun in one sidereal year. So, the distance of Earth's orbit around the Sun is approximately 584 million miles."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What year was the first published score of the piece that was completed in 24 days issued? The music for Messiah was completed in 24 days of swift composition. Having received Jennens's text some time after 10 July 1741, Handel began work on it on 22 August. His records show that he had completed Part I in outline by 28 August, Part II by 6 September and Part III by 12 September, followed by two days of \\"filling up\\" to produce the finished work on 14 September. The autograph score's 259 pages show some signs of haste such as blots, scratchings-out, unfilled bars and other uncorrected errors, but according to the music scholar Richard Luckett the number of errors is remarkably small in a document of this length. The original manuscript for Messiah is now held in the British Library's music collection. It is scored for 2 trumpets, timpani, 2 oboes, 2 violins, viola, and basso continuo (cello, double bass, and harpsichord). At the end of his manuscript Handel wrote the letters \\"SDG\\"—Soli Deo Gloria, \\"To God alone the glory\\". This inscription, taken with the speed of composition, has encouraged belief in the apocryphal story that Handel wrote the music in a fervour of divine inspiration in which, as he wrote the \\"Hallelujah\\" chorus, \\"he saw all heaven before him\\". Burrows points out that many of Handel's operas, of comparable length and structure to Messiah, were composed within similar timescales between theatrical seasons. The effort of writing so much music in so short a time was not unusual for Handel and his contemporaries; Handel commenced his next oratorio, Samson, within a week of finishing Messiah, and completed his draft of this new work in a month. In accordance with his frequent practice when writing new works, Handel adapted existing compositions for use in Messiah, in this case drawing on two recently completed Italian duets and one written twenty years previously. Thus, Se tu non-lasci amore from 1722 became the basis of \\"O Death, where is thy sting?\\"; \\"His yoke is easy\\" and \\"And he shall purify\\" were drawn from Quel fior che alla'ride (July 1741), \\"Unto us a child is born\\" and \\"All we...","response":"The paragraph does not provide information about the year the first published score of the piece was issued."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Regrettably, \\"The Mundane Masterpiece\\" is not one of those films. As much as it pains me to speak in such negative terms about a production put together by people who presumably gave it their all, it has become impossible to overlook the glaring shortcomings that cast a shadow over this film. The central plot, if one can even call it that, revolves around a protagonist whose life is the epitome of mediocrity. Jonathan Blake, portrayed by an actor who delivers a shockingly lackluster performance, is mundane in every way imaginable. As the audience, we are forced to follow his depressingly dull journey of finding meaning in life. Unfortunately, the message is lost amidst the tedious events that are wrongly presumed to be compelling. The movie's dialogue is yet another unremarkable aspect. Stilted and monotonous interactions between characters, who seem to have little or no chemistry, leave behind an overwhelming sense of hollowness. It does little to advance the story, instead giving the audience a feeling that the lines are being read off a teleprompter rather than a genuine conversation rooted in emotional depth. Visually, \\"The Mundane Masterpiece\\" does not fare any better. The director's choice of a dull and lifeless color palette further emphasizes the dreariness of the story and adds to the already overwhelming melancholy that permeates the screen. Watching this film is like walking through an infinite maze of gray walls. It's hard to fathom how a cinematic creation could strip so much color and life from what could have been a thought-provoking exploration of an average person's life. Despite a runtime that is longer than necessary, this film merely scratches the surface of its characters' emotional depth. The various secondary characters we encounter throughout the film are one-dimensional, mere caricatures who have no impact on the audience's emotional investment in the story. Consequently, as the credits begin to roll, it feels as if nothing of significance has happened, and the emptiness prevails. Perhaps one of the most aggravating aspects of \\"The Mundane Masterpiece\\" is its complete lack of creativity in terms of its soundtrack. The score is repetitive and dull, often bordering on non-existent. Instead of elevating pivotal moments and invoking intended emotions within the audience, the music's monotonous nature further drowns the film in a sea of monotony. Altogether, \\"The Mundane Masterpiece\\" is a film that is almost impossible to recommend to even the most faithful of cinephiles. With its flat storyline, lifeless characters, and dreary visuals, it offers nothing more than a lesson in how not to create an engaging piece of cinema. Rather than feeling enlightened, one can't help but come out feeling disillusioned and resentful for the lost time that can never be regained after watching this film. If a foray into the world of mediocrity is what the viewer seeks, I can think of no better place to start than by subjecting oneself to this lackluster motion picture."},{"question":"How might history be considered a social science? How can the natural history as an approach be used in social science? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick from: (A). no (B). yes","response":"History can be considered a social science because it studies how people lived, worked, and interacted with each other in the past. Social science is like trying to understand how people and societies behave, and history helps us do that by looking at old stories, pictures, and things people left behind. Natural history is a way to look at the world around us, like plants, animals, and the environment. Just like how we use history to learn about people's lives, we can use natural history to learn about how people interacted with nature and used the resources around them. For the multi-choice problem, I would say the answer is: (A). no These questions are not the same because the first question asks about history as a social science, while the second question asks about using natural history in social science.

Bonn is in the southernmost part of the Rhine-Ruhr region, Germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants. - Karl Marx (5 May 1818 14 March 1883) was a German-born scientist, philosopher, economist, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. Born in Trier to a middle-class family, he later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, the most well-known being the 1848 pamphlet \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history. - Konrad Hermann Joseph Adenauer (5 January 1876 19 April 1967) was a German statesman who served as the first post-war Chancellor of Germany (West Germany) from 1949 to 1963. He led his country from the ruins of World War II to a productive and prosperous nation that forged close relations with France, the United Kingdom and the United States. During his years in power West Germany achieved democracy, stability, international respect and economic prosperity (\\"\\"Wirtschaftswunder\\"\\", German for \\"economic miracle\\"). He was the first leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a Christian Democratic party that under his leadership became, and has since usually been the most influential party in the country. - The University of Bonn is a public research university located in Bonn, Germany. Founded in its present form in 1818, as the linear successor of earlier academic institutions, the University of Bonn is today one of the leading universities in Germany. The University of Bonn offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of subjects. Its library holds more than five million volumes. The University of Bonn has 544 professors and 32,500 students. Among its notable alumni and faculty are seven Nobel Laureates, three Fields Medalist, twelve Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, Prince Albert, Pope Benedict XVI, Frederick III, Karl Marx, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Konrad Adenauer, and Joseph Schumpeter.

The league table was originally compiled and issued by Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2003, the first global ranking with multifarious indicators, after which a board of international advisories was established to provide suggestions. The publication currently includes world's overall and subject league tables, alongside independent regional \\"Greater China Ranking\\" and \\"Macedonian HEIs Ranking\\". ARWU is regarded as one of the three most influential and widely observed university measures, alongside \\"QS World University Rankings\\" and \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\\". It is praised for its objective methodology but draws some condemnation for narrowly focusing on raw research power, undermining humanities and quality of instruction. - Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (15 October 1844 25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, philologist, and Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on Western philosophy and modern intellectual history. He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869, at the age of 24. Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life, and he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and a complete loss of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother (until her death in 1897), and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, and died in 1900. - Times Higher Education World University Rankings is an annual publication of university rankings by \\"Times Higher Education (THE)\\" magazine. The publisher had collaborated with Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) to publish the joint \\"THEQS World University Rankings\\" from 2004 to 2009 before it turned to Thomson Reuters for a new ranking system.

He spent most of his career at University of Bonn . - Christian Johann Heinrich Heine (13 December 1797 17 February 1856) was a German poet, journalist, essayist, and literary critic. He is best known outside Germany for his early lyric poetry, which was set to music in the form of \\"Lieder\\" (art songs) by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. Heine's later verse and prose are distinguished by their satirical wit and irony. He is considered part of the Young Germany movement. His radical political views led to many of his works being banned by German authorities. Heine spent the last 25 years of his life as an expatriate in Paris. - The Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize is a program of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Research Foundation) which awards prizes to exceptional scientists and academics for their outstanding achievements in the field of research.

Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling.

You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content.

Throughout history, there have been documented cases of polyglots who have successfully mastered several languages. Additionally, research in linguistics suggests that the brain's plasticity enables it to adapt and store new information, including languages. Moreover, learning a new language often reinforces previously acquired knowledge and may even enhance cognitive abilities.

Jonathan and Buhari are front-runners among 14 candidates who want to govern Africa’s most populous nation beset by a northeastern Islamic uprising. Buhari, resplendent in white robes, was the first voter to have his fingerprints taken at a polling station that opened a half hour late in Daura, his hometown in northern Katsina state. The registration of Jonathan, in black with his trademark Fedora hat, was delayed in the southern oil-rich state of Bayelsa. Three newly imported card readers failed to recognize his fingerprints, and his wife’s. He returned two hours later and was accredited without the machine. Biometric cards and readers are being used for the first time to discourage the kind of fraud that has marred previous votes. Afterward, Jonathan wiped sweat from his brow and urged people to be patient as he had, telling Channels TV: “I appeal to all Nigerians to be patient no matter the pains it takes as long as if, as a nation, we can conduct free and fair elections that the whole world will accept.” Trader Angela Okele expressed concern after getting accredited in Port Harcourt, Nigeria’s southern oil capital. “The process is too slow, if it continues like this many people will not be able to cast their votes today,” she said.

At Jere, a town 38 miles north of Abuja, electoral officials said they had only one card reader, which has a capacity for about 700 voters, and twice as many people lined up. An official was sent by motorcycle to collect another. This is only the eighth election since Nigeria’s independence from Britain in 1960. In a country steeped in a history of military coups and bloodshed caused by politics, ethnicity, land disputes, oil theft and, lately, the Boko Haram Islamic uprising, the election is important as Africa’s richest nation consolidates its democracy.

Polling stations opened late in many areas as official rushed across the country delivering ballot materials by trucks, speedboats, motorcycles, mules and even camels.Photo: Getty Images There’s a lot of international interest, especially among nervous foreign investors as Nigeria is Africa’s largest destination for direct foreign investment. Its oil-dependent economy is hurting from slashed petroleum prices. Nigeria’s military announced Friday it had destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram’s so-called Islamic caliphate and driven the insurgents from all major areas in northeast Nigeria, a claim that seems unlikely. There was no way to verify the report. Critics of Jonathan have said recent military victories after months of ceding territory to the Islamic extremists are a ploy to win votes — a charge the presidential campaign denies. The failure of Jonathan’s administration to curb the insurgency, which killed about 10,000 people last year, has angered many Nigerians especially in the north. International outrage has grown over another failure — the rescue of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram nearly a year ago. The extremists have abducted hundreds more since then, using them as sex slaves and fighters. Jonathan and Buhari on Thursday signed a peace pledge and promised to accept the results of a free and fair election. But already dozens have been killed amid hate speech highlighting the religious, ethnic and geographic divisions among Nigerians.

The population of 170 million is almost evenly divided between Christians and Muslims. Some 1,000 people were killed in rioting after Buhari lost to Jonathan in the 2011 elections. Thousands of Nigerians and foreign workers have left the country amid fears of post-election violence. In 2011, there was no doubt that Jonathan had swept the polls by millions of votes. Now the race is much closer. The game-changer that transformed Nigeria’s political landscape came two years ago when the main opposition parties formed a coalition and for the first time united behind one candidate, Buhari. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"Here's the important parts of the story explained like I'm talking to a five year old: A very important event happened in Nigeria, a big country in Africa, where people were deciding who they wanted to be their big leader, the president. The two main people who could become the president were a man named Goodluck Jonathan, who was already the president, and another man named Muhammadu Buhari. Lots and lots of people came out to vote. Voting is when people pick who they want to be their leader. Sometimes, these people had to wait in long lines before they could vote. There were some scary parts too. There were car bombs at one place where people were supposed to vote. Car bombs are very dangerous and can hurt people but thankfully, no one got hurt. To stop any kind of cheating during voting, special cards and machines were used. But these new machines made the voting process a bit slow. But the officials said that everyone who wanted to vote can vote, even if it takes all day and night. This election was important because Nigeria has had some difficult times because of violence and people not getting along. The results of this vote could change a lot of things. It's a bit like when we decide on a new game to play, it could change the way we all play together. Also, a bad group called Boko Haram has been causing trouble in the country and the current president, Mr. Jonathan, has been criticized for not being able to stop them. So, people's votes might also be influenced by how they feel about that. It's just like when you choose to play with the kid who promises to stop the school bully. Lastly, this is one of the first times that the opponent, Mr. Buhari, has a good chance of winning against the current president. So everyone is really interested to see what happens and hoping that all goes peacefully. Just like how you sometimes root for the underdog in a race, this election shows that sometimes, things can get quite exciting and unexpected!"},{"question":"Give stream of consciousness and then the final answer.

Larger moons formed in the same debris ring may have crashed into Mars. The moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, may be the only survivors of a giant impact that created many short-lived, but now-absent moons around the Red Planet, a new study finds. Phobos and Deimos are both small for moons — about 14 and 7.7 miles (22.5 and 12.4 kilometers) wide, respectively — and sort of potato-shaped. Compared to other satellites in the solar system, they look more like asteroids. As a result, astronomers previously hypothesized that these moons were asteroids captured by Mars' gravitational pull. But if that were the case, previous research suggested that Phobos and Deimos would have relatively irregular orbits. In reality, these moons have nearly circular orbits positioned near the Martian equator. [Photos of Mars' Moon Phobos Up Close] This diagram shows the collision model for the formation of Mars' two moons. A giant collision (top left) creates a disk of material around Mars (top right), and large moons emerge from the disk of material. More moons form. Eventually, the large moons fall back into Mars, and two small moons remain. Credit: A. Trinh - Royal Observatory of Belgium Another possible origin story for the Martian moons is that they coalesced from the debris of a giant impact, similar to the one largely thought to have formed Earth's moon. This rubble would have first formed a ring around Mars, and as moons emerged from this ring, they would have ended up with similarly circular orbits. However, this possibility raises the question of why Mars would end up with two moons instead of a single moon like Earth did, according to the new research paper. To learn more about the potential origins of Phobos and Deimos,study lead author Pascal Rosenblatt, lead author on the new study, and a planetary scientist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels, and his colleagues investigated scenarios \\"left on the side until now,\\" Rosenblatt told Space.com. \\"I rapidly discovered they were left not always for justified reasons.\\" The scientists focused on the huge impact that previous research suggested created the gigantic Borealis basin in the northern lowlands of Mars, which covers two-fifths of the Red Planet's surface. Prior work suggested that this basin is an impact crater, created when an impactor about 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) wide struck Mars, generating a ring of debris around the Red Planet with a mass of about 110 quadrillion tons (100 quadrillion metric tons), or about 10,000 times the combined mass of Phobos and Deimos. The research team's computer models suggested that, over time, in the inner part of this debris ring where the rubble was most densely packed, large moons up to hundreds of miles in diameter would have clumped or accreted together. In contrast, in the outer part of the debris ring, dust and rocks were thinly dispersed, making it difficult for this material to accrete into moons. However, the scientists found that gravitational tugs from one or more large moons from the inner debris ring could have stirred up rubble in the outer ring, shepherding rock and dust to form smaller outer moons, such as Phobos and Deimos. The researchers calculated that after about 5 million years, Mars' gravitational pull would have doomed the other moons, sending them crashing to the Red Planet's surface and leaving Phobos and Deimos as the sole survivors. \\"Our results pave a new path to re-understand the Martian system in a context of formation similar but not identical to [that of] our own moon,\\" Rosenblatt told Space.com. After a large moon forms from the disk of material around Mars (following a collision with a second body), the gravitational influence of that large body spurs the formation of smaller moons, like Phobos and Deimos. Credit: Labex UnivEarths / Université Paris Diderot If a giant impact did create the Martian moons and the Borealis basin, that might help explain many other aspects of early Martian history, such as how Mars got its current rate of spin and lost its atmosphere and surface water, Rosenblatt said. Although the orbit of Deimos is stable, previous research found that Phobos will one day crash against Mars as well. Indeed, a 2015 study found that Phobos already has stretch marks from the Red Planet's gravitational pull. This model suggests that Phobos and Deimos are composed of a mix of material from Mars and the impactor that created the Borealis basin. Future research can test this model by returning samples from Phobos or Deimos to Earth for study, Rosenblatt said. He noted that Japan's space agency, JAXA, and the European Space Agency (ESA) are considering missions to these moons that \\"could be launched as soon as 2022 or 2024.\\" The scientists detailed their findings online July 4 in the journal Nature Geoscience. Follow Charles Q. Choi on Twitter @cqchoi. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebookand Google+. ||||| Mars is a planet of outsized splendor. Despite being only half as big and a tenth as heavy as Earth, it bears the solar system’s tallest mountain, longest canyon and largest crater. At 22 and 12 kilometers wide, however, its inner moon Phobos and outer moon Deimos are figurative small potatoes. Scientists suspect both formed much as Earth’s single large moon did, from a massive debris disk ejected into orbit by a giant impact eons ago. But if Mars’s moons formed like Earth’s, why are they so very much smaller? The answer may be that they did not form alone. New simulations from Pascal Rosenblatt of the Royal Observatory of Belgium and colleagues show how the debris disk from a giant impact on Mars could have generated additional moons a few hundreds of kilometers in size. After forming in the dense inner regions of the disk, those larger moons would have stirred the disk’s sparser outer reaches, allowing smaller companions like Phobos and Deimos to coalesce from the ripples. The study appears in the journal Nature Geoscience. [Rosenblatt et al., Accretion of Phobos and Deimos in an extended debris disc stirred by transient moons] In this scenario, the reason we only see Phobos and Deimos today is that the bigger moons were destroyed a few million years after their formation. Their low, fast orbits outpaced Mars’s rotation, creating a tidal pull that sent them spiraling down to crash into the planet (Earth’s moon, by contrast, orbited slower than our planet’s rotation, allowing it to spiral outward and survive). Future investigations could test the new hypothesis by looking for clusters of Martian craters produced by the infalling moons, but in the meantime, proof that Mars can kill its companions is right before our eyes: The orbit of Deimos is stable, but Phobos is in a death spiral, losing two centimeters of altitude per year to Mars’s tidal pull. It will plunge into the planet in 20 [million] to 40 million years, leaving lonely, far-out Deimos as the last vestige of what may have been a once-mighty system of Martian moons. —Lee Billings [The above text is a transcript of this podcast.] [Scientific American is part of Springer Nature.] ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"The two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, may have been formed from a debris ring around the planet following a gigantic impact that has created many short-lived but now-absent moons around Mars.

I remember I sucked at the ring game and I had to pay my brother to win me a freaking doll. I remember I had a 5 finger discount on another gigantic doll and that's about it. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively? OPTIONS: (i) negative (ii) positive","response":"Based on the details provided in the review, it seems more likely that this review was given in a negative tone rather than a positive one. Here's the reasoning behind this assessment: 1. The reviewer mentions \\"only played games\\" instead of staying at the place. This statement implies that the experience didn't meet the full expectations, suggesting a less than satisfactory encounter. 2. The reviewer says they \\"sucked at the ring game,\\" which carries a negative connotation. Admitting to not being good at the game showcases frustration and dissatisfaction in competing. 3. The fact that the reviewer had to \\"pay\\" their brother to win a doll also suggests negative feelings towards the game. This detail showcases that the reviewer themselves could not win the prize and had to resort to enlisting a sibling for help, which may also impart disappointment or irritation. 4. The use of the term \\"freaking\\" when describing the doll demonstrates annoyance or exasperation. The choice of this adjective indicates a level of dissatisfaction with the outcome. 5. Lastly, the admission of having a \\"5 finger discount\\" on another gigantic doll indicates that dishonest means were employed to obtain the item. This action could be a result of dissatisfaction with the overall experience, which pushed the reviewer to carry out a negative action rather than genuinely enjoy or appreciate the offerings at the location. In summary, due to the prevalence of negative experiences shared and the dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer, it's clear that the review is written in a negative tone rather than a positive one. This makes option (i) negative the correct choice."},{"question":"Title: Stop screwing the fans please.

Its neighbours are Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Although the United States is a big country, it is not the largest in the world. In 1964, its population was over 185,000,000. When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these states were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars. In 1959, however, two more stars were added to the flag, representing the new states of Alaska and Hawaii. Indians were the first people of the land which is now the United States. There are still many thousands of Indians now living in all parts of the country. Sometimes it is said that the Indians are \\"the only real Americans\\". Most Americans come from all over the world. Those who came first in greatest numbers to make their homes on the eastern coast of North America were mostly from England. It is for that reason that the official language of the United States is English and that its culture and customs are more like those of England than those of any other country in the world.

Reasoning: The context provided in the question describes a place where residents socialize, play dice, and smoke, which indicates a location where people live. Among the options provided, an 'apartment building' is the most suitable as it consists of multiple dwelling units and is meant for residential purposes. Locations like airports, stairwells, oceans, and casinos do not typically serve as residential areas. While a stairwell could be located within an apartment building, it's not a place where people live but rather a means to navigate through levels."},{"question":"Humans have just discovered the ability to asexually reproduce if they wish. Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis. Jimmy was born by sexual reproduction and one of his parents has the same genetic disease as Billy's parents. Which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis? A:","response":"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Step 1: Understand the differences between asexual and sexual reproduction. - Asexual reproduction: Offspring are produced by a single parent and inherit all their traits from that single parent. - Sexual reproduction: Offspring are produced by the combination of genetic material from two parents, resulting in a mix of inherited traits from both parents. Step 2: Analyze the given information. - Billy: Born by asexual reproduction. Parent has Horkrumatis. As he inherits all traits from the single parent, this includes the genetic disease. - Jimmy: Born by sexual reproduction. One parent has Horkrumatis. Jimmy's chance of inheriting the disease depends on the pattern of inheritance of the disease, but generally, his risk of having it is reduced because he also inherits traits from the other parent who doesn't have the disease. Step 3: Determine which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis. As Billy has inherited all his traits from his parent with Horkrumatis, he has a higher chance of having the disease. In contrast, Jimmy has a lower chance because he derives genes from both parents, which serves to dilute the risk of carrying the genetic disease, assuming that it is a recessive trait. If the disease is dominant, the risk of having the Horkrumatis disease in sexual reproduction will depend on the carrier status of both parents. Therefore, Jimmy (born by sexual reproduction) is less likely to have Horkrumatis compared to Billy (born by asexual reproduction)."},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Too much exercise can lead to health\\" - Sentence B: \\"Too much exercise can lead to injury\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","response":"After analyzing both sentences, it is evident that Sentence A is nonsensical. Here is a detailed explanation: - Sentence A: \\"Too much exercise can lead to health\\" This sentence claims that an excessive amount of exercise will result in improved health, which is counterintuitive and nonsensical. Engaging in excessive exercise can lead to various health problems, including overuse injuries, hormonal imbalances, and weakened immune systems. It's important to strike a balance between exercising regularly to maintain good health and avoiding overdoing it, which can result in negative health consequences. - Sentence B: \\"Too much exercise can lead to injury\\" This sentence makes logical sense. Overexertion and excessive exercise can cause physical injuries, such as stress fractures, tendonitis, or sprains. When people push their bodies too hard or fail to allow sufficient recovery time, they may put themselves at higher risk of injury. This statement is consistent with general understanding and health recommendations. In conclusion, Sentence A is nonsensical, as it contradicts the widely accepted understanding that excessive exercise can lead to health problems rather than improved health."},{"question":"What's an example of a movie review?","response":"As an AI, I am unable to watch movies or form opinions, but I can create a sample movie review for you.

Eurydice was a beautiful nymph, and her love story with Orpheus is one of the most famous and tragic tales in ancient Greek literature and art. Orpheus was a legendary poet and musician, who possessed the power to enchant all living things and even inanimate objects through his beautiful music. He was the son of the muse Calliope and the Thracian king Oeagrus or, in some accounts, the god Apollo. According to the myth, Orpheus fell deeply in love with the beautiful Eurydice, and the couple got married soon after. Sadly, their happiness was short-lived. On their wedding day, Eurydice was pursued by a shepherd named Aristaeus, who was infatuated with her. While trying to escape from him, Eurydice stepped upon a venomous snake, which bit her on the foot, causing her death. She was then taken to the realm of the dead, ruled by Hades and his queen, Persephone. Inconsolable and determined to bring Eurydice back to life, Orpheus decided to undertake the dangerous journey into the Underworld. Armed with his magical lyre, he ventured into the dark realm and used his extraordinary musical talent to enchant the guardians of the Underworld, such as Cerberus, the three-headed dog, and even the boatman Charon, who ferried the souls of the dead across the river Styx. As Orpheus reached the throne of Hades and Persephone, he played his most poignant and beautiful songs, which moved the god and goddess to tears. They were so moved by his music that they agreed to allow Eurydice to return to the world of the living, under one strict condition: Orpheus must not look back at his wife as they ascended from the Underworld, or else she would be lost to him forever. Orpheus, guided by faith and love, began his ascent back to the surface, accompanied by Eurydice. However, as they were near the exit, he was overcome by the fear and uncertainty that he couldn't hear his beloved wife's footsteps behind him. In a moment of weakness, he turned back to look at her, breaking the agreement he had made with Hades and Persephone. As a result, Eurydice was instantly pulled back into the Underworld, this time permanently. Heartbroken and devastated, Orpheus could not bear to descend again and try to regain his wife. He wandered the earth for some time, playing mournful songs and losing the joy he once had in life. Eventually, he met a violent end at the hands of the Maenads, the frenzied female followers of the god Dionysus, who tore him apart in a fit of madness. Eurydice's tragic story has been retold and adapted in various forms throughout history, including operas, ballets, and poems. The tale of Orpheus and Eurydice remains a poignant exploration of love, loss, and the power of art to evoke and transcend human emotions."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text.

Instead, the simplest case can be described by focusing on a single ISP with just one point of presence connecting to an upstream provider. Here's a detailed explanation of the simplest case: The simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP involves an Internet Service Provider (ISP) having only one Point of Presence (PoP) connecting to a single upstream ISP for their internet connectivity. In this scenario, the smaller ISP (also known as a downstream ISP) relies on a larger, upstream ISP to provide them with access to the global internet and to route their traffic accordingly. The connection between the two ISPs is typically established through a dedicated, high-speed physical link, such as a fiber optic cable. This enables the smaller ISP to extend its network coverage and offer its subscribers internet access. The relationship between the two ISPs is often governed by a contractual agreement known as a peering or transit agreement. These agreements outline the commercial terms, technical specifications, and service level agreements (SLAs) necessary for the ISPs to interconnect and exchange traffic efficiently. In the simplest case, the smaller ISP does not have multiple PoPs, nor does it have connections to multiple upstream ISPs. Instead, it relies solely on the single upstream ISP for its entire internet connectivity, making it vulnerable to potential issues related to the performance or reliability of the upstream ISP's network. The arrangement also limits the smaller ISP's control and flexibility in managing its traffic flow and routing decisions since they depend largely on their upstream provider. Moreover, it may affect the smaller ISP's ability to negotiate competitive service rates and terms due to the lack of alternatives. In summary, the simplest case of an ISP using an upstream ISP involves a downstream ISP having just one point of presence, which is connected to a single upstream ISP for its global internet connectivity. This arrangement is characterized by a direct physical connection and a contractual relationship between the ISPs, but it may expose the smaller ISP to potential risks related to network reliability, performance, and limited control over routing decisions."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: Oct. 15, 2014 file photo of former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in New Hampshire and Nov. 20, 2014 file photo of former Florida Gov.

Moore, Jr., R.I.P. ARE MITT AND JEB GETTING READY TO RUMBLE? When Jeb Bush jumped in the presidential pond, it was widely assumed that it would mean the end of speculation about a possible third run for Mitt Romney. But not only has Romney continued to entertain pleas from advisers to run again, according to two senior staffers from Romney’s 2012 campaign, Bush’s exploratory move hasn’t changed the landscape for Romney that much. Romney huddled with top advisers in California on Wednesday, a group that reportedly was to include big names like Ben Ginsberg, Andrea Saul and Lanhee Chen. While we can’t know exactly what was said, top aides who spoke to Fox News First prior to the conclave said that Bush’s build-out isn’t a factor. One said that Bush and Romney were “fishing in different pools” of donors and could both proceed with explorations. The other pointed out that not even Bush would be likely to equal Romney’s potential fundraising haul. By continuing to entertain the entreaties of an increasingly enthusiastic circle of advisers, though, Romney is putting himself on a collision course with Bush. There may be enough money for both of them, but not enough votes. A shot across the bow? - Politico reports that former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., is preparing to release a decade or more of personal tax returns. While others say such a bold move is “grossly premature,” there’s no doubt that Bush will be expansive in his disclosures. If and when such a move happens it is seen by many as an early way to distance himself from 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney who came under fire for such a limited release of his own returns. Romney’s first release came in late January 2012 after the undisclosed returns helped cost him the South Carolina primary. Another release came in late September 2012, a few weeks after the Republican Convention. Romney refused to go further, but offered a summary of information from the previous 20 years as prepared by Pricewaterhouse Coopers. BAIER TRACKS: PERRY 2.0… “Outgoing Texas Gov.

Scott Walker wasn’t just Twitter trolling his potential 2016 GOP presidential rivals on Wednesday. Walker has brought aboard one of the most sought-after presidential strategists for this cycle, Rick Wiley. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last week, Walker suggested for his potential presidential run he would hire someone he knew but had not worked closely with. Wiley fits that bill. Wiley, who is based in Austin, Texas, served as the political director and later executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, and then went on to serve in a top position in Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign. From there, Wiley went to work for the Republican National Committee, eventually serving as political director. Most recently, as a consultant with Washington, D.C.-based Mercury Public Affairs, Wiley served as a liaison for the Republican Governors Association, helping Walker and other GOP candidates around the country in last fall's elections.” JERRY JONES GUSHES OVER CHRISTIE: ‘I WANT THAT ORANGE SWEATER’ Dallas Morning News: “Jerry Jones was talking about Chris Christie’s mojo again on Wednesday. The Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager said he will do everything in his power to have the New Jersey governor with him Sunday in Green Bay. ‘Yes he will [be there], if I’ve got anything to do about it, and I’m going to try to have a lot to do about it,’ Jones said during an ESPN interview. ‘I want that orange sweater, and we want him there. We’ve had him in the locker room. It feels good to have him here. We do need all hands on deck to even come close to these Packers. If he’s got enough mojo to pull this thing off for this Cowboys team this year, I’m for him being the President of the United States.’” [Christie is expected to be in attendance at Gov.

Chris Christie’s [R-N.J.] re-election campaign for documents relating to government meetings that were allegedly canceled with Jersey City’s mayor after he declined to endorse the governor, according to people familiar with the matter.” No huddle offense? - WaPo: “Jeb Bush’s … aggressive entrance in the race has sped up the timing of New Jersey Gov.

But many are also making quieter, serious investments in pursuit of small online donors, a group that, for the first time, could play a major role in deciding the GOP's presidential primary…The GOP has put a new emphasis on improving its digital game, especially its email fundraising, and more of the party's donors are giving online than ever before. Republicans have traditionally done a good job collecting small donations via direct mail, but email is many times cheaper. On top of that, an early start building an email list may be critical for whoever actually wins the nomination. None of this is lost on high-profile GOP hopefuls including Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who are already laying the groundwork to cash in on the growing pool of digital donations.” Carson insider blames publisher for plagiarism - National Review: “Ben Carson was “blindsided” by the plagiarism allegations leveled against him on Wednesday by BuzzFeed, a source close to the neurosurgeon tells National Review Online. The source says that Carson and his wife, Candy, who worked with him on the 2012 book America the Beautiful, ‘did everything they needed to do to tell the publisher what needed to be attributed.’” MCCONNELL: WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYING THREAT FROM ISLAMIST MILITANTS Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday’s attack in Paris by Islamist militants shows that terrorism is a “long-term problem” and that the administration’s “downplaying the significance of this whole terrorist threat against the Western world” doesn’t help. Asked on “The Kelly File” about White House’s initial ambivalence to call the onslaught a terrorist attack and whether there is a conscious decision not to link these types of attacks to Islam, McConnell told Megyn Kelly, “They refuse to call these attacks what they are.” “These are terrorist attacks invariably spawned by some perverted notion of Islam and to not call it what it is strikes me as not being forthcoming with the American people” Watch the interview here. [Watch the second part of McConnell’s interview on “The Kelly File” tonight at 9 p.m. ET] Unhappy precedent - David Harsanyi at The Federalist: “After the horrific and deadly terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, France, it’s worth remembering again that there is no conciliatory rhetoric or kowtowing that will stop attacks on our liberal values. They won’t stop even if we give in, which is something we’ve done. It’s something we do quite often. Surely you remember that the “Innocence of Muslims” fiasco didn’t end in Egypt. U.S. taxpayers paid for television ads in Pakistan featuring footage of Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during press a press conference – subtitled in Urdu – condemning the film. ‘We absolutely reject its content and message,’ Clinton explained. Bro-ster Tommy Vietor, then spokesman for the National Security Council, told the Washington Post that the White House has ‘reached out to YouTube to call the video to their attention and ask them to review whether it violates their terms of use.’ And due to this pressure – what amounts to no less than de facto censorship – YouTube pulled the video. The man ended up in prison and the extremists won.” A pox on media mice - Peter Beinart at The Atlantic: “But because these assaults aim to intimidate movie studios and journalists, their impact cannot be measured merely by how governments respond. Historically, terrorists and dictators have often used violence to blackmail democratic governments into changing policy. Now they are using violence to blackmail editors and studio heads into doing so. Which means that journalists and media executives, rather than merely politicians, must choose either appeasement or defiance. By first refusing to disseminate The Interview, and then agreeing to, Sony pivoted from the former to the latter. With most of its staff murdered, Charlie Hebdo itself may, tragically, not have the choice. But in deciding whether to show the images that seem to have gotten Charlie Hebdo’s cartoonists and editors killed, countless other magazines, newspapers, websites, and television networks will be acting as either hawks or doves.” WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… Today would have been Elvis Presley’s 80th birthday and one might wonder what the King of Rock and Roll would be like today had he not died in August 1977 at age 42. Well, consider this: On December 4, 1956 there was an impromptu jam session at Sun Records Memphis studios included Elvis and three other rockabilly pioneers: Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Louis. That session and the famous photo of the four would come to be known as the Million Dollar Quartet. So to guess where The King would be today we can look at what became of the other three, who shared similar backgrounds and sadly, similar demons. Perkins, with the help of Cash, eventually confronted his alcoholism and, after a career tailspin died at age 65, esteemed by all of rock and country music as a legend. Cash has one of the best known stories of loss, redemption and love, written with his beloved wife, June Carter Cash. The Man in Black, who died at 71 in 2003, was still recording and innovating up until the end. The last rockabilly still rocking though is The Killer. Jerry Lee Louis is the subject of new book from Rick Bragg and the author makes it clear that Louis is still struggling with the same tempestuous soul that churned within him even on the day he stood with those three other giants.

House Republican leaders huddled with rank and file Wednesday in Washington to develop strategies to block the president’s executive action granting temporary amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. The Hill: “Gathered in the Capitol office of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy [R-Calif.], the Republicans discussed a handful of different GOP proposals designed to prevent Obama’s order from taking effect. Emerging from that meeting, the lawmakers said they haven’t settled on a final design surrounding either the policy or the strategy for moving the language through the lower chamber. But they said they made enough progress that they hope to vote on the measure next week as part of a larger package funding the Department of Homeland Security [DHS] beyond February.” [Byron York takes a look at the two GOP plans to put a stop to President Obama’s immigration actions.] EPA delays coal war salvo - AP: “The Obama administration on Wednesday said it would delay for months a final rule to control carbon dioxide emissions at new coal-fired power plants, thwarting for now one way the Republican-controlled Congress could have blocked the administration’s plans on global warming. A final rule was due by law on Jan. 8, a year after it was first proposed. But the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it would wait until midsummer, and issue the new power plant rules with a separate regulation aimed at cutting the pollution blamed for global warming from the existing coal-fired power fleet. That would put the rule weeks past the deadline set by President Barack Obama when he announced his second-term plans for climate in June 2013…Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [R-Ky.] has vowed to overturn the emissions rules in short order to halt what he views as a war on coal, an industry important to his state but in decline there.” States will be forced to comply - NYT: “The Environmental Protection Agency will force states to comply with a federal “model rule” to cut their carbon emissions if the states do not submit customized plans under the Obama administration’s new climate change regulations, a senior official said Wednesday.” A.G. confirmation hearings set - Politico:“Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley [R-Iowa] plans to hold confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch in the last week of January or the beginning of February, an aide said Wednesday. ‘He has spoken with the White House Counsel about this goal, and the White House was agreeable to this timetable,’ Grassley’s spokeswoman, Beth Levine, said in an email. The nomination of Lynch, who was chosen late last year to replace outgoing attorney general Eric Holder, will be one of the highest profile confirmations that the new GOP majority in the Senate will take up early this year.” Reid ramps up for 2016 challenge - The Hill: “Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s [D-Nev.] chief of staff David Krone is stepping down although he will still advise Reid, according to a source familiar with the staff shakeup. The source said Krone will be replaced by Drew Willison, a longtime senior aide to Reid who recently served as Senate Sergeant-at-Arms. The source added that Krone ‘will have a major role’ on Reid’s re-election campaign. The move dovetails with Reid’s plans to run for re-election in 2016 because Willison oversaw important legislative projects for Nevada while serving as a senior aide on the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee…” THE JUDGE’S RULING: Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano illustrates how over the past 100 years the country has been on a slow steady march toward the federal destruction of the presumption of liberty: “…on the transcendental issues of our day -- life, liberty, war and debt -- the leadership of both political parties and the behavior of all modern presidents have revealed a steadfast willingness to write any law and regulate any behavior or permit any evil, whether authorized by the Constitution or not.” WARREN AIMS TO SHAPE DEBATE AS 2016 RACE BEGINS AP: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] on Wednesday hammered Washington's leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, for failing to help middle-class workers since the 1980s. Left unsaid: That time period includes President Bill Clinton's administration. As Warren continues to insist she won't run for president, and all of politics is waiting for Hillary Rodham Clinton to announce her candidacy, it was a notable omission during Warren's speech at a conference sponsored by the AFL-CIO. Bill Clinton famously declared ‘the era of big government is over’ in 1996, and Warren's indictment of three decades of economic policy referenced complaints among liberals that the policies of Democrats contributed to Wall Street excess in the past decade…That sort of rhetoric has some liberals pining for Warren to enter the Democratic presidential contest, a move that would likely pit her against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the party's leading contender should she enter the campaign as is widely expected.” Podesta gets ready for Hillary kick off - WaPo: “White House counselor John Podesta will leave the White House next month, according to a senior administration official, and will help Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential bid… Clinton is likely to announce her intention to seek the Oval Office this spring, according to her advisers and Democratic strategists.” ARCH A. MOORE, JR., R.I.P. Ed. note: It was my great privilege, sometimes frustration and always fascination to cover former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore. When I came to know and ultimately befriend the former three-term Republican governor, he was seeking the restoration of his law license following completion of his sentence for corruption charges. While I thought Moore’s admirers quite right that what he had done to keep his political machine going was less bad than many Democrats had gotten away with, I resented the argument that West Virginia should somehow accept a lower threshold for public corruption. But at least he did not steal from the public. His crimes were rooted in ambition, not greed or weakness – and there was no denying that his ambition was tied to a deep love for the state I adore. Arch was, like all of us, a complicated contradiction. What made us friends, though, was that he loved and understood politics more than almost anyone I had ever known. In hour after hour of phone calls, even at 75, he was scalpel-sharp and crackling with energy. Arch lived to see his daughter elected in a landslide to the Senate and his beloved West Virginia awash in a sea of red in November, ending finally the New Deal Democrat coalition that ruled the state for four generations. It would have surely pleased him, but I doubt it would have surprised him. He could see around corners better than most of us. As to why I ultimately came to admire him, it was his refusal to be defeated. He was truly a brave man. So he should probably be best remembered not for what he did in office or politics but for what he did before he ever won his first vote: Charleston Daily Mail: “In November 1944, during a battle near Aachen, Germany, a machine-gun bullet hit Moore, then an infantry sergeant, in the face. It broke his jaw and almost severed his tongue. ‘Moore lay on the soggy, wintry-cold German beet field, with his face torn apart and severe blood loss, for several hours that day,’ according to his biography. ‘At some point, his two decades of life flashed in front of him, as if he was going to die.’ That day, 33 of the 36 men in his platoon were killed. Several oral and facial surgeries later, Moore spent the better part of a year learning how to speak again.” Rest in peace, Governor. Thank you for your service.

Question: suppose a person is less careful happens, how will it affect there will be more toxins. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"A: More When a person is less careful with their hygiene and health habits, they may be more susceptible to bacterial infections. This is because they may not be taking the necessary precautions to prevent exposure to harmful bacteria, such as washing their hands, maintaining cleanliness, and avoiding contact with sick individuals or contaminated surfaces. As a result, more bacteria might enter the body. When there is an increased presence of bacteria in the body, these microorganisms begin to divide and grow rapidly. The uncontrolled growth of bacteria takes away resources from other cells, making it harder for them to function properly. Consequently, the person starts to feel unwell. As bacteria continue to multiply, they produce toxins as a byproduct of their growth and division. These toxins can harm the body in various ways, such as damaging tissues, causing inflammation, or disrupting the normal functioning of cells. With more bacteria and higher levels of toxins in the body, the immune system attempts to respond and combat the invasion. The body's natural defenses, such as white blood cells, become more active in an effort to eliminate the harmful bacteria and neutralize the toxins. This immune response can sometimes cause a person to feel even more unwell, as it may lead to symptoms like fever, fatigue, pain, and inflammation. In summary, when a person is less careful with their hygiene and health habits, they are more likely to be exposed to bacteria, leading to an increased presence of bacterial toxins in the body. This situation often causes the person to feel unwell and can lead to various symptoms and health issues, depending on the type and severity of the bacterial infection. Therefore, the answer is A: more toxins."},{"question":"Deshalb können wir diese Auslegung des Grundsatzes der relativen Stabilität nicht unterstützen.

En esta frase, estamos hablando de ofrecer un viaje compartido desde Padova, una ciudad ubicada en la provincia de Padua, Italia, hasta Exincourt, una localidad en Francia. El viaje compartido, también conocido como \\"carpooling\\" o \\"auto compartido\\", es una práctica cada vez más popular en la que varias personas viajan juntas en un solo vehículo, con el fin de compartir los gastos y reducir la congestión del tráfico. Por lo general, el conductor y los pasajeros se turnan para conducir sus propios vehículos en diferentes días de la semana o en diferentes momentos del día, lo que permite a todos compartir el costo del combustible, peajes y estacionamiento, así como reducir el desgaste de sus vehículos. En un contexto más amplio, el viaje compartido puede ser una alternativa al transporte público para aquellas personas que necesitan desplazarse en áreas urbanas o rurales donde el servicio de transporte público es limitado o inexistente. También puede ser una opción más económica y ecológica en comparación con el uso de un vehículo privado, especialmente si el conductor y los pasajeros están dispuestos a compartir el costo del alquiler de un automóvil. Los viajeros diarios, que deben desplazarse todos los días entre su hogar y el lugar de trabajo, también pueden beneficiarse del viaje compartido, ya que les permite ahorrar en gastos de transporte y, a menudo, disfrutar de una mayor comodidad que en el transporte público. Además, compartir el viaje en coche puede ser una buena oportunidad para conocer a otras personas y establecer contactos profesionales o sociales. El viaje económico (o viaje con bajo presupuesto), es otra forma de viajar donde las personas optan por métodos de transporte menos costosos, como el viaje compartido, para reducir sus costos de viaje. Este tipo de transporte puede ser especialmente atractivo para estudiantes, jóvenes y personas con un presupuesto limitado que deseen viajar largas distancias.

Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again.

Change positions and move around. Get a massage. Use hot or cold therapy. Immerse yourself in a bath or take a shower. Try a TENS unit. Article:","response":"Title: 7 Effective Techniques for Pain Relief Introduction Pain is an inevitable part of life. Whether caused by injuries, illnesses, or chronic conditions, it can be a significant source of discomfort and a major hindrance to our daily activities. With various pain management options available, from over-the-counter medications to holistic therapy, it can be overwhelming to determine the most effective way to alleviate one's suffering. In this article, we will explore seven non-pharmaceutical techniques to help ease pain and discomfort in a holistic and potentially less invasive manner. 1. Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises are known to be an effective means of managing pain, as they promote relaxation and increase oxygen levels in the bloodstream. One such exercise is deep breathing, in which you take slow, even breaths that engage your diaphragm rather than shallow breaths from your chest. By doing so, you can send a signal to your brain to release endorphins, which act as natural painkillers. Another technique is box breathing, where you inhale, hold your breath, exhale, and hold your breath again for equal counts. These exercises aim to help divert attention from pain and provide a sense of control over the situation. 2. Visualization Exercises Visualization, or guided imagery, is a technique in which you envision a positive and calming experience or environment. This approach aims to shift your focus from the pain to a more pleasant mental image, helping your body to relax and potentially experience pain relief. To practice this technique, find a quiet, comfortable space, close your eyes, and create a detailed picture in your mind's eye. You can also use an audio-guided visualization to help with this process. 3. Change Positions and Move Around Remaining still for extended periods can lead to increased pain, especially for individuals suffering from chronic pain conditions. By changing positions frequently and moving around, you help to stimulate blood circulation and reduce muscle stiffness. Stretching can also be beneficial in alleviating discomfort by promoting flexibility and muscle relaxation. 4. Get a Massage Massage therapy addresses various types of pain, including muscle aches, tension headaches, and joint pain. By targeting soft tissues and muscle groups connected to the affected area, massage can help improve blood flow, decrease inflammation, and release endorphins for pain relief. It's important to consult with a professional massage therapist to ensure appropriate techniques are used for your specific pain condition. 5. Use Hot or Cold Therapy Both heat and cold therapy can provide relief for different types of pain. Heat therapy is ideal for soothing muscle tension, stiffness, and chronic pain. Applying a heating pad, warm towel, or taking a warm bath can increase blood flow to the area, promoting healing and relaxation. Cold therapy, on the other hand, is effective in reducing inflammation and numbing acute pain from recent injury. Utilize ice packs or cold gel packs to deliver targeted relief to the affected area. 6. Immerse Yourself in a Bath or Take a Shower Similar to heat therapy, taking a warm bath or shower can help alleviate muscle aches, pains, and stiffness. Adding Epsom salts or essential oils, such as lavender, can also contribute to a more relaxing, therapeutic experience. Additionally, hydrotherapy – utilizing water's properties for therapeutic purposes – can aid in relieving pain through buoyancy, providing a weightless environment that relieves pressure on joints and muscles. 7. Try a TENS Unit Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive, drug-free method of pain relief that uses mild electrical currents to interrupt pain signals, stimulating endorphin production. This approach can be particularly helpful for individuals dealing with chronic pain conditions or acute pain from an injury. Consult with a healthcare professional before using a TENS unit to ensure it is appropriate for your specific needs. Conclusion While these techniques can help manage pain, it's essential to recognize that each individual has different needs and experiences with pain. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your particular situation. Incorporating one or more of these approaches into your pain relief routine can contribute to a more balanced and holistic approach to managing and alleviating pain."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the intention of the PersonX from the Head or not. The intention is the likely intent or desire of PersonX behind the execution of an event. For example, given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Q: Head: PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>Tail: to receive PersonY's letter A:","response":"Part #1: Understanding the given phrases 'Head' and 'Tail' and the relationship between them. Usage: An example is provided in the task description: \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\". Here, 'Head' is \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter\\", and 'Tail' is \\"to receive PersonY's letter\\". The task is about figuring out if the action described in 'Tail' is a likely intention of 'PersonX' based on the 'Head'. It becomes clear that the 'PersonX' answered the letter of 'PersonY' not with the intention of receiving PersonY's letter because the PersonX has already received the letter. Part #2: Replacing the names of specific people with generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). Usage: In \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\", 'PersonX' and 'PersonY' are generic replacements for specific people. By avoiding names, we ensure the task focuses on deducing intention from action, not from personal characteristics or relationship dynamics between specific persons. Part #3: Understanding that PersonX is always the subject of the event. Usage: In \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\", 'PersonX' is the one performing the action, and thus is the subject. Part #4: Understanding the 'intention' of PersonX based on the 'head' phrase. Usage: The task explanation provides an example of what an intention could be: \\"given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful\\". Part #5: Classifying the answers. Usage: The result of the task must be classified into \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", indicating whether the 'Tail' is likely the intention of the 'PersonX' from the 'Head' phrases or not. For \\"PersonX answers PersonY's letter<sep>to receive PersonY's letter\\", the answer would be \\"No\\", as it's not likely to be the intention. Part #6: Understanding what the placeholder \\"___\\" can represent. Usage: While there is no explicit use of \\"___\\" in the provided example, it might appear in other samples. \\"___\\" could represent a missing part of the sentence that can be an object, a person and/or an action. For example, it could be something like \\"PersonX visits ___\\", where '___' can be replaced with PersonY's house, an action like a 'restaurant', or other nouns."},{"question":"If He also encouraged researchers to continue publishing in journals about their own areas of expertise., can we conclude that \\"The man loves to read the fruits of their minds. \\"?","response":"Step 1: Analyze the given statement The given statement is \\"He also encouraged researchers to continue publishing in journals about their own areas of expertise.\\" This suggests that the man supports ongoing research and appreciates researchers' contributions.

Here's why: Premise: \\"Two people are reading something while sitting on a bench.\\" This statement tells us that there are two people who are reading. However, it does not specify what they are reading. It could be books, newspapers, or even their phones. Hypothesis: \\"Two people read books while waiting on a bench.\\" This statement assumes that the two people are reading books and that they are waiting for something.

Rule out unrelated options: A shopping bag is a temporary storage for items during shopping and not a specific location for storing tins. Therefore, we can eliminate the shopping bag as an option. 3. Consider relevant options: A kitchen, hardware store, grocery store, and cupboard are all relevant places where a tin may be stored. 4. Analyze the remaining options according to their specific purpose: a. Kitchen: A kitchen is a place where food is prepared and cooked. It may have tins that are being used for cooking or eating. b. Hardware store: A hardware store primarily focuses on selling tools and materials for home improvement and construction. It is unlikely to store food-related items like tins. c.

Sometimes I woke and there was a big figure looking down at me. Sometimes in the early morning I heard the closing of the front door and the sound of shoes walking down.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who were the two replacements assigned to the 4077? Title: MASH Movie plot: The plot is told as a series of (presumably chronological) vignettes surrounding the life of the namesake Mobile Army Surgical Hospital where it is set. While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Other characters arrive after Hawkeye and Duke, and become integrated into camp life, such as surgeon Trapper John and Nurse Margaret Houlihan. After the characters are introduced, which forms the opening act, further comedic episodes explore the evolving relationships between the characters.

The Central Intelligence Agency were critical of the move, believing that Syria were a greater threat and that an attack would strengthen Gaddafi's reputation; however Libya was recognised as a \\"soft target.\\" Reagan was supported by the U.K. but opposed by other European allies, who argued that it would contravene international law. In Operation El Dorado Canyon, orchestrated on 15 April 1986, U.S. military planes launched a series of air-strikes on Libya, bombing military installations in various parts of the country, killing around 100 Libyans, including several civilians. One of the targets had been Gaddafi's home. Himself unharmed, two of Gaddafi's sons were injured, and he claimed that his four-year-old adopted daughter Hanna was killed, although her existence has since been questioned. In the immediate aftermath, Gaddafi retreated to the desert to meditate, while there were sporadic clashes between Gaddafists and army officers who wanted to overthrow the government. Although the U.S. was condemned internationally, Reagan received a popularity boost at home. Publicly lambasting U.S. imperialism, Gaddafi's reputation as an anti-imperialist was strengthened both domestically and across the Arab world, and in June 1986, he ordered the names of the month to be changed in Libya.

For the past year, the Untitled Donald Crowhurst Film has been among the buzziest titles in international markets. Directed by James Marsh (The Theory of Everything), the high-profile project from StudioCanal, BBC Films and Blueprint Pictures — which stars Colin Firth and Rachel Weisz and tells the fascinating real-life story of Crowhurst, an amateur sailor whose overly ambitious attempt to circumnavigate the globe in 1968 ended in tragedy — has, understandably, sparked a fair amount of interest. Although it's not due to hit cinemas for another year, the film finally has an official name: The Mercy. In the first-look image, released Friday, Firth, as Crowhurst, appears to look tired and unkempt on the deck of his boat, the Teignmouth Electron, which the businessman entered in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a single-handed round-the-world yacht race. Eventually, he would abandon the competition, with logs indicating that he suffered from a mental breakdown, eventually leading to his presumed suicide. Writer-director Scott Z. Burns has penned the screenplay, which is believed to be based on the 2006 documentary Deep Water. Burns is producing alongside Pete Czernin and Graham Broadbent of London-based Blueprint and Nicholas Mauvernay and Jacques Perrin of French production house Galatee Films. The project was developed by Christine Langan from BBC Films and StudioCanal. StudioCanal will release the film across its markets in 2017. No domestic distributor has been announced. ||||| Eight-year-old Simon Crowhurst huddled in a big, strange bed, listening to the waves batter the coastline while the wind moaned outside his window. His family was staying in a hotel in Teignmouth, on the southern toe of England, because tomorrow his father, Donald, was setting off to sail around the world. But as Simon listened to the weather rage, the excitement he’d felt over his father becoming a real-life adventure hero collapsed. He had seen his father’s spindly 12-metre boat, and for the first time, it occurred to him that this voyage was dangerous. Simon was terrified. In a nearby room, Donald Crowhurst’s confidence was crumbling into tearful panic as he confessed to his wife, Clare, that his boat wasn’t ready. Only later would it occur to her that he may have been begging her to tell him not to go, to give him a way out. The thought would haunt her. But at the time, even with her normally ebullient husband sobbing in front of her, she still believed he could do anything and didn’t want him to regret giving up. So Clare did for Crowhurst what she’d been doing for their children, 10-year-old James, seven-year-old Roger, five-year-old Rachel, and Simon: She stuffed her fear down deep and told him everything would be fine. The next day, Oct. 31, 1968, Simon was relieved to see the weather had calmed. His excitement returned, buoyed by the news cameras and onlookers milling around. He and his family boarded his father’s boat, the Teignmouth Electron–named as a publicity nod to the resort town from which he was sailing and his own struggling electronics business—to say goodbye. Crowhurst kissed each of his children on the forehead and told James and Simon to look after their mother. Simon would always remember the undulating sea beneath his feet as he stood on the deck of another boat with his family, watching his father and the Electron get smaller, then slip over the horizon and disappear. Donald Crowhurst, 36, was about to became a British folk hero, the middle-class family man who conquered the seas and captivated the nation. Later, he would be seen as a con man who claimed to have sailed around the globe—despite never having ventured out of the Atlantic. Ultimately, he was revealed to be the victim of a storm in his own head. His family never saw him again after his boat blinked out of sight, and it would take them years to unravel what happened to him; even now, that’s a jagged-edged question they’ve each answered in their own way. The truth about the inventor’s phony voyage can only be guessed based on the evidence he left behind. What is certain is that when Crowhurst sailed from Teignmouth, he was tragically ill-prepared, but had staked so much on the journey that the circumstances carried him away like a riptide. ||||| Summary:","response":"The Mercy, previously known as the \\"Untitled Donald Crowhurst Film\\", is a high-profile project from StudioCanal, BBC Films, and Blueprint Pictures.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Options: A. for a few hours B. for a few minutes C. not enough information D. for a few days === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"B. for a few minutes"},{"question":"What was the full name of the person who pleaded for help from the Mongol prince? Answer the above question based on the context below: When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies. Goldstein states that the government of...","response":"The full name of the person who pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan is the Fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso. Lozang Gyatso, also known as Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, was a key figure in the establishment of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism and the political unification of Tibet under the rule of the Dalai Lamas. Born in 1617, he became the leader of the Gelugpas at a time when the Gelug school faced threats from rival Tibetan Buddhist schools and political factions. As the context describes, when an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened the Gelugpas with destruction, Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from Güshi Khan, who was the leader of the Khoshut tribe of the Oirat Mongols. Güshi Khan was a prominent figure in the 17th century, leading his tribe in various military expeditions and ultimately helping the Gelugpas establish political control over Tibet. Between 1637 and 1640, Güshi Khan defeated the enemies of the Gelugpas in the Amdo and Kham regions, effectively eliminating threats to the Gelug school and solidifying its influence. At the urging of the Gelugpa regent Sonam Chöpel, Güshi Khan attacked the Ü-Tsang king's stronghold in Shigatse, successfully capturing it after a year-long siege in 1642. This event led to the execution of Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang and King of Tibet. Following the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan presented his conquest as a gift to Lozang Gyatso, the Fifth Dalai Lama, in a ceremonious event. As a result, Lozang Gyatso was enthroned as the ruler of Tibet, with Sonam Chöpel serving as the regent and holding actual governing authority. Despite being granted the title of 'King of Tibet,' Güshi Khan maintained control over the military forces and accepted a subordinate role to the Dalai Lama, displaying the strengthened collaboration between the two. The shared rule between Lozang Gyatso, Sonam Chöpel, and Güshi Khan led to the early development of both secular and religious governance in Tibet under the authority of the Dalai Lamas. Lozang Gyatso, as the Fifth Dalai Lama, expanded his authority by emphasizing lineage reincarnation, performing religious rituals, and constructing significant religious sites, such as the Potala Palace. This established the strong foundations for the political and religious institution of the Dalai Lama that persists in Tibetan Buddhism to this day."},{"question":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Paul Latour is a prisoner of war in Germany and his wife Marie lives hand-to-mouth with their two children in a squalid flat. A neighbour, whose husband is also in Germany, has fallen pregnant and is trying to lose the baby. Marie helps her, successfully. Other women come to her and she starts charging. While talking with Paul one night, she reveals that a fortune teller saw \\"nothing but good things\\" in her future, along with a lot of women, which she wouldn't clarify, but alluded to her abortion activities. Marie also confessed to wanting to be a famous singer. Despite her husbands return, she will not resume relations. She sees him as immasculated, and less than a man. Although he cannot find work, he rents a bigger flat so that the two can have some privacy. Marie not only has more space for her illicit business but lets a prostitute use a room during the day. She also starts a daytime affair with a collaborator. When one of the abortions goes wrong, the woman dies and her despairing husband commits suicide. Marie shrugs off the tragedy and hires a maid to help, suggesting that part of her duties can be to sleep with Paul. After returning home early and witnessing Marie and her lover asleep together, he sends an anonymous denunciation to the police, alerting them of her illegal activities. A recent law of the Vichy rÃ©gime, determined to enforce morality and stop population decline, has made abortion a treasonable crime. Marie is condemned to death and guillotined.

The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.

This organization of forces was due to a lack of supplies, forcing each division to seek out basic provisions along with the representatives of the army supply arm that was supposed to aid them. What made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot, commander of the 1st Division. He told General Abel Douay, commander of the 2nd Division, on 1 August that \\"The information I have received makes me suppose that the enemy has no considerable forces very near his advance posts, and has no desire to take the offensive\\". Two days later, he told MacMahon that he had not found \\"a single enemy post ... it looks to me as if the menace of the Bavarians is simply bluff\\". Even though Ducrot shrugged off the possibility of an attack by the Germans, MacMahon tried to warn the other divisions of his army, without success. Question: Whose conduct made a bad situation worse?","response":"The conduct of General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot, commander of the 1st Division, made a bad situation worse during the events leading up to the Battle of Wissembourg in the Franco-Prussian War. General Ducrot’s dismissal of the potential threat posed by enemy forces played a significant role in aggravating the already-dire circumstances. His series of communications and actions indicate a significant misreading of the enemy's intentions and capabilities. He expressed his belief to General Abel Douay, commander of the 2nd Division, on 1st August that the Prussian incursion wasn't a pressing issue. He claimed that the enemy, based on the information he had, didn't have substantial forces near their front lines and showed no desire to commence an offensive. This false assertion could have contributed to a dangerous sense of complacency within the French ranks. His convictions were further reinforced when he informed Marshal MacMahon two days later that he hadn't found a single enemy post, leading him to believe that they were merely bluffing. This blatant underestimation of the Prussian forces significantly contributed to worsening an already challenging situation. While Marshal MacMahon had a broader understanding of the potential threat and tried to alert his various divisions, it seems his warnings largely fell on deaf ears, possibly due to the persuasive assurances of General Ducrot. This series of miscalculations and underestimations, underscored by Ducrot's dismissive attitude, potentially led the French forces to be ill-prepared for the upcoming military encounter, thereby exacerbating the pre-existing supply and logistics issues that permeated the French army during the war. In this case, Ducrot’s actions had a negative impact on the overall strategic and tactical preparation of the French forces. His lack of concern over the Prussian threat failed to trigger a sense of urgency necessary for effective defense or counter-offensive strategies, effectively making a bad situation much worse."},{"question":"Based on the sentence \\"A man playing an instrument.\\", is the sentence \\"The man is sitting quietly.\\" a true sentence?","response":"Imagine you have a friend named Tommy who really loves playing his guitar.

Graves says he hasn’t thought about the chairmanship, and he may not want to leave Yorkshire having invested so much time and money into the county. .............................................................................. The FA intend to prioritise certain international tournaments in future so PL clubs know well in advance when players are needed. The PL are for once supportive of an FA policy. The clubs say the problem in the past has been the lack of information from the FA as to when players will be called up. THIN SKINNED ALLOTT. Paul Allott, mediocre presenter of Sky Sports’ Cricket Writers on TV, is ill-suited to host a show about media comment on the sport judging by his furious reaction to one sentence of negative opinion about his Lancashire board role — which also conflicts with his Sky job. Thin skinned: Sky presenter Paul Allott took exception to a question about his role on the Lancashire board. Sports Agenda reported relegation-threatened Lancashire members’ concerns that director of cricket Mike Watkinson reports on cricket matters to his close friend Allott. So when he spotted your columnist in a Lancashire VIP area during the Old Trafford Test, he demanded that security were called to remove me in such an exaggeratedly aggressive manner that even his son told him to calm down. Allott refused to accept that I had been invited into the hospitality area by one of his fellow board members until confirmed personally. Later, at an Old Trafford reception for the media, when Sports Agenda attempted to defuse the situation by asking for a quiet word with Allott, Lancashire’s equally preposterous chairman Michael Cairns said that couldn’t happen as the club lawyer wasn’t present. If Allott hadn’t been so busy enjoying himself in the Old Trafford hospitality boxes or trying to eject your columnist last Friday evening, he would have saved himself from an embarrassing altercation with fourth Test match referee Ranjan Madugalle the following morning. Embarrassing: Allott's suggestion to bring in the boundaries was given short shrift by Ranjan Madugalle (L) Allott, concerned that the drainage fiasco would continue to postpone play, went to see Madugalle to ask for the boundary ropes to be brought in. Allott was given short shrift as that option had been discounted the previous night — no changes can be made to the size of the playing area once the match has started.

In the list of possible replacements, Lord Jonathan Marland, the former Tory treasurer, has emerged as a strong contender for the position. Marland, who had previously discussed about taking up the role before Fry was appointed back in April 2013 had to step back due to numerous other business and political commitments. However, these have eased now, hence, giving Marland the opportunity to dedicate time to this key football role. Marland carries significant stature and is believed to have enough capacity to command respect among the 20 clubs in the top flight. He had previously attempted to chair the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2009 but had to back down before the vote owing to insufficient time to garner enough support. Marland had exhibited a critical view of the ECB’s handling of the rift between Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores. It's worth noting that the Premier League panel entrusted with the responsibility of finding Fry's successor will wait till chief executive Richard Scudamore fully recuperates from major heart surgery before announcing another chairman. Meanwhile, another familiar name being associated with the Premier League chairmanship is that of ex-Southampton chairman, Rupert Lowe. In other sports-related news, there is chatter that the Chairman of the ECB, Giles Clarke, may step down with Yorkshire’s Colin Graves touted as his most likely successor. But Clarke's camp has refuted this, stating that he intends to continue his tenure. Colin Graves, too, has shown little interest in the position as he doesn't wish to leave Yorkshire, where he has invested considerable time and resources. The FA is also planning to prioritize future international tournaments so Premier League clubs are aware in advance when their players will be needed. This is a policy that the PL clubs are ready to support, as they claim that the FA hasn't provided adequate information in the past regarding player allocations. Finally, a discord was noted involving Sky presenter Paul Allott who had an aggressive reaction to criticism on his Lancashire board role, which also conflicts with his role at Sky. Allott, in response to a sentence of negative opinion, demanded the removal of the author of these criticisms from a Lancashire VIP area during the Old Trafford Test. This led to an unsettling situation with the match's referee, Ranjan Madugalle."},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: it is not possible to tell","response":"Question: Is it possible to predict the exact moment when a person will make a decision? Explanation: Human decision-making is a highly complex process that involves an intricate interplay between cognitive, emotional, and contextual factors. Though we may understand some of the general principles and patterns that guide our choices, it remains a challenge to predict a person's decision with precise accuracy. Apart from the unpredictability of human emotions and individual differences, the influence of external factors, such as the environment and social interactions, further complicates the process of forecasting an individual's decisions. The innate variability and adaptability of human behavior, as well as the continuous integration of new information and experiences into our decision-making frameworks, make it virtually impossible to pinpoint the exact moment when someone will arrive at a choice."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often. It is only when we can notsee perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark. Question: We don't know that our eyes are of great importance until _ . - we think about our eyes - we cannot see clearly - we wear glasses - we have to do much reading A:","response":"We don't know that our eyes are of great importance until we cannot see clearly. The article mentions that it is only when our vision is not perfect that we realize the importance of our eyes. This can happen when people become nearsighted, farsighted or have other visual issues that affect their ability to see clearly. Wearing glasses, doing much reading, or simply thinking about our eyes do not necessarily make us realize the importance of our eyes – it is the experience of not being able to see clearly that highlights their importance in our lives."},{"question":"Callimaco is taken by the beauty of Lucrezia , but she is the loyal wife of Nicia , a rich and foolish lawyer .

The reviewer starts by expressing some initial positivity, stating that the movie \\"starts out with tremendous promise\\", and noting that it has an \\"intriguing and alluring premise\\". These comments suggest that the movie began strongly, capturing their interest and setting up what appeared to be a unique or compelling storyline. However, the subsequent part of the review turns decidedly negative. The reviewer reports that the movie falls prey to \\"a boatload of screenwriting cliches.\\" This means they observed many elements in the movie that they found overly familiar or formulaic, which is generally a negative indicator as it suggests a lack of originality or creativity on the part of the filmmakers. The use of the word \\"boatload\\" suggests a heavy presence of these cliches, as if they were noticeable throughout the film. The reviewer concludes that these cliches \\"sink it faster than a leaky freighter.\\" This metaphor paints a vivid picture of a ship sinking quickly due to a fatal flaw, which ties in with their perception that the screenwriting cliches undermine and ultimately ruin the movie. This part of the review shows a strong level of dissatisfaction, indicating that they view these cliches as serious enough to largely negate any potential positive aspects of the film. Taken as a whole, while it acknowledges some initial positive aspects, the review primarily focuses on major issues that critically weaken the film according to the reviewer's perspective, and thus can be classified as predominantly negative."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence which is either in the Hindi language or English language.

Unbeknownst to Hopkins, Sheikh Riyadh is determined to seek him out after learning about his impressive reputation. Sheikh Riyadh has been harboring a secret dream of breeding a world-class racehorse in the west that could excel against both Eastern and Western thoroughbreds. Intrigued by the Arab royals' knowledge and appreciation of horse racing, Hopkins begrudgingly agrees to visit the Sheikh's impressive stables in Dubai. Upon their arrival, Hopkins immediately discovers the Sheikh's prized possession: a promising young colt named Al-Musafir. Hopkins is initially skeptical, but the undeniably strong bond between Sheikh Riyadh and the colt catches his attention. Slowly, Sheikh Riyadh shares his wisdom and advice on horse racing with Hopkins, opening his eyes to the complex and rich history of Arabian horsemanship that has been preserved for centuries. As they hatch a plan to enter Al-Musafir into the highly competitive UK racing circuit, Hopkins and Sheikh Riyadh discover that their differences in background and experience are no match for their shared love of horse racing. Together, they form an unstoppable team, determined to prove Al-Musafir's greatness to the world. While training intensifies, Sheikh Riyadh is suddenly called away to tend to a crisis back home. Dr. Hopkins is left to continue preparing Al-Musafir for the upcoming race, unsure if Sheikh Riyadh will return in time for the crucial event.

Did Rumi spend his time in a state of euphoria?","response":"Rationale: To answer this question, we need to understand who Rumi was, his perspective on life, and whether his writings and actions suggest he spent his time in a euphoric state. Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, more commonly known as Rumi, was a 13th-century Persian poet, Islamic jurist, theologian, and Sufi mystic. He is a celebrated figure in world literature and is best known for his mystic poetry, which has been widely translated and adored, particularly in the Western world. Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam to which Rumi belonged, promotes a deep sense of connection with the divine and emphasizes the pursuit of spiritual truths, love, and self-awareness. Sufi practices often involve rituals like chanting and whirling dances known as the Sema, intended to bring participants closer to God. As for Rumi's perspective on life and his possible state of euphoria, his poetry and teachings reflect a deep sense of love, joy, and divine union. Rumi's works, like the Mathnawi and the Divan-e-Shams-e-Tabrizi, are filled with profound spiritual insights and a desire to merge with the Absolute. Rumi believed in transcending the self and the physical world to achieve mystical union with the divine. Answer: It is reasonable to infer that Rumi, through his Sufi practices and teachings, may have experienced episodes of euphoria and spiritual ecstasy. However, it's unlikely that he spent his entire time in this state, as he was an influential Islamic scholar and jurist who had worldly responsibilities as well. Rumi's writings suggest he experienced moments of profound spiritual bliss and ecstasy, but as with any human, he probably also faced challenges and had to navigate myriad emotional states throughout his life."},{"question":"Sprijin ferm o strategie care își propune să protejeze populația și să reconstruiască zonele în care este garantată securitatea, precum și soluțiile politice care invită la negocieri toate părțile implicate.

As a result, when it came to working on their team's project, it was Justin who made a lousy spreadsheet for the project. Despite their best efforts, Justin's lack of experience with Excel hindered the project's overall progress. On the other hand, Michael demonstrated expertise in the use of Excel, which often allowed him to navigate the complex software with ease and create sophisticated spreadsheets that accurately reflected their project requirements. When Michael was given the responsibility of using Excel, he could often help the team by efficiently organizing data, performing calculations, and generating informative charts that enabled them to make more informed decisions. This valuable skillset made Michael an asset to the team and greatly contributed to the overall success of the project. He could easily troubleshoot any Excel-related issue and provide assistance to other team members who might be less familiar with the software, thereby ensuring that the entire team could remain on task and stay focused on their objectives. Justin, however, struggled with Excel, and this was evident in the lousy spreadsheet he had created for the project. Instead of the clean, organized, and efficient spreadsheet that Michael would have made, Justin's attempt was riddled with errors and inconsistencies. Formatting issues, inadequate or miscalculated formulas, and improperly labeled data points all contributed to the underwhelming quality of Justin's spreadsheet. Although he may have had good intentions, Justin's lack of expertise in Excel had a detrimental impact on the project as it required additional time and resources to rectify the problems he had inadvertently introduced. The team ultimately had to call upon Michael to fix the issues in Justin's spreadsheet, which meant that Michael was required to invest valuable time and effort into correcting the errors that had been made. This was a clear indication that Justin required further training in utilizing Excel to its full potential. The team members recognized the importance of leveraging each individual's strengths and areas of expertise, and as such, they were determined to provide Justin with the necessary support and resources to improve his skills in using Excel moving forward. Ultimately, the contrasting proficiency levels in using Excel displayed by Michael and Justin served as a valuable lesson on the significance of appropriately allocating tasks within a team environment. By capitalizing on each individual's unique abilities and skill sets, the team could ensure that their projects would be managed efficiently, effectively, and reliably, leading to the overall success of their endeavors. In conclusion, while Michael excelled at using Excel and was able to create high-quality spreadsheets for the project, Justin struggled with the software, resulting in a lousy spreadsheet that subsequently demanded additional time and effort for correction. It became apparent that the team needed to focus on enhancing Justin's abilities in Excel to ensure a more successful project outcome in the future."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it! one was where a line or two from the song Don't Worry, Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin. That is it there was nothing more amusing than that, at least not for me anyway! Doctornappy2 is not right in saying 'Fans of the completely terrible \\"Shrek\\" might enjoy, but \\"Wallace & Gromit\\" fans will probably turn away in disgust.' As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get! The continuity mistakes were too big in number. Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. I won't point out all of the others, but here are a few more to see: When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. At one point the ruby falls down Roddy's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. In the next scene Roddy has caught it again. This is impossible. Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddy's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddy's hand. There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it. Too many, for want of a better word, 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole film left you wanting....wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else! Paint drying or grass growing are two superb options!","response":"The sentiment expressed in this passage is overwhelmingly negative. The author uses strong language, such as \\"rubbish,\\" \\"nothing more amusing,\\" and \\"about as far from done well as you can possibly get,\\" to convey their strong dissatisfaction with the film they are discussing.

The author goes on to point out multiple perceived problems with the film, such as continuity mistakes and repeating jokes, which they believe contribute to the overall negative sentiment.

Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory. The landscapes in the residential areas are a source of unhappiness for 43.2 percent of the respondents, and about one-third say they were \\" \\" into buying \\"third grade\\" house. And more than half are not satisfied with the sport and entertainment facilities in their neighborhood. Property management in the buildings, 56.5 percent of the respondents say, is way below standard compared to the high fee charged by the complexes. 60 percent of the consumers doubt the contents of developers' advertisements, with only 6.3 percent being satisfied. Experts have suggested consumers gather thorough knowledge about a developer and their work before deciding to buy a house from it. They should check the day-light conditions and ventilation in different weather conditions in advance, if possible. Which is the best title of the passage?

It is the fawning history of the dynasty known as the House of Barcelona . In presenting the rulers of the county of Barcelona as the descendants of Charlemagne , the monks sought to justify their independent policy with respect to the King of France , their nominal sovereign . The Gesta is the chronological backbone . The first composition was made between 1162 and 1184 and ended with the reign of Raymond Berengar IV ( 1131 -- 62 ) . In the late thirteenth century it was continued through the reign of James I ( 1213 -- 76 ) . An abridged version in the Catalan language was produced sometime between 1268 and 1283 . The final Latin version was edited in 1303 -- 14 and included the reigns of Peter the Great ( 1276 -- 87 ) , Alfonso the Generous ( 1287 -- 91 ) , and James II. Except for the first composition , all surviving versions are later copies , today preserved in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó , in the Biblioteca de Catalunya , and in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France . A copy of one of the latter was taken to France by Pierre de Marca and published in 1688 by Étienne Baluze . - The Kingdom of Aragon (, ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories the Principality of Catalonia (which included the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon. - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the \\"infanta\\" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona. - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\"). - Provence (Provençal: \\"Provença\\" in classical norm or \\"Prouvènço\\" in Mistralian norm) is a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France, which extends from the left bank of the lower Rhône River to the west to the Italian border to the east, and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It largely corresponds with the modern administrative \\"région\\" of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and includes the \\"départements\\" of Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region is Marseille. - The Principality of Catalonia, is a historic territory and a medieval and early modern political entity in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Spain, with an adjoining portion in southern France. Between the 13th and the 18th centuries it was bordered by the Kingdom of Aragon to the west, the Kingdom of Valencia to the south, the Kingdom of France and the feudal lordship of Andorra to the north and by the Mediterranean sea to the east. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The County of Barcelona was originally a frontier region under the rule of the Carolingian dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona were \\"de facto\\" independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. Barcelona formed the nucleus of the emergent Principality of Catalonia. In 1164, the count of Barcelona, Alfons I, inherited the Kingdom of Aragon (as Alfonso II). Thenceforward, the history of the county of Barcelona is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it. - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Occitania (, , , , also sometimes lo País d'Òc, \\"the Oc Country\\") is the historical region in southern Europe where Occitan was historically the main language spoken, and where it is sometimes still used, for the most part as a second language. This cultural area roughly encompasses the southern half of France, as well as Monaco and smaller parts of Italy (Occitan Valleys, Guardia Piemontese) and Spain (Aran Valley). Occitania has been recognized as a linguistic and cultural concept since the Middle Ages, but has never been a legal nor a political entity under this name, although the territory was united in Roman times as the \\"Seven Provinces\\" and in the early Middle Ages (\\"Aquitanica\\" or the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse) before the French conquest started in the early 13th century. Currently about 200,000800,000 people out of 16 million living in the area are either native or proficient speakers of Occitan, although the languages more usually spoken in the area are French, Italian, Catalan and Spanish. Since 2006, the Occitan language has been an official language of Catalonia, which includes the Aran Valley where Occitan gained official status in 1990. - A prince is a male ruler, monarch, or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. \\"Prince\\" is also a hereditary title in the nobility of some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word \\"prince\\", from the Latin noun \\"princeps\\", from \\"primus\\" (first) + \\"capio\\" (to seize), meaning \\"the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince\\". - The House of Trastámara was a dynasty of kings in Spain , which first governed in Castile beginning in 1369 before expanding its rule into Aragón, Navarre and Naples. They were an illegitimate cadet line of the House of Ivrea. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Catalan counties were the administrative divisions of the eastern Carolingian \\"Marca Hispanica\\" and southernmost part of the March of Gothia created after its Frankish conquest. The various counties roughly defined what came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia. - The Bellonids, sometimes called the Bellonid Dynasty, were the counts descendant of the Goth Belló who ruled in Carcassonne, Urgell, Cerdanya, County of Conflent, Barcelona, and numerous other Catalan and Septimanian counties and marches in the 9th and 10th centuries. His most famous grandson was Wilfred the Hairy, who founded the House of Barcelona, rulers of the County of Barcelona from 878, and since 1164 the Crown of Aragon, until the end of the reign of Martin the Humane in 1410. - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast. - A chronicle (from Greek , from , \\"chronos\\", \\"time\\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important. - The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name \\"Carolingian\\" (Medieval Latin \\"karolingi\\", an altered form of an unattested Old High German word *\\"karling, kerling\\", meaning \\"descendant of Charles\\", cf. MHG \\"kerlinc\\") derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: \\"Carolus\\". The dynasty consolidated its power in the mid 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and \\"dux et princeps Francorum\\" hereditary, and becoming the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne. In 751 the Merovingian dynasty, which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian Pepin the Short was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in over three centuries. His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. - The Crown of Aragon was a composite monarchy, also nowadays referred to as a confederation of individual polities or kingdoms ruled by one king, with a personal and dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \\"empire\\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.

Run a fan in the direction of the object and rotate the object to catch all the areas of the object. Justification: Running a fan in the direction of the object will help in quick evaporation of the solvents in the paint, thereby drying the paint faster. Rotating the object will ensure that all areas of the object are exposed to the air, which will help in uniform drying.

His father, Norton Cuban, was an automobile upholsterer, while Cuban has described his mother, Shirley, as someone with \\"a different job or different career goal every other week.\\" He grew up in the suburb of Mount Lebanon, in a Jewish working-class family. His paternal grandfather changed the family name from \\"Chabenisky\\" to \\"Cuban\\" after his family emigrated from Russia through Ellis Island. On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA's Dallas Mavericks for 285 million from H. Ross Perot, Jr. In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team, the Mavericks won only 40% of their games, and a playoff record of 21-32. In the 10 years following, the team won 69 percent of their regular season games and reached the playoffs in each of those seasons except for one. The Mavericks' playoff record with Cuban is 49 wins and 57 losses, including their first trip to the NBA Finals in 2006, where they lost to the Miami Heat. On June 12, 2011, the Mavericks defeated the Heat to win the NBA Finals. Historically, NBA team owners publicly play more passive roles and watch basketball games from skyboxes; Cuban sits alongside fans while donning team jerseys. Cuban travels in his private airplane--a Gulfstream V--to attend road games. In May 2010, H. Ross Perot, Jr., who retained 5% ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some 100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal.

The text provided states: \\"Buildings were ascribed to specific architects – Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio – and the cult of the individual had begun.\\" This sentence focuses on the idea that, during the Renaissance, individual architects started receiving credit for their work, highlighting the concept of individualism. The question asks: \\"What did Renaissance Humanism emphasize?\\" Renaissance Humanism was a cultural movement that emphasized the individual's potential for creativity, reason, and achievement.

It was created by Jennifer Pertsch and Tom McGillis, and revolves around the adventures of Ethan Morgan, played by Matthew Knight, his best friend Benny, and their vampire babysitter, Sarah, portrayed by Vanessa Morgan. The show was initially a television movie that later evolved into a series, airing for two seasons on Teletoon in Canada and on Disney Channel in the United States. Atticus Mitchell's portrayal of Benny Weir in My Babysitter's a Vampire was memorable and garnered him a fan following. Benny is an eccentric and geeky teenager with a penchant for comic books, video games, and science fiction.

Benny's humor, resourcefulness, and strong camaraderie with Ethan add depth to the character and form the core storylines of the show.

This approach offers several benefits for users, including: 1. Enhanced User Experience: Pinch and pull gestures mimic the way humans naturally interact with objects in their environment, making them less reliant on learning new techniques or remembering various button placements. 2. Faster Navigation: With pinch and pull gestures, users can quickly and effortlessly zoom in or out of a screen by simply moving their fingers. This is a more efficient and fluid approach than having to tap specific buttons multiple times. 3. Precise Control: By using pinch and pull gestures, users can enjoy a smoother and more precise control over their experience, as they can easily adjust zoom levels or other settings at a granular level based on their preference. 4. Fewer Errors: Since pinch and pull gestures are less dependent on the accuracy of finger placement compared to tapping buttons, users are less likely to make errors when attempting to navigate through zoom levels or other settings. 5. Greater Accessibility: For users with limited dexterity or agility, pinch and pull gestures are often easier to perform than tapping small plus and minus signs.

The subject matter had previously been generally religious and/or monarchical, featuring essays, poetry, and painting. By roughly 1725, however, this subject matter had radically expanded and diversified, including \\"royal propaganda, philosophical battles, and critical ruminations on the social and political institutions of the Old Regime.\\" Topics of public controversy were also discussed such as the theories of Newton and Descartes, the slave trade, women's education, and justice in France.

The original characters acted exactly as they should, and the new characters were awesome too without taking away from the older ones. Thrawn was cool, and so was Pallaeon, but the coolest new character of all was Mara Jade, who is officially my new favorite character. The best part of the whole book is the whole sequence when she and Luke are stuck in the forest and they have to depend on each other to survive. One thing that bothered me though, is that I simply can't picture kind, caring, sensitive Luke simply walking out on Leia like that, though I do simpathize with his feelings of self doubt.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"The two questions share a similar meaning in that they both inquire about prevalent superstitions in Indian culture. They differ slightly in their emphasis. The first question asks for \\"common\\" superstitions, indicating those widely held beliefs, while the second question seeks \\"popular\\" superstitions, which implies those that have gained prominence or notoriety. Despite their subtle differences, both questions inquire about widely followed Indian superstitions, so the resulting answers will likely overlap considerably. Here is a list of some of the most common and popular superstitions in Indian culture: 1. The Evil Eye (Buri Nazar): Belief in the evil eye is one of the most overarching superstitions in India. People believe that the evil eye can bring bad luck, misfortune, or harm when someone casts a malevolent gaze upon them, their family members, or their possessions. Many people wear black dots, called \\"nazar battu,\\" or use lemon and green chili charms called \\"nimbu-mirchi\\" to protect against the evil eye. 2. Breaking a Mirror: Breaking a mirror is considered to bring seven years of bad luck in Indian culture, much like in Western superstitions. To avoid harm, people sometimes perform rituals or offer prayers to counteract the negative effects of the broken mirror. 3. Sweeping at Night: It is believed that sweeping one's house after sunset can drive away wealth and prosperity. This superstition is based on the idea that the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, may be inadvertently swept out of the house during nighttime cleaning. 4. Menstruation Taboos: Many superstitions surround menstruation in India. Women on their periods are often considered impure and are barred from entering temples, participating in religious ceremonies, and even cooking or touching certain food items. 5. Toenails and Hair: Cutting nails or hair on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Saturdays is considered unlucky, as is cutting them after sunset. Some believe that discarded nail clippings and hair strands can be used for black magic, so they dispose of them carefully and discreetly. 6. No. 13 and Black Cats: Just like in Western superstitions, the number 13 is considered inauspicious in India. Additionally, black cats crossing one's path are also taken as a bad omen, signifying that something unpleasant or unfortunate will occur. 7. Owls: In Indian culture, owls are considered harbingers of bad news or ill fortune. Many people believe that seeing, hearing, or dreaming about an owl is a sign of impending doom or misfortune. 8. Lunar Eclipses: During a lunar eclipse, pregnant women are advised to stay indoors to avoid ill effects caused by the celestial event. Pregnant women are also cautioned against using sharp objects, as it is believed this could cause harm to their unborn child. 9. Shoes and Slippers: Upside-down shoes or slippers are considered inauspicious in Indian culture. People immediately correct a flipped shoe or slipper, as it is believed to bring bad luck or discord within the household. 10. Vastu Shastra: Akin to the Chinese concept of feng shui, Vastu Shastra guides architectural and interior design based on principles of energy flow, balance, and harmony. Many people in India still consult Vastu experts before building or renovating houses, believing that it can bring prosperity, happiness, and good health. These are just a few of the many superstitions prevalent in Indian culture. It is essential to note that these beliefs will vary depending on geographical regions, communities, and religious affiliations. Furthermore, not all individuals in India follow or adhere to these superstitions; education and urbanization have led to a decline in the prevalence of these beliefs among younger generations."},{"question":"Given the question: I read this background article the other day: An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen . Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. I am facing a new situation today: Ben studied allergies ever since he experienced an allergic reaction to pollen. His brother Frank had no interest in the subject whatsoever, he was more interested in engineering. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person studied less about inhaling ragweed pollen? The answer is:","response":"Frank studied less about inhaling ragweed pollen. The background information provided mentions that Ben experienced an allergic reaction to pollen and as a result, he began studying allergies. There's no indication that his brother Frank, whose interests lies more in engineering, has done any similar research or study on this topic.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work. The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase.

Released on October 10, 1966, the single was an immediate critical and commercial hit, topping record charts in several countries including the US and UK. Characterized by its complex soundscapes, episodic structure, and subversions of pop music formula, it was the costliest single ever recorded at the time of its release. \\"Good Vibrations\\" later became widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music. \\"Good Vibrations\\" established a new method of operation for Wilson. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \\"modules\\"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. This was the same modular approach used during the sessions for Smile and Smiley Smile. To mask each tape edit, vast reverb decays were added at the mixing and sub-mixing stages. For instrumentation, Wilson employed the services of \\"the Wrecking Crew\\", the nickname for a conglomerate of session musicians active in Los Angeles at that time. Production for \\"Good Vibrations\\" spanned more than a dozen recording sessions at four different Hollywood studios, at a time when most pop singles were typically recorded in a day or two. It was reported to have used over 90 hours of magnetic recording tape, with an eventual budget estimated between 50,000 and 75,000 (equivalent to 380,000 and 570,000 in 2017), at that time the largest sum spent on a single. In comparison, the whole of Pet Sounds had cost 70,000 (530,000), itself an unusually high cost for an album. It is said that Wilson was so puzzled by \\"Good Vibrations\\" that he would often arrive at a session, consider a few possibilities, and then leave without recording anything, which exacerbated costs. In 2018, Wilson disputed the 50,000 figure for \\"Good Vibrations\\", saying that the overall expenses were closer to 25,000 (190,000). When asked in a 2005 interview if it was true that the Electro-Theremin work alone cost 100,000, he responded \\"No. 15,000.\\" Ask a question about this article.","response":"How did Brian Wilson use the modular approach in creating \\"Good Vibrations\\"?"},{"question":"Something is a more general word used to replace arrows which are headed toward a target.is the reasoning for what question and answer pair?","response":"The question and answer pair for the given reasoning could be: Question: What is a term that can describe projectiles that are aimed toward a target?

The correct way to melt chocolate chips in a microwave is by using a plastic microwavable bowl and heating it in 30-45 second increments until all the chips are melted. This is because plastic microwavable bowls are specially designed to be safe for use in the microwave. The other option, using a stainless steel bowl, is wrong because metal should not be used in the microwave. Metal can cause sparks or even a fire when placed in the microwave.

Does the word \\"trace\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? Trace your path. Trace the outline of a figure in the sand. Options: -different meanings; -the same meaning;","response":"The word \\"trace\\" in the two sentences has the same fundamental meaning, but with slightly different connotations and applications. Let's analyze both usages to provide an in-depth understanding of the similarities and differences. 1. Trace your path. In this context, \\"trace\\" means to follow or determine the course or position of something, particularly by touching or looking at various points along the way. When you trace your path, you might walk along a specific route, draw a line on a map to represent where you've been, or recall the steps you took in the past. In this case, \\"trace\\" implies a sense of retracing or re-experiencing a journey. 2. Trace the outline of a figure in the sand. In this sentence, \\"trace\\" refers to copying a pattern, design, or outline by drawing it on a surface such as sand. When you trace the outline of a figure in the sand, you might physically move your finger on the surface, replicating the edges of the figure, or use an object like a stick to draw the figure. Here, \\"trace\\" emphasizes the act of drawing the outline of an object by following its contours. In both sentences, the underlying meaning of \\"trace\\" involves following and reproducing a particular path, course, or outline. The difference lies in the context and the purpose of the action. The first sentence focuses on following and recording a journey, while the second emphasizes copying and drawing the shape of an object. So, in conclusion, the word \\"trace\\" does have the same fundamental meaning in both sentences, with slight differences in connotation and application."},{"question":"Attributes: name = Strada, eatType = restaurant, food = Fast food, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = 5 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes, near = Rainbow Vegetarian Café.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who helps Ned Thacker? Movie plot title: A Modern Musketeer Movie plot: Although the last half of this film was previously considered lost, it has been found and will be available on DVD and TCM in 2008. The film starts with a tongue-in-cheek flashback with Fairbanks as D'Artagnan (with broad winks at the audience), fighting and defeating a tavern-full of swordsmen just to return a mysterious lady's handkerchief. Through a lap-dissolve, d'Artagnan becomes the modern Kansan Ned Thacker, who was born during a tornado and whose mother read him swashbuckling novels while in the womb. After several episodes where Ned gets into trouble trying to defend women (and a cute cameo by Zasu Pitts), we meet Marjorie Daw, whose mother wants her to marry the rich sleazeball Forrest Vandeteer. They run into trouble on a cross-country automobile trip, and are rescued by Fairbanks when he converts his Ford into a railcar to cross a desert washout. At the El Tovar hotel, we meet the villainous Navajo Chin-de-dah, who lives in a secret cliff-house deep in the Grand Canyon, who leads Forrest and Marjorie to his lair with \\"forced marriage\\" on his mind. With the assistance of one of Chin-de-dah's henchmen, Ned Thacker descends the cliffs on a rope and effects a rescue. While the villain is a very unfortunate Indian stereotype, the footage of the Grand Canyon and Canyon de Chelly is spectacular, and taken in the spirit it was intended, this is a fun, somewhat carelessly constructed romp, and a good example of why Douglas Fairbanks was so popular. In the surviving material shown at the Buster Keaton Festival, some confusion is caused when Forrest Vandeteer's name changes to Forrest Barris part way through, probably because of a difference in the source material. Answer:","response":"One of Chin-de-dah's henchmen helps Ned Thacker."},{"question":"In Dickens’ Great Expectations by what composer’s name does his friend, Herbert Pocket, call Pip?","response":"In Charles Dickens' novel \\"Great Expectations\\", Herbert Pocket, who becomes Pip's close friend, dubs Pip with a nickname; he starts calling him \\"Handel.\\" The nickname comes from the famous German-British Baroque composer George Frideric Handel. Herbert chooses this moniker for Pip because he connects a piece of Handel's music to Pip's good fortune and future expectations. The particular musical piece that Herbert associates with Pip is titled \\"The Harmonious Blacksmith,\\" which is part of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E Major for harpsichord, HWV 430. Herbert playfully believes that the piece reflects Pip's humble blacksmith origins (due to his upbringing with Joe, who is a blacksmith) and the harmony of his character and potential for success in his future life.

Is the following statement correct based on the text can you use sterling in the isle of man","response":"Yes, the statement \\"you can use sterling in the Isle of Man\\" is correct based on the given text. The Isle of Man is in a one-sided de facto currency union with the United Kingdom, which essentially means that the Isle of Man has decided to recognize and accept the currency of the United Kingdom, known as sterling or Pound sterling, as legal tender on the island. Legal tender simply means any officially recognized medium of exchange for goods and services, debts, taxes, etc. When a particular currency is named as legal tender, it means that the law requires people to accept it as a form of payment. So in the case of the Isle of Man, any party to a transaction can offer payment in UK sterling and it must be accepted. Additionally, the Isle of Man backs up its own notes and coins with Bank of England notes. This means that for every unit of currency issued by the Isle of Man, there is an equivalent value in Bank of England notes held as reserves. This helps to ensure that the Manx currency (the currency of the Isle of Man) holds its value and isn't at risk of becoming worthless. The Isle of Man's decision to link its currency to the sterling is advantageous as it provides economic stability and transactional convenience. The island’s close geographical proximity and strong economic ties with the UK makes the use of sterling on the island practical, easy and highly beneficial. In conclusion, while the Isle of Man does have its own domestic currency (the Manx pound), it also fully recognizes and accepts the UK sterling as a legitimate form of payment, and backs its own currency with Bank of England notes. Therefore, if you were to travel to the Isle of Man, you could certainly use UK sterling there."},{"question":"How is \\"Recent developments - in particular before and during the election campaign - demonstrate the need for further steps in this area so that the Armed Forces cannot exercise political influence.\\" said in Finnish?","response":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I possess an advanced language model that allows me to translate English text into various languages, including Finnish.

How many passengers fit in 5 buses?","response":"To find how many passengers fit into 5 buses, we need to first find out how many passengers on average fit into 1 bus and then multiply that value by 5. Step 1: Find the average number of passengers per bus. Total number of passengers = 198 Total number of buses = 9 Average passengers per bus = (Total number of passengers) / (Total number of buses) So, the average number of passengers per bus = 198 / 9 = 22 passengers Step 2: Calculate the total number of passengers that fit into 5 buses. Average passengers per bus = 22 Number of buses we're interested in = 5 Total passengers in 5 buses = (Average passengers per bus) × (Number of buses) Total passengers in 5 buses = 22 passengers/bus × 5 buses = 110 passengers The final answer is that 110 passengers fit into 5 buses."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Manny and Annie were two foodie friends. Manny was a health conscious person, he ate organic foods and drank organic milk only. Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not. Which friend ate more foods free of contaminations? Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. A:","response":"Manny ate more foods free of contaminations. As a health-conscious person, Manny consumed organic foods and organic milk, which are intended to be healthier, free of contaminations, and have fewer chemical residues, compared to conventionally produced foods. Organic food production practices follow strict guidelines and aim to reduce the use of antibiotics, pesticides, and other potentially harmful agents.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Music Man Context: The movie opens with a number of traveling salesmen in a railroad car in 1912, lamenting the things that are making their livelihood difficult--changes in society and the economy, and dishonest salesmen who give them a bad name. They are particularly scornful of a certain \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears. Someone mentions that \\"He don't know one note from another!\\". (This opening song has interesting musical accompaniment: the sound of the train's steam locomotive.) At the end of the song, just when the train is about to start up from a station stop in River City, Iowa, one of the people reveals that he is Harold Hill, and quickly escapes from the train before the others can catch him.Hill finds himself in a small turn-of-the-century Iowa town, full of taciturn people with small-town values. They sing him a song of welcome, explaining that Iowans are stubborn but good natured and generous. He is delighted to find an old friend and colleague from his earlier days as a crooked salesman, Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett). Marcellus says that he is now making an honest living, has settled in River City, and that he likes the town and the people. The two friends reminisce about their shady dealings in the past, and that \\"Professor Hill\\"'s current racket is boys' bands. Marcellus says that it will be difficult to make headway on that front, because the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), is quite smart and will expose him instantly. Harold takes that as a challenge, both professionally and romantically. Harold also mentions that he'll be in town longer than his usual stretch, a week, because not only will he con the town into buying the instruments, but also uniforms, which will take several weeks to arrive.

Almost two weeks after they were driven away from their boarding school in the town in the middle of the night, parents are desperate for news of their daughters. A resident of the small town of Gwoza in the remote north-east said on 25 April she saw a convoy of 11 vehicles painted in military colours carrying many girls. 'My family is crying and grieving' This will be of little comfort to the parents as it suggests at least some are now even further from home, close to the Cameroonian border. The fact that Islamist fighters from the Boko Haram group are still able to move across parts of Borno state in convoys points to the severe limitations of the current military strategy. With thousands of extra troops deployed in the main cities of the north and with the emergence of civilian defence forces or vigilante groups especially in Maiduguri, Boko Haram was under pressure and was forced to change tactics. But this has instead brought the deadliest phase of the conflict with incessant attacks on poorly defended rural villages and smaller towns. About 1,500 people were killed in the first three months of 2014, according to Amnesty International. And the Maiduguri barracks attack last month, as well as the Abuja bomb blast on the same day the girls were abducted, show that the insurgents are not entirely confined to rural areas. Even for those girls who managed to escape during the first few hours of the abduction there is no peace of mind. From preachers to slave raiders What is Nigeria's Boko Haram? \\"I'm so sad now because when I'm at home I think about all my school friends who are there in the bush,\\" one 18-year-old told me from her home in Chibok town, where the abductions took place. \\"I hope they are set free. We are all praying for God to release them so they come back home.\\" The attack is an eerie echo of a mass abduction in northern Uganda back in 1996. A total of 139 girls aged between 11 and 16 were seized from dormitories at St Mary's School in Aboke. They were tied together with rope and were taken away by the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), which says it is fighting for a state based on the Biblical 10 Commandments. So, same terror tactics, different religion. In an extraordinary act of bravery the headmistress, Sister Rachele Fassera, followed them into the bush and managed to rescue 109 of them. The rest were forced to become so-called wives of the rebel commanders. Most of the \\"Aboke Girls\\" escaped and returned years later as young mothers. But at least four of them never came home. In Nigeria there was such utter confusion and terror after the attack on Chibok School that several days later it was still not clear how many girls were missing. There cannot be many countries where the political leaders stay as silent following such a tragedy. So far, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has said more about the Chibok attack than Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan. On Friday, a presidential advisor told the BBC the incident was \\"unfortunate, embarrassing and evil\\". \\"The fact that some of them have been rescued raises our hope that with more effort, the objective of bringing them to safety and to their parents will be achieved,\\" said Reuben Abati. But they were not rescued by the military. They escaped. Mr Abati said the security forces \\"deserve continuous motivation for them to do even more\\". Few would disagree with that thought but there are doubts over whether the soldiers tasked with fighting Boko Haram are getting the support they need from their own bosses. \\"We are in a difficult situation. We are underequipped we do not have the required weapons,\\" a soldier deployed to Borno State told the BBC last month. \\"This problem is not from us at the front line but from our superiors. We, the soldiers, have the courage to confront Boko Haram but we do not have sufficient weapons.\\" \\"You cannot confront someone with more sophisticated weapons than you. It is not our superiors doing the fighting - we are the ones at the front line,\\" he said. \\"So we have to consider our families our parents and when we go there and get killed, what becomes of our families?\\" As has been the case with the long war against the LRA in Uganda, some analysts in Nigeria question whether the possibility of making vast amounts of money from the opaque security funds is a hindrance to ending the bloodshed. Nigeria's budget for security this year is more than 6bn (£3.5bn) - double the allocation for education. \\"The budget for defence is increasing but we don't see that translating into better kit and security personnel…. so in a lot of ways the question is asked whether the resources that are budgeted for security are actually going into equipping the military to be prepared for this,\\" said Clement Nwankwo, a policy analyst. The police are also supposed to play a key role in protecting civilians. If they were well resourced, the streets might not be plagued at night by policemen waving torches and begging for handouts from motorists. Nigeria's Premium Times newspaper has just done an expose on how poorly looked after the police are. \\"Only through black magic could anybody feed his wife and four children for 30 days with the kind of salary the Nigeria Police pays me,\\" the online publication quoted a policeman as saying. The same article says the Police Training School in the north-eastern state of Bauchi quotes officers saying they no longer get issued with a uniform but have to buy them from the local market. The violence in the north-east has been relentless this year but the kidnapping of the girls from Chibok and the focus on their plight has definitely caused more Nigerians, wherever they live, to question their own safety. \\"If they can't protect them up there in the north-east, why would they be able to protect us here,\\" is how one Lagos resident put it. This is a religious country but for some the insecurity is now beyond prayers. \\"Nigerian citizens have been waiting in vain for an effective decisive action from the presidency beside the usual: 'We condemn this act…' But the president is waxing strong in his Pentecostal polemics and total reliance on prayers to solve the country's security failings,\\" says Nigerian writer Victor Ehikhamenor. \\"Nigeria is a highly spiritual country and its past and present leaders know this and have manipulated it to their benefit,\\" he says. \\"However, the current administration has taken it to a new height where God is expected to actually physically solve all the country's debilitating problems from terrorism to corruption to fixing dilapidated infrastructures.\\" Many of the politicians are more focused on the blame game than coming up with solutions and with elections due early next year, the violence could have political consequences. The north-east is an opposition stronghold - the states of Yobe, Borno and Adamawa, where an emergency has been declared, are all under the control of the All Progressive Congress. \\"Not holding polls in the north-east, or reducing their scope, could create political chaos, with the opposition rejecting a close unfavourable national tally. It is also feared that Boko Haram could escalate attacks to undermine the elections,\\" says the International Crisis Group (ICG) in its latest report on the insecurity plaguing Nigeria. \\"It overstretches federal security services, with no end in sight, spills over to other parts of the north and risks reaching Niger and Cameroon, weak countries poorly equipped to combat a radical Islamist armed group tapping into real governance, corruption, impunity and underdevelopment grievances shared by most people in the region,\\" says the ICG. People are trying to ensure that the tragedy of the abducted school girls is not yet another attack that is swiftly forgotten hence the trending of #BringBackOurGirls and #WhereAreOurGirls on Twitter. But given the current insecurity in the north-east it is not a question of \\"if\\" but \\"when\\" and \\"where\\" the insurgents will strike next.

Choices: - microbes - parasites - radiation - mutations A:","response":"The correct option based on the provided paragraph is: mutations. Evolution is the process through which species change over time. The main driving force behind evolution is genetic variation, which arises through mutations. Mutations are random changes in an organism's genetic material, such as DNA, and are responsible for introducing new traits into a population. In the paragraph provided, it is stated that mutations are the key to species evolving. The example given references an organism mutating due to a new allele for a gene that determines coat color. This kind of genetic alteration can potentially result in a change in coat color for the offspring of that organism. Over time, if this new trait proves beneficial for the organisms possessing it, they may have a competitive advantage in terms of survival and reproduction. As a result, the mutation can spread through the population and contribute to the species' evolution. Overall, it is clear that mutations are essential for species evolution as they provide the source of variation necessary for natural selection to take place. Other options, such as microbes, parasites, and radiation, are not the correct answers in this context, as they do not directly relate to the role of mutations in evolution.

A decision was initially slated for Monday, according Leon’s head cheerleading coach, Caylen Berry. Principal Billy Epting, however, said he is “reviewing the various information” and will make a decision in the coming weeks. A girl entering her senior year recently auditioned for a spot on Leon’s award-winning cheerleading team but did not make the cut during an open tryout led by coaches. Since then, one of her parents filed a complaint with the district. Chris Petley, spokesman for Leon County Schools, did not provide details about the nature of the complaint. Berry called out the district for overturning the selection process. She pointed to previous occurrences at other schools, including Lincoln High and Montford Middle. But both principals insisted the decisions regarding cheerleading teams were made at the school level and were not the result of direct district intervention. All complaints that go to the district office must be investigated, explained Ricky Bell, LCS director of Student Activities. LCS will work with school administrators and not blindly overrule decisions, Bell added. “We work to do what’s in the best interest of the student and the school,” he said.

Answer:","response":"Sir Simon Fraser was a prominent Scottish nobleman in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Apart from Neidpath Castle, he had ownership of Oliver Castle, which is the other castle you are asking about. For most of its existence, Oliver Castle has been owned by Fraser family, specifically by Sir Simon Fraser himself. Sir Simon Fraser was born into the Fraser family, which held estates and lands in East Lothian and Tweeddale, including Oliver Castle. The Fraser family held the castle before and during Sir Simon's lifetime, and it formed a key part of their holdings. In summary, Oliver Castle, the other castle that Sir Simon Fraser had for most of its existence, had been owned by the Fraser family, including Sir Simon himself, as a key part of their estate holdings."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who roars with laughter?, using the article: Set in the 1950s, the film begins in medias res near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 on the piano before being shot from behind a portrait painting of a young woman. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a 40-something British professor of French literature. The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \\"Hum's\\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \\"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\\". She has a hysterical outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact., what would be the answer ? A:","response":"A: The first name of the person who roars with laughter is Humbert. This is evident from the passage where it is mentioned, \\"Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte.\\" This indicates that Humbert is the person described as roaring with laughter."},{"question":"Write an email with the following subject: Lunch for UT Summer Analysts and Associates Email:","response":"Subject: Special Lunch Arrangement for UT Summer Analysts and Associates Dear Team, I trust this message finds you in the best of your health and high spirits.

Sarah Burton is a renowned British fashion designer who took over as the creative director of Alexander McQueen in May 2010, following the tragic death of the brand's founder, Lee Alexander McQueen, in February 2010. Burton had been working closely with McQueen since 1996 when she joined the brand as an intern. Over the years, she climbed the ranks within the company and became head of womenswear in 2000. Her talent for design and her collaboration on several standout collections under McQueen's guidance made her the perfect fit for continuing the brand's design legacy. The Duchess of Cambridge's dress, crafted in luxurious satin and lace, was a highly-anticipated component of the royal wedding and garnered significant attention from the international press and public alike. The dress featured an ivory and white bodice with French Chantilly lace and English Cluny lace throughout, along with a delicate floral pattern including roses, thistle, daffodils, and shamrocks, which represented England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The full skirt of the gown cascaded in gazar (a soft, smooth silk fabric), and the back was adorned with 58 gazar-covered buttons and Rouleau loops. The dress also showcased a magnificent train measuring approximately 2.7 meters (9 feet). To complement the gown, the Duchess wore a silk tulle veil embroidered with flowers and held in place by a Cartier-designed tiara, known as the 'Halo' tiara, which was lent to her by Queen Elizabeth II. The dress paid tribute to traditional British craftsmanship, while the bridal gown's modern and elegant silhouette symbolized Sarah Burton's contemporary design approach. The gown's design, inspired by Victorian-era corsetry, featured a narrow waist and a padded hip line, evoking the aesthetics of Alexander McQueen's signature style. Furthermore, the gown incorporated sustainable and organic materials, embodying a balanced fusion of history, artistry, and environmental consciousness. In the months following the royal wedding, the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding gown was exhibited at Buckingham Palace, attracting thousands of visitors. The Sarah Burton-designed dress not only crystallized the reputation of Alexander McQueen as a preeminent British fashion house but also highlighted the beauty and elegance of British design and craftsmanship for a global audience."},{"question":"What does someone do when there are dishes astray in the kitchen? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - gain weight - wait patiently - stand erect - promise to do - washing dishes The answer to this question is:","response":"washing dishes When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, the most suitable option to address the issue is washing the dishes. This involves a series of steps to ensure that the dishes are cleaned properly and safely returned to their designated storage spots. Below is a detailed guide on how to go about washing dishes: 1. Gather all the necessary tools: To wash dishes effectively, you will need the following materials: - Dish soap - Sponge or scrubber - Dishcloth or brush - Dish rack or towel (for drying dishes) - Warm water 2. Scrape off leftovers: Before you start washing the dishes, remove any food particles and leftovers from the dishes using a dish scraper or a paper towel. 3. Fill the sink with warm water: Fill one side of your sink with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap to create a soapy solution. If you don't have a double sink, you can use a large basin or tub as an alternative. 4. Soak the dishes: Place the dishes in the soapy water, ensuring that each item is fully submerged. Allow them to soak for a few minutes to loosen up stuck-on food residue. 5. Begin washing: Start washing the least soiled dishes first, such as glasses and cutlery, followed by plates, bowls, and finally, pots and pans. This method helps to prevent cross-contamination and ensures that the dishwashing water stays clean for as long as possible. 6. Scrub the dishes: Use a sponge or scrubber to clean the surface of each dish. Apply enough pressure to remove stubborn food particles, but be mindful not to damage delicate items like glassware or non-stick surfaces. 7. Rinse the dishes: Once a dish is clean, rinse it under running water to remove soap residue. If you're short on water, you can fill another sink or basin with clean water and use it as a rinse station for multiple dishes. 8. Inspect for cleanliness: After rinsing each dish, take a moment to inspect it and ensure that all food particles and soap residue have been removed. If necessary, rewash any items that aren't completely clean. 9. Dry the dishes: Place the clean dishes on a dish rack or a clean towel to air dry. If you prefer, you can also dry the dishes using a clean, lint-free dishcloth. 10. Put away the dishes: Once the dishes are completely dry, safely return them to their designated storage spots in your kitchen. To maintain a clean and organized kitchen, it's always recommended to wash dishes immediately after use or at the very least, establish a routine to ensure that you never have to deal with an unmanageable pile of dirty dishes again."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, \\"transmit on\\") caused the tape reader to resume.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was the warning signal called that warned the sender that there was impending overflow?\\" Options are: a). yes b). no","response":"Step 1: Understand the user's question The user is asking if the given sentence provides a valid answer to the question about the warning signal that warned the sender of impending overflow.

Title: Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance Movie plot: Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) was a former stunt rider who often teamed up with his father on various stunts. When he discovered that his father's death is impending, he makes a deal with a man named Roarke (Ciarán Hinds) who claims to be the Devil in exchange for his soul and a curse to be set upon him. Johnny now hosts an entity called 'The Rider', a fiery demon who punishes sinners, no matter how petty the crimes are. However, his father dies regardless, and having two minds fighting for control over his new powers, Johnny attempts to stay as far away from mankind as possible, hiding out in Eastern Europe (Romania).In the present, a drunken priest named Moreau (Idris Elba) attempts to warn the order of monks residing in a castle that the Devil has sent out forces to retrieve a certain boy and his mother hiding there, despite the head monk's (Anthony Head) reassurances of their safety.

Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

Article: Spending a lot of time watching TV, playing video games and surfing the Web causes a lot of healthy problems to children such as overweight and smoking, US researchers said yesterday. U.S. experts analyzed 173 studies on how media sources influence the physical health of children and adolescents . The studies, mostly carried out in the prefix = st1 /United States, largely focused on television, but some looked at video games, films, music, computer and Internet use. Three quarters of them found that increased media viewing was connected with poor health. The studies offered strong evidence that children who get more media exposure are more likely to become overweight, start smoking and begin earlier sexual activity than those who spend less time in front of a screen, the researchers said. Studies also showed more media exposure is linked to drug and alcohol use and poorer school performance. \\"We were pretty surprised by the number of studies that showed these negative health results,\\" said one of the researchers in the report. For decades, experts have worried about the effect on young viewers of the violence and sexual content in some TV programs, movies and video games. Another issue is that kids are spending time sitting on a couch watching TV or playing computer games when they could be running around outside. One study found that children who spend more than eight hours watching TV per week at age 3 are more likely to be overweight at 7. And research showed that many USchildren watch far more. Another study showed TV and other media content can have a deep influence on children's attitudes and beliefs, particularly among teens. A US study published in November showed that adolescents who watched more programs with sexual themes had a higher risk of becoming pregnant or causing a pregnancy. Thirteen of 14 studies that evaluated sexual behavior found a connection between media exposure and earlier sexual behavior, the researchers said. Question: How did the experts carry out their research? Answer: Answer:","response":"The experts carried out their research by analyzing 173 studies on how media sources influence the physical health of children and adolescents.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","response":"Based on the question provided, it seems that the main concern is to determine the appropriate duration for wearing a cock ring. While the suggested answer provides valuable information about different ways to wear a cock ring, it doesn't directly address the primary concern of how long it should be worn. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question would be: Cock rings are designed to enhance sexual pleasure and performance by restricting blood flow out of the penis, which results in prolonged erections and increased sensitivity. However, it's crucial to understand that wearing a cock ring for an extended period can cause potential harm. It is generally recommended to wear a cock ring for no more than 20-30 minutes at a time. Prolonged use can lead to penile tissue damage due to restricted blood flow, and in some cases, it may result in priapism (a painful erection that lasts for hours) which can be a medical emergency. Numbness, coldness, and discoloration of the penis are warning signs that the cock ring should be removed immediately. To safely use a cock ring, always ensure that it is the correct size and material for comfort and effectiveness. Silicone, rubber, and neoprene are popular choices due to their flexibility and ease of removal. If you're using a metal or rigid cock ring, make sure it comes with a quick-release mechanism to avoid complications. It is important to listen to your body and keep an eye on any signs of discomfort while wearing a cock ring. As a user, you should never sleep with a cock ring on or wear it for an extended period beyond the recommended 20-30 minutes. If you experience pain, swelling, or any other concerning symptoms, remove the cock ring immediately and consult a healthcare professional if needed. In conclusion, although the suggested answer provides some pertinent information about cock rings, it fails to address the primary concern regarding the appropriate duration for wearing one. Based on safety guidelines and recommendations, a cock ring should be worn for no more than 20-30 minutes at a time to prevent the risk of injury or complications. Always prioritize safety and follow proper usage instructions when using a sex toy like a cock ring."},{"question":"Possible review types: Options: 1). negative. 2). positive..

During Sean Hannity's show on Tuesday, when asked about the matter before the Supreme Court, Carson said, \\"Marriage is between a man and a woman. No group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are. They don't get to change the definition.\\" The comparison of gays to members of the North American Boy/Man Love Association and those who engage in bestiality set off a backlash of criticism in the media, online and on campus. There is now a petition circulating at Johns Hopkins Medical to have Carson removed as commencement speaker in May at the School of Medicine. \\"I think people have completely taken the wrong meaning out of what I was saying,\\" the 61-year-old surgeon said in a telephone interview Friday. \\"First of all, I certainly believe gay people should have all the rights that anybody else has. What I was basically saying is that as far as marriage is concerned that has traditionally been between a man and a woman and nobody should be able to change that.\\" \\"Now perhaps the examples were not the best choice of words, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone,\\" he added. \\"But the point that I was making was that no group of individuals, whoever they are, whatever their belief systems, gets to change traditional definitions. The reason I believe the way I do, I will readily confess, is because I am a Christian who believes in The Bible.\\" The Bible, he explained, \\"...says we have an obligation to love our fellow man as ourselves, and I love everybody the same -- all homosexuals. Everybody who knows me knows I would never say anything to intentionally hurt someone.\\" Given the \\"if I offended anyone\\" tone and language of the apology, it will be interesting to see how it's received. I hope readers will weigh in here. The Sun has also obtained a copy of the petition aimed at getting Carson, who is on the eve of retirement this spring, removed as a speaker at the School of Medicine graduation ceremonies in May. \\"At the time of his nomination, Dr. Carson was known to most of us as a world-class neurosurgeon and passionate advocate for education,\\" the petition says. \\"Many of us had read his books and looked up to him as a role model in our careers. Since then, however, several public events have cast serious doubt on the appropriateness of having Dr. Carson speak at our graduation. If you believe he is an inappropriate choice of speaker at a ceremony intended to celebrate the achievements of our class please complete the petition below.\\" When asked about the petition Friday, Carson told the Sun, \\"I've caught wind of it and I've sent back a message that this is their graduation, their big day, and if they think me being there is going to be a problem, I am happy to withdraw.\\" Speaking of his retirement plans, Carson said he has been speaking with several TV outlets about a career in media. In response to a direct question as to whether he is in discussions with Fox News, where he has been regularly featured since his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, he said, \\"I would simply say that there is more than one station that has asked if I would have any interest, and I am in the process of considering these things.\\" Carson expressed a \\"hope\\" that \\"we can get to a level where we can actually have an intelligent discussion without hysteria\\" on such issues as gay marriage. Good luck with that on highly partisan cable TV channels like Fox News and MSNBC. ||||| Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Ever since I joined the bonfire around Ben Carson's interview on Hannity—the one with the NAMBLA gaffe, you remember it—the occasional critic has told me to look back at the substance of the comment. Carson was making a typical slippery slope argument, asking where people would stop once they started redefining marriage. And, yes, Justice Sotomayor asked a question about this at Tuesday's oral argument. It's probably worth it to excerpt that exchange. David Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one that I'm interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of age to marry, but what's left? MR. OLSON: Well, you've said -- you've said in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy issue, multiple marriages raises questions about exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely different thing. And if you -- if a State prohibits polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct. If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise of a right based upon their status. It's selecting them as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases, you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important and vital in this society, and it has status and stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case. Advertisement Right: The question is whether you accept some social science. One difference between a guy who wants to have six sister wives and a guy who's always been attracted to guys? The available research suggests that the second couple will raise well-adjusted children. The current thinking on pedophilia (to get back to Carson's NAMBLA) rereference is that, like homosexuality, it's innate. But that leads you to the question of child-rearing and other norms, and the homosexuality-pedophilia comparison withers away. Sotomayor and Olson tried to reason this out. Carson just sort of assumes the worst. In his book—which is actually competing with Sotomayor's on the bestseller list—he suggests that the effort to \\"redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures\\" played a part in the \\"dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.\\" That's just ahistorical: gay marriage was a legal deviance in the pagan era, banned by Constantius and Constans more than 100 years before the fall. Look: Being very good, world-historically good, at one thing does not make you a cross-platform expert. Donald Trump is very good at hosting TV shows in which celebrities humiliate themselves, but doesn't seem to know much about public policy. Carson's a brilliant neurosurgeon and a political dilletente. And that's okay! But this fact hurt him after one too many soft-focus Fox News interviews. ||||| Neurosurgeon Ben Carson apologized Friday for comments he made about gay marriage on Sean Hannity’s TV show earlier this week. “I think in terms of what was said on Sean Hannity’s show, that was taken completely out of context and completely misunderstood in terms of what I was trying to say,” Carson told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. “As a Christian, I have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations, and I certainly do, and never had any intention of offending anyone… If anyone was offended, I apologize to you.” Text Size - + reset TOP 5 ways to apologize in politics The John Hopkins doctor came under scrutiny when he appeared to liken homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, sparking the outrage of the LGBT community. “My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn’t matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition,” the doctor, who is the director of pediatric neurosurgery, said on Hannity’s show Tuesday. His comments also led to a petition by students at Johns Hopkins University, who want him to be removed as commencement speaker, as was initially planned. Students, colleagues and the media alike have harshly criticized Carson for his choice of words. (Also on POLITICO: Ben Carson '16? Incredibly slim chance) “They make him look nasty, petty, and ill-informed. It doesn’t tell us anything about his amazing abilities as a surgeon,” Professor Todd Shepard, co-director of the university’s Program for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, said in a statement to Media Matters. “It does remind us, however, that those abilities do not mean we should listen to what he says in any other domain.” Carson said that he would “absolutely” withdraw as commencement speaker if necessary, saying the “last thing” he would want to do is “rain on their parade.” However, the doctor remained firmly rooted in his belief that the term “marriage” should not be extended to same-sex couples, although he said the couples should be treated “kindly” and have whatever legal agreements they desire in order to transfer property and have visitation rights, among other rights. (Also on POLITICO: Conservative pundits split on gay marriage) “Marriage is a very sacred thing and we need to maintain it as a sacred thing. When I say we don’t want to change it or degrade it by calling everything marriage, that’s not aimed at any particular group,” he said. “But the fact of the matter is, the Bible and God have set very specific standards. It’s very clear what’s being said. God doesn’t change, man changes. Our duty is to allow for that change and to still love them and in terms of what happens with them, that’s a decision that’s up to God, that’s not our decision.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Dr. Benjamin Carson, a renowned Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, apologized for his choice of words and examples when discussing gay marriage on Fox News. During the show, Carson made comparisons of homosexuality to NAMBLA and bestiality, which sparked backlash and criticism. A petition circulated at Johns Hopkins Medical to remove Carson as the commencement speaker in May at the School of Medicine. Carson tried to clarify his words and apologized if he offended anyone, reaffirming his belief in traditional marriage while stating that he believes gay people should have equal rights.

Sentence 2: The Gill family sold the mill in 1968 and was closed by the new owners in 1980 . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","response":"Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same information but with slight differences in sentence structure and phrasing. In Sentence 1: \\"The Gill family sold the mill in 1968, and the new owners closed it in 1980.\\" This sentence indicates a sequence of two distinct events. The first part of the sentence informs us that the Gill family sold the mill in 1968. The second part, which is separated by a comma and the coordinating conjunction \\"and,\\" highlights that the new owners closed it in 1980. The use of a comma and \\"and\\" implies that these are two separate clauses that could stand alone as sentences but are connected by the \\"and\\" to paint a cohesive picture of the overall narrative. In Sentence 2: \\"The Gill family sold the mill in 1968 and was closed by the new owners in 1980.\\" This sentence is structured to convey the same events as in sentence 1 but with a slightly different phrasing. The sale of the mill by the Gill family in 1968 is mentioned at the beginning of the sentence just like in sentence 1. However, the second part of the sentence is written in passive voice, \\"was closed by the new owners in 1980,\\" as opposed to the active voice used in sentence 1. Furthermore, the sentence omits the comma before \\"and,\\" making it a compound predicate instead of two separate clauses. Although the phrasing and sentence structure differ, both sentences effectively communicate that the Gill family sold the mill in 1968, and the new owners closed it in 1980. While the first sentence distinctly separates the two events with a coordinating conjunction and a comma, the second sentence combines both events into one smooth narrative. In this sense, the information conveyed is the same, but the execution varies slightly in terms of grammar and sentence construction."},{"question":"Translate \\"The hotel is easily accessible from major highways, close to the Maggiore Hospital, 2 kilometres from the city centre, and 3 kilometres from the airport.\\" to Russian?","response":"To translate the given text into Russian, I will follow these steps: 1.

George Pataki has sent word that it's time to go back to the drawing board. It is the right message, sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about the disappointing quality of the work so far. The governor, like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero, and a 24-hour community in Manhattan's downtown. While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. New York cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed. Pataki openly questioned the Port Authority's requirement that any plan for the site replace all the office, hotel and retail square footage lost in the attack on Sept. 11. More than anything else, that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished options presented two weeks ago. Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately. Opening the process to other designers, both here and internationally, will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary. The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with the transportation network. At this point, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and subway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown. Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region. Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals. But it would be expensive, and the governor, the mayor and their friends in Washington will have to look at long-range ways to pay the bill. Pataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy. Now he needs to follow through with action, to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan, not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this fall's election.

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

Which continent used fewer bromine gasses? Big continent used more air polluting substances, while Small continent was very protective towards the environment. Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Small continent used fewer bromine gases. The paragraph explains that Big continent used more air polluting substances and, as a result, got a hole in its ozone layer. Small continent, on the other hand, was very protective towards the environment, which indicates that they were more conscious of their actions and likely to have used fewer harmful substances, including bromine gases. Chlorine and bromine gases are identified as the chief culprits in destroying the ozone layer. These gases are found in aerosol sprays, coolants, and various other products that contribute to air pollution. Ozone depletion leads to a rise in UV radiation reaching Earth, and this has dire consequences on humans, such as increased skin cancers and eye cataracts, as well as disturbing the nitrogen cycle, killing plankton, and disrupting ocean food webs. These harmful effects emphasize the significance of protecting the ozone layer. The rate of loss of the ozone layer has slowed down due to restrictions placed on pollutants. However, it is still at risk, as indicated in the paragraph. Therefore, it can be inferred that Small continent, with its protective approach towards the environment, used fewer bromine gases compared to Big continent, which employed more air polluting substances and faced the consequences of ozone layer damage."},{"question":"Q:I have a new situation: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. But I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). What is an answer for this question: Which brand of milk has lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland? A:","response":"Based on the provided background information, it can be inferred that the brand of milk with a lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland would be the organic milk, in this case, Luchene. Organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland due to its lower levels of nitrate (NO3−) and phosphate (PO4−) leaching. This is a result of organic farming practices, which involve lower fertilizer application rates. The reduced use of synthetic fertilizers in organic production helps mitigate the negative impacts of nutrient leaching on the environment, specifically aquatic ecosystems, which ultimately reduces eutrophication. It is important to note that each dairy farm's practices will vary, and the degree of eutrophication potential reduction may differ between individual farms. Additionally, animal welfare issues are not necessarily tied to the method of milk production (i.e., organic or conventional). However, based on the available information on Luchene's organic farming process, one can conclude that Luchene's organic milk has a lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland when compared to Jean's non-organic milk."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given context and an answer.

Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), the manager of the Sabena owned HÃ´tel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana (Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda (Kae-Kazim), a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia. As the political situation in the country worsens following the assassination of the president, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed in ethnic violence, initiating the early stages of a genocide. Paul curries favor with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety, and brings them to the hotel. More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened UN refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages. Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength to his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning hotel as the situation becomes more violent. The UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nolte), are unable to take assertive action against the Interahamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul pleads with the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu (Mokoena) for assistance.

Question: What was worshipped in Comte's proposed religion? Context: Eliot and her circle, who included her companion George Henry Lewes (the biographer of Goethe) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau, were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte, whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism. Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to \\"vivre pour altrui\\" (\\"live for others\\", from which comes the word \\"altruism\\"), and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy.

Due to quarterback Brady Quinn's poor performance in the season thus far, head coach Eric Mangini named quarterback Derek Anderson the starter. Cleveland would trail early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. The Browns would continue to struggle in the second quarter as defensive end Robert Geathers returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland would respond with Anderson completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Heiden. The Browns would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Cleveland would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard and a 31-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff. However, Cincinnati answered with Palmer hooking up with Ochocinco again on a 2-yard touchdown run (with a blocked PAT). In overtime, both teams went back and forth with their possessions. In the end, the Bengals emerged victorious with kicker Shayne Graham kicking the game-winning 31-yard field goal. On October 7, the Browns traded WR Braylon Edwards to the New York Jets for WR Chansi Stuckey, LB Jason Trusnik, and third- and fifth- round selections in the 2010 NFL Draft.

He had learned The Yardbirds' \\"Jeff's Boogie\\" and played the song at the audition. Mike Steinbach, the group's drummer, commented: \\"The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on 'Jeff's Boogie,' really fast instrumental guitar, and he played it note for note.\\" Although they played pop rock covers, Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the group's repertoire; he was told that he wouldn't earn a living playing blues music and the band parted ways. Later that year, bassist Tommy Shannon walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar. Fascinated by the skillful playing, which he described as \\"incredible even then\\", Shannon borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few years, they began performing together in a band called Krackerjack. In February 1970, Vaughan joined a band called Liberation, which was a nine-piece group with a horn section. Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan's guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group's original guitarist, modestly became the bassist. In mid-1970, they performed at the Adolphus Hotel in downtown Dallas, where ZZ Top asked them to perform. During Liberation's break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song \\"Thunderbird\\". Phares later described the performance: \\"They tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.\\" Attending Justin F. Kimball High School during the early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class. His musical career pursuit was disapproved by many of the school's administrators, but he was also encouraged by many people to strive for a career in art, including his art teacher. In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but bailed when it conflicted with rehearsal.

On August 11, 1994, the Sting album 'Ten Summoner’s Tales' became the first online purchase for £7.74 and since then, people have taken to online shopping in their millions. Last year, more than £91 billion was spent online and that figure is expected to surpass £100 billion this year. Scroll down for video. More than 25 per cent of British people surveyed in the research conducted by UK retailer Shop Direct said they shopped online while in bed (stock image used) According to new research conducted by UK retailer Shop Direct, one in four British people now shop online at least once a week. The rising number of people using tablets has also played a part, with one in five of the 1,000 surveyed saying they used their device to shop and one in ten using a smartphone. Such is the enthusiasm for digital shopping, more than 25 per cent said they shop online in bed, while one in 20 said part of their morning commute involves some virtual window shopping. On August 11, 1994, the Sting album 'Ten Summoner’s Tales' became the first online purchase for £7.74 and since then, people have taken to online shopping in their millions. Interestingly, the most commonly purchased online item are books, which make up 64 per cent of online buys. This was followed by clothes and accessories with 59.6 per cent, music and entertainment with 55.7 per cent, electronics 54.3 per cent and holiday and travel 50.3 per cent. The rise of online shopping has also been quite rapid, as on average most Brits did not start to use the web for shopping until 2005 and only 12 per cent doing so before the turn of the century. Fiona Ellis Chadwick, senior lecturer in retail management at The Open University Business School, said: 'The early days of online shopping were very basic and the customer experience wasn't fantastic. 'Few Brits had a computer and those that did had very slow internet access, which would take a long time to load an image let alone order a product. 'The customer experience has drastically changed since 1994. British people have increasingly turned away from the high street and bought more items online. This year, online purchases are expected to surpass £100 billion. 'In the early days of online shopping, we would go to the high street and look through various shops and choose from what was on offer.

December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemployment. January 2009: Woolworths shut its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time. February 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger. December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers. October 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - which saw 550 employees losing their jobs. December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers.

That is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received, which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent. The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the \\"Manhattan Project\\" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II. Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built. During the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program. Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere. Today, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds. There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge. The stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford. \\"It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,\\" Peschong said. \\"Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner.\\" The money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time. \\"I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,\\" Gill said. \\"We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get.\\" It is clear by watching Gill's team perform their time-consuming daily tasks that Hanford won't be decontanimated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a \\"glove box,\\" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves, they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure. The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted. The Hanford clean-up \\"has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress,\\" according to the report. Gerry Pollet, who runs a Hanford watchdog organization, says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste. But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed. \\"You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the clean-up and the environment,\\" said Pollet, who heads Heart of America Northwest. \\"They are picking the low-hanging fruit, the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities. But that doesn't cost 2 billion. \\"Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds and you would expect to see real progress for clean-up [to] happen with those dollars.\\" While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used, the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland, Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the clean-up boom. Hanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009, which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn. The Tri-Cities area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington State, and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn, according to the Tri-Cities Industrial Development council. Ken Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was \\"at a standstill\\" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. Brutzman had to hire six temporary workers, two of which he may keep on full time, to deal with the boom in business. \\"We are on track to have best year ever,\\" Brutzman said. His business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable for several more generations since the Hanford clean-up project is expected to take another 40 years. \\"It has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying, 'Wow how does that guy do that?'\\"","response":"The federal government has allocated nearly 2 billion in stimulus funds for the cleanup of the decommissioned Hanford nuclear site in Washington State. This allocation is more than some entire states have received, sparking debate about the proper use of these funds. Hanford was established in the 1940s as part of the Manhattan Project and became the center of US plutonium production during the Cold War. However, decades of improper radioactive waste disposal have resulted in it becoming the most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere. Today, Hanford requires extensive cleanup, including treating millions of gallons of contaminated groundwater, demolishing hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment, and emptying underground tanks filled with radioactive sludge. The stimulus funds are predicted to shorten cleanup times by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford. The cleanup project has created around 1,400 jobs at the site, providing employment opportunities for local residents, like Joe Gill, who was laid off from his previous job when his company closed down. The cleanup work is time-consuming and labor-intensive, involving multiple daily changes of protective gear and the meticulous disassembly of contaminated equipment. Despite these efforts, critics argue that the stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Senators John McCain and Tom Coburn lists Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus funds may have been wasted. The report states that the Hanford cleanup project has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems and has made almost no progress. Hanford watchdog organization, Heart of America Northwest, supports using stimulus money for cleaning up radioactive waste, but questions if it is being appropriately allocated. The group's head, Gerry Pollet, argues that funds have been spent on easy projects that provide good photo opportunities rather than tackling more challenging but necessary tasks. Despite the ongoing debate, the Tri-Cities area surrounding the Hanford site is benefiting from the clean-up boom. The region has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington State, and its housing market has remained relatively stable throughout the recent economic downturn. Local businesses, like furniture store owner Ken Brutzman, have also seen an increase in sales following the influx of stimulus dollars. The Hanford cleanup project is expected to take another 40 years to complete, ensuring continued economic and employment opportunities for local residents and businesses. However, questions remain about whether the 2 billion in stimulus funds is being allocated in the most effective and efficient manner to address the site's significant environmental and safety challenges."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person Commissioner Connor said he wished they'd carried away in a hearse?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Yes, the proposed perturbation of the Earth's core cooling would potentially have a direct and indirect effect on the process of magma rising and forming new crust. Let's break down the implications of a cooling Earth's core on this process. 1. Less heat production: The Earth's core consists of the inner and outer core, and its heat primarily comes from two sources: residual heat from planetary accretion and radioactive decay of isotopes within the mantle and core. If the Earth's core cools down, this would imply less heat being produced and less heat available for the various processes involving the movement of magma. 2. Reduced mantle convection: The heat from the Earth's core drives the movement of mantle materials in a process called mantle convection. If the Earth's core cools, it would lead to a slowdown or cessation of mantle convection. This, in turn, would reduce the movement of magma within the mantle. 3. Less magma movement: As the Earth's core cools and the mantle convection weakens, the movement of magma through cracks in the Earth's crust is likely to decrease. This would directly affect the supply of magma to the surface. 4. Impacts on plate tectonics: Plate tectonics are partially driven by the heat generated from the Earth's core and the movement of the mantle. A cooling core would impact the movement of the tectonic plates, possibly leading to their slowing down or stopping altogether. This can have profound implications for volcanic systems on plate boundaries. 5. Reduced volcanic activity: With less magma movement, pressure, and tectonic activity, we can expect a potential decrease in volcanic eruptions, as magma would be less prone to reaching the surface and causing explosive eruptions. 6. Hindered crust formation: As a result of reduced volcanic activity and less magma reaching the surface, there would be a decline in the amount of lava that cools and solidifies to form new crust material. 7. Impact on volcano formation: Finally, with less magma reaching the surface and fewer volcanic eruptions, the formation of new volcanoes would be significantly affected. Over time, this may lead to fewer new volcanoes being formed and a declined rate of volcanic activity worldwide. In conclusion, the cooling of Earth's core would lead to a series of cascading effects on the movement and convection of magma, which would, in turn, have both direct and indirect impacts on the formation of the new crust and the development of volcanoes."},{"question":"Article: Accused cop-killer Tremaine Wilbourn surrendered to the U.S. Marshals Monday afternoon, ending an intense two-day manhunt by both local and federal authorities.

This has been an around-the-clock investigation,” Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said. “I think he felt the walls closing in and felt it was in his best interests to turn himself in.” Added Mayor AC Wharton: “(Police) worked around the clock to keep the pressure on, to let the suspect know there was no hiding place, that we were not going to relent in any way, making it an imperative that he did what he needed to do.” Wilbourn is accused of shooting Officer Sean Bolton Saturday night in the 4800 block of Summerland Avenue in Parkway Village. Bolton, who would’ve turned 34 this week, pulled in front of a red 2002 Mercedes-Benz that was stopped on the side of the street, police have said. Bolton got out of his squad car and approached that car, police said, but the passenger got out and a struggle ensued. Police say that Wilbourn pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots into Bolton at close range. Police later found drug paraphernalia as well as 1.7 grams of marijuana in the Mercedes. A man who lives in the neighborhood picked up Bolton’s police radio and called dispatchers for help. Bolton was rushed to the Regional Medical Center in critical condition but did not survive. “I think you have an individual who went above and beyond to demonstrate that he’s a violent individual,” Armstrong said. “He committed a bank robbery and I think he’d committed a robbery prior to that. All the signs were there.” Armstrong said he went to homicide to talk to Wilbourn after he was brought in. “I asked him that, ‘Are you okay? Is everything okay?’ And he said yes,” Armstrong said. “He wanted to make it a point to say, ... “I want you to know that I am not a cold-blooded killer and I am not a coward,” Armstrong added. “If you remember, I called him a coward in a press conference and that did not sit too well with him.” A reward of up to 50,000 was raised for Wilbourn’s arrest, but it’s unclear what will become of that now. Wharton said there were legal issues to be sorted out. Wilbourn was on supervised release after a conviction for robbing the Friendship Bank in Covington in 2005. On June 15 of that year, Wilbourn and his uncle, Adam Mackey, then 34, hit the bank and netted 2,000. At the time of the arrest, police said the pair dropped more than 7,500 as they tried to flee the scene. Wilbourn, who was 19 at the time, was sentenced to 10 years and one month in jail. The duo was ordered to repay the 2,000, plus 200 in court fees, which they did in March, according to their plea agreement. Wilbourn was released from prison on July 1, 2014, after serving nine years. He was placed on probation for the robbery for three years. Armstrong said he met with Bolton’s family Sunday, then called them Monday to tell them of the arrest. “As you can imagine, they were relieved,” he said. “Certainly this is part of the healing process. It’s a long process, not only for the Bolton family but for the MPD family as well. This is just ones step in the healing process.” Staff reporter Yolanda Jones contributed to this story. ||||| To help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times. How old was Agassi when he won his first championship?

In order to start training for the rigors of bud/s and the navy you have to know where you're at physically. To do this, you can take a pst.","response":"A Physical Screening Test, or PST, is a crucial tool in measuring your current capabilities and identifying areas that need improvement before attempting the demanding journey to become a Navy SEAL. The PST evaluates your performance in five key exercises: a 500-yard swim, push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, and a 1.5-mile run. To pass the minimum standards, you will need to complete the swim in 12 minutes and 30 seconds or less, perform at least 50 push-ups and 50 sit-ups within 2 minutes, achieve a minimum of 10 pull-ups, and finish the 1.5-mile run in 10 minutes and 30 seconds or less. However, it's essential to note that these are merely the minimum requirements, and excelling in these areas will significantly increase your chances of success. Before beginning any training, it is vital to consult with a healthcare professional or a qualified fitness expert to determine your readiness for such a rigorous program. Once you have been cleared to participate in physical training, focus on creating a comprehensive workout plan that targets all aspects of the PST exercises. This could include endurance events like long-distance running and swimming, as well as strength training, calisthenics, and interval workouts. Stretching and flexibility exercises should also be integrated to prevent injury and maintain overall mobility. As you progress through your fitness journey, re-evaluate your PST scores regularly to track your improvement and adjust your training program accordingly. Be prepared to face setbacks and plateaus, but always maintain a determined and resilient mindset. Don't hesitate to seek advice and guidance from qualified coaches and experienced SEALs who can offer invaluable tips and support throughout your training. In addition to your physical fitness, it's crucial to develop the mental toughness and teamwork skills required to succeed as a Navy SEAL. Engage in activities that challenge your mental fortitude, such as marathon running, mountain climbing, or participation in team sports. Embrace situations that require problem-solving, stress management, and the ability to work well with others. Understanding the importance of leadership and the ability to follow is just as essential as physical strength in becoming a Navy SEAL. Finally, fostering a deep understanding of the Navy SEAL ethos and expectations will significantly contribute to your preparedness for the challenges you will face. Research the history and values of the Navy SEALs, learn about the specific missions they undertake, and immerse yourself in the mentality and discipline required to join their ranks. This comprehensive foundation of physical fitness, mental toughness, teamwork skills, and knowledge will greatly increase your chances of successfully training and ultimately becoming a Navy SEAL."},{"question":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: In the movie what is the name of Viola's goalie, ex boyfriend?

It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population. - Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees, and other woody plants. It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers which are strong in tension embedded in a matrix of lignin which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. - A roof is part of a building envelope. It is the covering on the uppermost part of a building or shelter which provides protection from animals and weather, notably rain or snow, but also heat, wind and sunlight. The word also denotes the framing or structure which supports that covering. - Essex County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts. As of the 2010 census, the population was 743,159, making it the third-most populous county in Massachusetts. It is part of the Greater Boston area (the BostonCambridgeNewton, MANH Metropolitan Statistical Area). The largest city in Essex County is Lynn. - The Capt. Peter Rice House is a historic First Period house at 377 Elm Street in Marlborough , Massachusetts . The oldest portion of this house , a two - room section , dates to 1688 , and was built by Peter Rice around the time of his marriage to Rebecca Howe . It was expanded over the 18th century to its present configuration , a five - bay 2 - 1/2 story saltbox with a large central chimney . The house now serves as the headquarters of the Marlborough Historical Society . The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 . - In colonial American architecture and design, the First Period was the time period of approximately 1626 through 1725. There are more houses constructed by America's earliest settlers in Essex County, Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country. Its successor is the Colonial Georgian Period. - Marlborough (often spelled Marlboro) is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 38,499 at the 2010 census. Marlborough became a prosperous industrial town in the 19th century and made the transition to high technology industry in the late 20th century after the construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - A chimney is a structure that provides ventilation for hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a \\"flue\\". Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, and the term funnel can also be used. - The Massachusetts Turnpike (locally called the Mass Pike or the Pike) is a toll road in Massachusetts, maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning , the highway constitutes the easternmost portion of Interstate 90 (I-90); it begins near Logan International Airport at the eastern border of Boston and becomes part of the New York State Thruway at the Berkshire Connector in Canaan, New York, where I-90 continues towards its western terminus in Seattle, Washington. The turnpike traverses the state, and connects Boston with the major cities of Springfield and Worcester. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A saltbox house is a traditional New England style of house with a long, pitched roof that slopes down to the back, generally a wooden frame house. A saltbox has just one story in the back and two stories in the front. The flat front and central chimney are recognizable features, but the asymmetry of the unequal sides and the long, low rear roof line are the most distinctive features of a saltbox, which takes its name from its resemblance to a wooden lidded box in which salt was once kept.

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Sure, I can assist with that. Let's break the sentence down to make the translation more accurate: - \\"Gegründet wurde es vom Unternehmer Vincenzo Florio\\": This translates to \\"It was founded by the entrepreneur Vincenzo Florio\\". I went with the verb \\"was founded\\" for \\"Gegründet wurde\\" to match the passive voice and past tense of the original sentence. - \\"der auch das Rennen um den Coppa Florio in Norditalien begründete\\": This translates to \\"who also established the race for the Coppa Florio in Northern Italy\\". \\"der auch\\" means \\"who also\\", \\"das Rennen\\" is \\"the race\\", \\"um den\\" is \\"for the\\", \\"Coppa Florio\\" remains the same as it's a proper noun, \\"in\\" is \\"in\\", \\"Norditalien\\" is \\"Northern Italy\\", and \\"begründete\\" translates to \\"established\\" or \\"initiated\\". Here, the context suggests that the founder mentioned in the first part of the sentence is also the one who established the race in the second part of the sentence, therefore I've used the term \\"who also\\" to connect these clauses. So, the full translation is: \\"It was founded by the entrepreneur Vincenzo Florio, who also established the race for the Coppa Florio in Northern Italy.\\""},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Yvonne Pickford, 55, was skiing with her family in Valmorel, France.

I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives. The opening scene particularly annoyed me. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Yelling, \\"Stop dialing\\" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious. As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen. Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have pointed these things out in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why \\"La La land\\" is so named. What is the sentiment of this review?

As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. Answer:","response":"The three people who are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich are Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Flosshilde. These three characters are Rhinemaidens, responsible for guarding the gold in the depths of the Rhine."},{"question":"A no. when divided by the sum of 555 and 445 gives 2times their difference as quotient & 50 as remainder.

See options at the end James knew the food would have got cold before coming back from the store, so he bought the item in a kiosk because the Choose your answer from: a. kiosk is closer.. b. store is closer..","response":"James knew the food would have got cold before coming back from the store, so he bought the item in a kiosk because the kiosk is closer. This decision saved both time and effort, ensuring that his food remained warm and enjoyable when he finally ate it. In daily life, convenience plays a critical role in the choices we make. For James, realizing the potential consequences of a longer trip to the store, such as cold food and a longer waiting time, undoubtedly influenced his decision to opt for the closer kiosk. By choosing the kiosk, he not only managed to keep his food warm, but he also managed to minimize the time spent away from it, making the entire process more efficient and ultimately more enjoyable. Proximity and accessibility can greatly affect the choices we make when it comes to purchasing goods and services. The location of the kiosk in this scenario made it the ideal choice for James in his effort to prioritize time management and satisfy his immediate needs. Even though the kiosk may be smaller in size compared to the store, it provided the necessary items he needed, making it quite useful in this particular situation. Furthermore, the proximity enables the kiosk to serve as a local focal point within the neighborhood. Such establishments cater to the needs of residents who may not be willing or able to travel longer distances to find essential items or services. Often, customers develop relationships with the kiosk's staff and come to rely on its convenience for their daily needs, leading to a symbiotic relationship between the kiosk and the community. Furthermore, small businesses like the kiosk can contribute to the local economy, providing job opportunities and supporting surrounding establishments. On the other hand, larger stores may offer a wider variety of products and services, often at lower prices, due to economies of scale. These advantages can make the store a logical choice for individuals seeking diverse product options or more competitive prices. However, the appeal of a closer, more accessible kiosk may outweigh the potential benefits of visiting a more distant and larger store for many customers, like James in this example. In conclusion, James opted to purchase his item at the kiosk rather than the store due to the undeniable advantage of proximity. The kiosk's location allowed him to spend less time away from his food and ensure that it remained warm and enjoyable. His decision highlights the critical role that convenience plays in our daily lives, shaping the choices we make and the way we interact with local businesses. Although larger stores may offer a more extensive selection and better prices, the accessibility and community ties of smaller establishments like a kiosk can make them ideal for both individuals and the local economy."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

The task provides the inputs i, j, and A, where i and j are non-negative integers less than the length of A, and i is less than j. A is a list containing various elements. Here's how to complete the task step-by-step: 1. Read the inputs i, j, and A. In this case: i = 3 j = 5 A = ['6805', 'x', '9219', 'r', 'Y', '9599', 'I'] 2. Create a new list that contains the elements of A from the ith to the jth position. Remember that list indices start at 0, so you need to subtract 1 from i and j to get the correct indices. newIndexI = i - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 newIndexJ = j - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 3. Slice the list from newIndexI to newIndexJ (inclusive): sublist = A[newIndexI:newIndexJ+1] = A[2:5] = ['9219', 'r', 'Y', '9599'] 4. Reverse the sublist: reversed_sublist = sublist[::-1] = ['9599', 'Y', 'r', '9219'] 5.

This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in United Nations peacekeeping and this looks set to grow in the years ahead, especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict (Goldsmith and Sheptycki, 2007) With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions (Hills, 2009). Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What kind of countries get assistance with policing?","response":"Countries that typically receive assistance with policing are those that can be described as weak, failed or failing, or those that are recovering from conflict or have recently undergone significant political, socio-economic, or environmental changes. These states often face considerable challenges in terms of maintaining public order, ensuring the rule of law, and safeguarding the safety and security of their citizens. In such situations, the international community, through organizations such as the United Nations, regional organizations, or individual donor countries, may step in to provide police development aid and support. Assistance with policing is provided to countries that demonstrate the following characteristics: 1. Weak institutional capacity: These countries often have inadequate or dysfunctional law enforcement and security institutions. The police forces may lack the necessary skills, knowledge, equipment, and resources to effectively carry out their mandate, leading to poor performance and an inability to tackle crime and maintain public order. 2. High levels of crime and insecurity: Countries with high levels of crime, violence, and social unrest often require external support to strengthen their policing systems and build the institutional capacity needed to confront these challenges. Organized crime, terrorism, and other forms of transnational crime may be particularly acute in these states, further exacerbating the security situation. 3. Post-conflict or fragile states: Countries recovering from conflict or civil war typically face numerous challenges related to policing and public security. State institutions, including police forces, may have been severely weakened or even dismantled during the conflict, resulting in a lack of trained personnel and resources to maintain order and protect citizens. These states may also struggle with issues such as disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants and rebuilding trust between the police and the local population. 4. States undergoing political or economic transition: In countries experiencing significant political or economic changes, such as transitioning from autocratic to democratic systems, the existing police and security apparatus may be ill-suited to a new political environment and require substantial reform. Development aid and technical assistance may be useful in helping these countries modernize their policing systems and adapt them to be more efficient, transparent, and accountable. Transnational police development aid aims to address these challenges by enhancing the capacity of recipient countries' law enforcement and security institutions. This can include activities such as training programs, the provision of equipment and infrastructure, and the development of policy and regulatory frameworks. It is essential to recognize that the transfer of policing models and practices between jurisdictions should be done with caution, as the unique socio-political and cultural contexts of each country must be taken into consideration. Donors need to be sensitive to these factors and work collaboratively with recipient countries to ensure that the assistance provided is culturally appropriate, effective, and sustainable in the long term."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

What may be the reason they have hit a wall ? pick from the following. --They did n't stop before they got to the wall .; --None of the above choices .; --They have been eating too much junk food .; --They do n't have enough energy .;","response":"Based on the context provided in the text, it seems that the reason they have hit a wall could be attributed to the fact that they don't have enough energy. The difficulty they are experiencing in completing the last rep on both days 2 and 3 of week 3 suggests that their physical endurance is being challenged. This challenge could stem from not having enough energy to perform at the required level. It is important to consider factors that might be affecting their energy levels, as well as ways to address this issue. Some possible reasons for their lack of energy could be an inadequate diet, insufficient sleep, overtraining, or even potential underlying health issues. To overcome the \\"wall\\" they have encountered, they might need to reevaluate and modify their current lifestyle habits, such as incorporating a well-balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and allowing for adequate recovery between workouts. Additionally, it is crucial for them not to feel discouraged by their current struggle, as recognising their limitations and being willing to adapt their training schedule reflects a healthy approach to their fitness journey. By repeating week 3, they are giving themselves the opportunity to build greater endurance and resilience gradually, rather than expecting immediate results and risking potential injury from overexertion. In conclusion, the reason they have hit a wall appears to be a lack of energy, which could be a consequence of various factors like inadequate diet, sleep, or recovery time. Addressing these issues and remaining flexible in adjusting their training plan will likely help them overcome the current hurdle and progress towards their goal of increasing their physical capacity and endurance."},{"question":"I've been thinking about the mindwipe, now two days away.

Give examples. Consider all the question words. Avoid generalizations. Article:","response":"Title: Effective Tips for Writing Engaging and Informative Articles Writing an article may seem like a challenging endeavor, particularly when you want your audience to engage and take something memorable away from your piece. However, by following a set of guidelines, this can be a rewarding task. This article seeks to provide insight into how to choose a topic, decide on a call to action, answer the question, consider the length, give examples, contemplate all the question words, and avoid generalizations. The first step is selecting a topic you're knowledgeable about. The importance of this step reflects in your ability to convey your thoughts and information with authority and confidence. By choosing a subject you're well-versed in, you can ensure that you communicate your ideas effectively, thus, making your article more engaging and credible. Subsequently, deciding on a call to action is critical. Your call to action is the response you want your readers to have after they've finished reading your piece. This could vary from merely sparking a discussion on the topic to triggering a change in behavior or mindset. Your article should design to motivate your readers to respond to your call to action. After deciding on a call to action, it's crucial to answer the question. Every article should aim to resolve a problem, answer a question, or fill an information gap. By answering the question, your article becomes a valuable resource, providing information that your readers may find useful or enlightening. Next, consider the length of your article. While there may not be a set standard for article length, it’s vital to ensure your piece is long enough to cover the topic in depth but not so extensive that it bores the reader. Be Concise, but make sure to cover all necessary points to give your readers a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Incorporating examples into your article can greatly enhance its clarity and depth. Providing examples to back your points or express your ideas helps the readers visualize and better understand your concept. These real-world illustrations reinforce your arguments and provide tangible evidence to back up your ideas. Additionally, take into account all the interrogative words – who, what, when, where, why, and how, as they can help structure your article and ensure exhaustive coverage. Every question word addresses a unique aspect – perhaps the circumstance (when), or the reasons (why), or the procedures (how). Including these aspects in your article ensures a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Lastly, it’s essential to avoid generalizations. While they might seem like a shortcut to cover more information, generalizations can lead to misinformation or oversimplification of complex topics. Always strive for accuracy and specificity in your writing to provide the most reliable and comprehensive information to your readers. In conclusion, article writing is a multi-faceted task that requires careful thought and planning. By choosing a knowledgeable topic, deciding on a call to action, answering the question, considering the length, providing examples, incorporating all question words, and avoiding generalizations, you can write a more engaging and informative article. Each step in the process serves to enhance the richness, reliability, and relevance of your article, thereby making it a valuable resource for your readers."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Although there have been hundreds of other books declaring to offer a quick look behind the Palace doors, this is the first written by someone who is closely related to the Royal Family and has shared their lives--not only throughout the Queen's reign but also through that of her father, King George VI.

It tells in details the story of Mrs. Rhodes's relationship with the Royal family over eight decades. The book, with delightfully informal and never-before-seen pictures, has been written with the full knowledge of the Queen, who has read and approved parts of it. Born in 1925, the Honorable Margaret Rhodes has led an extraordinary life. She was the childhood playmate of her cousin, the Queen; a wartime M16 spy; and she was a lady-in- waiting to her aunt, the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, from 1991 until the latter's death in 2002. At the Queen's 80thbirthday in April 2006, Margaret gave an interview to the BBC which she proved that, in her own opinion and despite several false reports, the Queen would not abdicate . In this charming autobiography ,she told how she was offered a house to live in the Royal farm in Windsor Great Park unexpectedly. One day when she and the Queen were out riding outside, she suddenly returned and said, \\"Could you bear to live in the suburb?\\" \\"I think it should be OK.\\" Therefore Mrs. Rhodes is now still living there.

Julius Caesar is informed, and laughs. He makes a decision with his council and goes to Armorica, to speak with Vitalstatistix. He gives the Gauls a series of 12 tasks, inspired by Hercules (but new ones, since the 12 Labours are outdated). Vitalstatistix assembles their best warriors, Asterix and Obelix, to do the job. The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1. Run faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games. Asterix, helped by the magic potion, follows Asbestos until he runs so fast he becomes a rocket and exceeds the speed of sound, before hitting an apple tree. His nose swells up like a balloon and Obelix comments on how Gaulish it looks.2. Throw a javelin farther than Verses, the Persian. Verses' javelin hits North America (still only inhabited by Indians, including another Goscinny-Uderzo character, Oumpah-pah), but Obelix's javelin somehow enters a stable orbit and ends up pursuing Verses into the distance. As far as anyone can tell, he's still running from it.3. Beat Cilindric, the German. Cilindric turns out to be an unexpectedly diminutive man wearing a Judo gi but he quickly beats Obelix with a \\"fighting technique he learnt in a distant land\\". Asterix defeats Cilindric by tricking him into giving a lesson and asking for demonstrations that eventually end up with Cilindric's own arms and legs tied in knots.4. Cross a lake.

If she doubles up both sets of bands and places them around her legs and picks up a 10-pound dumbbell, how much weight will she squat?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total resistance provided by the exercise bands and then add that to the weight of the dumbbell. Here's a detailed solution: 1. Lindsey bought 2 exercise bands, and each band adds 5 pounds of resistance. So, 2 bands will add: 2 bands * 5 pounds per band = 10 pounds of resistance. 2. She doubles up both sets of bands, so this doubles the resistance provided by the bands: 10 pounds of resistance (from 2 bands) * 2 (doubling up) = 20 pounds of resistance. 3. Lindsey also picks up a 10-pound dumbbell, so we need to add the dumbbell's weight to the total resistance provided by the exercise bands: 20 pounds of resistance (from doubled bands) + 10 pounds (dumbbell) = 30 pounds total weight. So, when Lindsey squats with the doubled up exercise bands and the 10-pound dumbbell, she will be squatting a total of 30 pounds."},{"question":"Alan Shepard, selectedByNasa, 1959 What is sentence that verbalizes this data?","response":"In 1959, a man named Alan Shepard was chosen by NASA, which is a special group that studies space and sends people to explore it."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? Lawrence made a failed attempt to stab Randy , as","response":"Lawrence made a failed attempt to stab Randy, as his reflexes kicked in, expertly dodging the vicious attack and successfully disarming his assailant in one swift motion. As the tension between the two had been growing for weeks, this was an unfortunate, though not entirely unpredictable, outcome of their heated disagreement. Randy had always been the more level-headed of the two, and his military training had honed his instincts in split-second situations like these. Lawrence, on the other hand, was known for his impulsive behavior, which was fueled by a need to prove himself and a penchant for holding grudges. After Randy successfully parried the attack, their friends, who had been trying to mediate the argument, quickly sprang into action to intervene and prevent the situation from escalating further. They pinned Lawrence to the ground to stop him from making another attempt on Randy's life, while they shouted at Randy to keep his distance and not engage in any further violence. As Lawrence lay there on the floor, panting and flushed with adrenaline, he looked up at Randy with a mix of shock and embarrassment. He knew deep down that his actions had likely destroyed any chance of salvaging their friendship - and that his pride and temper had created a rift that was unlikely to heal. Randy, however, stared back at him with a mix of sadness and disappointment, as he tried to comprehend how their once-close relationship had deteriorated to a point where one friend was now trying to kill the other. He realized that they had reached a point of no return, and that their friendship had been irreversibly damaged by a series of misunderstandings and miscommunications. Just as Lawrence was being restrained by their friends and led away to cool off, the police arrived on the scene. They quickly assessed the situation and determined that the threat had been neutralized. After questioning both parties and the witnesses, they decided to arrest Lawrence for assault with a deadly weapon. As Randy watched the police escort Lawrence out of the building, he couldn't help but feel a profound sense of loss - not just for the friendship he once cherished, but also for the naive belief that they would always be there for each other, no matter what. He knew that moving forward, things would never be quite the same. In the aftermath of the incident, Randy found himself reflecting on their friendship, the memories they had shared, and the choices they had made that led them to this point. He tried to find solace in the fact that he had done his best to avoid the confrontation, and that he had acted in self-defense when it was forced upon him. But despite this rationalization, the guilt and sorrow continued to weigh heavily on him. It was a sobering reminder that relationships can be fragile, and that the bonds of friendship can be torn apart in an instant by the careless, irrational actions of one person. In the end, Lawrence's failed attempt to stab Randy served as a testimony to the fact that when emotions spiral out of control, reason and understanding can easily give way to anger and violence - leaving only regret, heartbreak, and a bitter longing for what once was."},{"question":"Question: he population of a city is 110,000.

Some random reasoning:","response":"To find the population of the city 2 years hence, we will use the formula for compound interest, which calculates the future value of a given amount after a specified number of periods at a given growth rate. Formula: Future Population = Present Population * (1 + Growth Rate)^Number of Years In this case, the present population is 110,000, the growth rate is 6% per annum (or 0.06 as a decimal), and the number of years is 2. Future Population = 110,000 * (1 + 0.06)^2 Now, we will calculate the future population: 1. Add 1 to the growth rate: 1 + 0.06 = 1.06 2. Raise the result to the power of the number of years: 1.06^2 = 1.1236 (rounded to four decimal places) 3.

(CN) - A woman who found a man's face on the floor of a car wash blames a trucking company for it, claiming its driver ran over a man and left him dead on the road, whereupon another driver ran him over again, then washed his face off her car. Kimberly Kriege sued CRST Expedited on Monday in Gallatin County Court. Aside from defendants John Does I-III, they are the only parties to the lawsuit. Kriege, a veterinarian, says she drove her truck to the Super Car Wash in Livingston on Sept. 30, 2013, and found a human face on the floor of the wash bay. She immediately called police, who \\"treated [her] as a criminal suspect,\\" impounded her truck, demanded a blood sample and held her for several hours, she says in the complaint. The face belonged to 81-year old Elgie Bedford, of Alaska, who had been en route from Wasilla to Paris, Texas to visit his children and grandchildren. Bedford, whose car had gone off the road, was walking along Interstate 90 near Big Timber on Sept. 30 when he was struck by a CRST truck driven by David Welk, according to the lawsuit and media reports. \\"Welk turned his semi-truck around and drove to the impact location, where he used a flashlight to observe objects lying on the highway,\\" Kriege says in the complaint. \\"Welk told his co-worker that he saw clothing and a duffle bag when he actually saw Bedford's body.\\" Kriege said Welk was obligated to call law enforcement to report the accident, but just \\"left the body on the highway, knowing that someone could be held responsible for the hit and run death.\\" Investigators believe Bedford's body had been struck by multiple vehicles before Montana Highway Patrol officers discovered it at about 7:30 a.m. One driver who ran over the body was 31-year-old Wryan Young, who drove to the car wash in Livingston, where she cleaned her Ford pickup and \\"left a large portion of Bedford's face on the car wash floor,\\" Kriege says in the complaint. Kriege, says that finding \\"a large recognizable part of a human face\\" traumatized her severely, necessitating \\"intensive psychological counseling.\\" Welk, 45, of Marion, Ind., was arrested in Iowa on Jan. 23, 2014 after his co-driver called to report they had hit something. He was convicted in Sweet Grass County District Court in Big Timber the following October. District Judge Katherine Bidegaray sentenced him on Jan. 6, 2015 to a 6-year deferred sentence for leaving the scene of the accident, giving him credit for the 348 days he spent in jail. Prosecutors unsuccessfully sought a 2-year jail sentence, according to The Associated Press. Young, from Oak Harbor, Wash., was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and tampering with evidence. Her father, Westley Young, 50, who had been traveling with his daughter when she hit Bedford's body, was charged with tampering with evidence. At the time, both faced up to 10 years in prison and a 50,000 fine each. Prosecutors in Sweet Grass and Park counties dismissed the charges against Wryan Young in late 2014, according to the Whidbey News-Times. She testified in Welk's trial in October 2014 and said she believed she had run over a piece of tan cloth, according to the News-Times. Courthouse News was unable to ascertain the outcome of her father's case. Kriege's attorney, Michael Sand in Bozeman, did not return a phone call Wednesday. Kriege seeks medical expenses and damages for lost income, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. ||||| Apple starts a busy week with new iPhone launch Apple starts a busy week with new iPhone launch Apple is kicking off a busy week: Today the giant tech company will host reporters and analysts at its Silicon Valley headquarters for a product launch event.

There was one very well-off bunny in the village who had a large burrow and lots of food saved up. He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been. Question: What is most likely true about Reverend Billy Bunny? Options: - He is scared that the drought won't end - He is hopeful that the drought will be over - not enough information - He is happy that the drought is happening === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"He is hopeful that the drought will be over"},{"question":"Write the last sentence in this story.

Cynthia was interested to hear it.. (b). Megan was interested to hear it.. Complete the following sentence. Cynthia wanted to tell Megan that she was pregnant, and","response":"b. Megan was interested to hear it. Cynthia and Megan have been friends for years, sharing the ups and downs of life together. Their bonds have been strengthened over time, and now that Cynthia is preparing to embark on the incredible journey of motherhood, Megan's interest and excitement are palpable, as she knows how much this moment means for Cynthia. When the day finally came for Cynthia to share the news, she couldn't contain her joy. She nervously stood in front of Megan, clasping her hands together, and finally, with a trembling smile, she uttered the words that would forever change their lives: \\"I'm pregnant!\\" Cynthia's eyes sparkled with happiness and anticipation, and she eagerly awaited Megan's reaction. Megan, unable to hold back her own smile, was genuinely interested and excited to hear the news. She couldn't believe that her best friend was about to become a mother, and she was deeply touched that Cynthia chose to share this incredible moment with her. Overwhelmed with emotion, Megan hugged Cynthia tightly, her eyes glistening with tears of joy. In the weeks and months that followed, Megan's interest in Cynthia's pregnancy continued to grow. She regularly inquired about her friend's well-being, whether by asking about her cravings, offering support during morning sickness, or discussing potential names for the baby. This constant communication and support only served to strengthen their already close relationship. As the day of Cynthia's baby shower approached, Megan, always interested in making her friend's experiences as memorable and enjoyable as possible, took it upon herself to coordinate the festivities, enlisting the help of friends and family members to ensure that everything went smoothly. During the event, Megan couldn't help but notice the radiant glow emanating from Cynthia, as the expectant mother basked in the love and support of her close-knit community. Throughout the entirety of Cynthia's pregnancy, Megan's interest and enthusiasm never waned. Whether it was providing emotional support during a prenatal appointment or planning a nursery together, Megan was an unwavering presence in Cynthia's life. This period of time only served to strengthen the bond these two friends shared, as together they navigated the challenges and joys of pregnancy. Finally, the day arrived when Cynthia went into labor. Grateful to have Megan by her side, the two friends braved the trials of childbirth together. And when the baby was finally placed in Cynthia's arms for the first time, Megan stood to the side, tears streaming down her face, knowing that their lives had changed forever. From that moment on, Megan was not only interested in Cynthia's pregnancy and parenting journey but took an active role in it, loving and nurturing both Cynthia and her newborn baby as if they were her own family. Thus, the answer to the sentence completion is: Cynthia wanted to tell Megan that she was pregnant, and Megan was interested to hear it."},{"question":"Given the question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: where is roger federer from sui?

Who is \\"they\\" in this prior sentence(see options)? Options: (1). The FBI (2). the police","response":"In the given sentence, \\"The FBI usually take over the crime scene from the police since they are more qualified in handling these situations,\\" the pronoun \\"they\\" is referring to 'The FBI' in the context of this sentence. This is the first option that is provided in your list of options. The use of \\"they\\" is set in reference to the subject that is performing the action of taking over the crime scenes - that subject is 'The FBI'. The sentence structure and context implies that after the FBI takes over from the police, they (the FBI) are presented as more qualified to handle these situations. This means the pronoun \\"they\\" is relating back to the FBI rather than the police. However, the pronoun \\"they\\" could potentially refer to the police if the sentence context changes. For example, if the sentence was written as \\"The FBI usually take over the crime scene from the police, but they are more qualified in handling these situations,\\" in this case \\"they\\" would be referring to the police. Pronouns often refer to the closest noun or noun phrase preceding them (this tendency is often known as 'proximity agreement'). However, interpretation can also depend greatly on the context, meaning, or semantics of the sentence. In this case, the context of the sentence makes it clear that \\"they\\" refers to 'The FBI.' Hence, the pronoun \\"they\\" in this sentence refers to option (1) - The FBI."},{"question":"Charlton is related to several professional footballers on his mother's side of the family: his uncles were Jack Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford City), George Milburn (Leeds United and Chesterfield), Jim Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford City) and Stan Milburn (Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), and legendary Newcastle United and England footballer Jackie Milburn, was his mother's cousin. However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie. His elder brother, Jack, initially worked as a miner before applying to the police, only to also become a professional footballer with Leeds United. His other brother, Tommy, plays walking football for the Mature Millers club in Rotherham. He played in qualifiers for the 1962 World Cup in Chile against Luxembourg and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3-1 group win over Argentina was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, and he was still only 24 years old, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by Brazil, who went on to win the tournament. By now, England were coached by Alf Ramsey who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the committee-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection - it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form. Luckily for Charlton, he had all three. A hat-trick in the 8-1 rout of Switzerland in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the record jointly held by Tom Finney and Nat Lofthouse and Charlton's 31st goal against Wales in October the same year gave him the record alone. Charlton's role was developing from traditional inside-forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player, with Ramsey planning to build the team for the 1966 World Cup around him. When England beat the USA 10-0 in a friendly on 27 May 1964, he scored one goal, his 33rd at senior level for England. His goals became a little less frequent, and indeed Jimmy Greaves, playing purely as a striker, would overtake Charlton's England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.

Seeking More Ways to Distribute Aid in Syria UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations is under pressure to ratchet up aid to nongovernmental organizations that can operate in the vast sections of Syria under opposition control, as most of the humanitarian relief sponsored by the organization ends up in the western slice of the country held by President Bashar al-Assad. More than 85 percent of food aid and more than 70 percent of medicines went to government-held areas in the first three months of this year, compared with roughly 50-50 a year ago, because of intensified conflict on the ground, according to the United Nations. That stark inequity, which Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due to reveal publicly next week in his monthly assessment to the Security Council, is likely to inflame the sentiments of Western and Arab donors who are already leaning on United Nations agencies to divert aid from the government to zones under the control of Mr. Assad’s opponents. That, senior United Nations officials say, is easier said than done. Trucking in aid from Turkey without the government’s consent would risk expulsion from the country and in turn losing the ability to deliver relief to more than four million people who live in government-held areas. John Ging, who manages field operations worldwide for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the agencies had been told by the government that they would be kicked out of government-held parts of the country if they crossed borders without the state’s consent. “The calculation of what to do in the face of such threats and obstruction is very complex; history will judge as to whether we got it right or wrong,” Mr. Ging said. “In the meantime, we will never accept being blocked from saving lives and have appealed to the Security Council for help.” Cross-border aid is a tricky matter for the United Nations agencies because of a raging debate inside the world body about whether the law allows them to enter Syrian territory without the state’s permission. But just trucking in aid from the long northern border with Turkey wouldn’t solve the problem. Some two million Syrians are deep inside the country — and getting food and medicines to them means crossing front lines and then checkpoints manned by numerous armed opposition groups. So far, a little more than a half-dozen rebel groups, including the Free Syrian Army, have agreed to let United Nations aid convoys come through their areas, though none of the extremist groups affiliated with Al Qaeda, which now dominate several key areas and roads. “Their reason is it’s not secure. Our response to that is we will take the risks,” Mr. Ging said. “We are making a careful calculation every day on what’s the best thing to do in the face of impossible circumstances.” The debates within the world body come nearly three months after the Security Council passed a legally binding resolution urging the warring parties to allow shipments of food and medicines. Since then, the United Nations humanitarian agencies have chronicled the ways in which the resolution has been repeatedly flouted. Mr. Ging’s boss, Valerie Amos, the emergency relief envoy, has urged the Council to take further steps. The Council has found itself deadlocked. Its original resolution has no enforcement provision, but it threatens to take “further steps” in the event of noncompliance. Now, Australia, Jordan and Luxembourg are drafting a new resolution that would seek to strengthen the original measure, possibly under Chapter VII of the organization’s charter, which authorizes force to back the Council’s demands. Its chances of passage are unknown. Russia has long been loathe to agree to any enforcement language — and is likely to veto a measure with any force. Separately, Britain announced last week that it would dole out a greater share of aid to nongovernmental organizations that can operate in opposition-held areas without consent of the Assad government. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday hinted Washington was considering increasing support to aid groups that can operate in rebel-held territory. United Nations officials said they were vetting smaller aid agencies that can operate in different parts of the country and were seeking to escalate donor funding so they can get relief into hard-to-reach areas. Aid groups are looking to the world body for more help in coordinating their activities, including negotiating safe passage with a variety of armed groups that set up checkpoints along the roads. Mercy Corps, which worked in several parts of Syria, was recently prohibited from operating in Damascus. Five staff members of Médicins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, were released this week after being abducted in northern Syria by an armed group that the aid organization refused to name.

Providing aid from Turkey without government consent could lead to expulsion from the country and the loss of the ability to deliver relief to over four million people living in government-held areas.

The U.N. is exploring other ways to distribute aid within Syria, such as vetting smaller aid agencies that can operate in different parts of the country and seeking to increase donor funding to enable relief in hard-to-reach areas.

One is near Miami, which is in the tropic. The other is near New York, which is in higher latitude. In total, he took four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. From Miami thermocline he took sample A. Then from below Miami thermocline he took sample B. From New York thermocline he took sample C. Finally, from below New York thermocline he took sample D. But I can use this background: If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. What is an answer for this question: Which thermocline would be deeper, sample A or sample C? The answer is:","response":"To answer the question, \\"Which thermocline would be deeper, sample A or sample C?\\", let's examine the given information step-by-step: 1. Sample A is taken from the Miami thermocline, which is in the tropic. 2. Sample C is taken from the New York thermocline, which is in higher latitude. 3. The background information provided states that \\"The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes.\\" From this information, we can use Step 3 to deduce the answer to the question. The answer is: The thermocline for Sample A (Miami) would be deeper than the thermocline for Sample C (New York) because the tropical thermocline (Miami) is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes (New York)."},{"question":"Answer the question...who does rayna end up with in nashville??","response":"In the television show \\"Nashville,\\" Rayna James, portrayed by Connie Britton, has numerous relationships and romantic entanglements throughout the series.

With the aim of raising awareness of mail scams and to provide tips on combating such fraud, this article intends to assist vulnerable individuals by shining light on the issue. Additionally, it serves as a call-to-action for communities and support networks to work together in an effort to combat this problem. Step 1: Elaborate on mail scams and its impact on society Firstly, it's essential to explain the concept of mail scams. Mail scams involve sending fraudulent letters, forms, e-mails, or packages to citizens in order to deceive them into either revealing personal information or transferring money to the scammers. These scams are particularly nefarious, as they often prey on vulnerable individuals, including seniors and people with disabilities – those who may be more susceptible to manipulation. In the context of Derbyshire, these mail scams have resulted in many innocent victims losing their hard-earned money or sharing sensitive information that can lead to identity theft. This has an overwhelming impact on society, leading to emotional and financial distress for the affected individuals and their families. Step 2: Present statistics, news reports, and expert opinions To strengthen the article's credibility, it is important to include recent reports and statistics about mail scams in Derbyshire and provide insight into the volume and sophistication of such crimes. For instance, mention instances like pensioners receiving fake lottery winnings letters or instances of criminals posing as government officials to extract sensitive information from victims. Incorporating quotes from law enforcement agencies or local government officials showcasing their concerns and commitment to tackling the problem would add value to the article. Step 3: Offer practical tips and advice to vulnerable individuals Providing actionable advice on how vulnerable individuals can protect themselves against mail scams is crucial. These tips could include: - Remaining vigilant and treating unsolicited mail and emails with caution - Never providing personal or financial information to unknown senders - Verifying the authenticity of a sender by calling the company or government agency directly - Encouraging the use of shredders to destroy sensitive documents instead of discarding them whole - Reporting suspicious mail to the appropriate authorities, such as Action Fraud or the police Step 4: Emphasize the importance of community support Another vital component of this article is emphasizing the role communities play in addressing this issue. Families, friends, and neighbors should check in on their vulnerable loved ones, ensuring they are educated about the dangers of mail scams and empowered to protect themselves. Furthermore, local organizations, such as senior centres and community groups, can play a role in providing resources and support to those who may be at risk of falling victim to these scams. Conclusion: In conclusion, we must remember that the fight against mail scams targeting the elderly and other vulnerable groups in Derbyshire is a responsibility that falls on all of us. By raising awareness, providing advice, supporting vulnerable individuals within our communities, and reporting suspicious activities, we can work together to combat this growing problem. Through collective efforts, we can help to protect the most susceptible in our society and discourage criminals from profiting at their expense."},{"question":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: This section's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia.

However, let's expound on this topic further for better understanding. The Battery Charging Specification (BCS) is a standard developed by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) to enhance the charging capabilities of USB ports. It was introduced as a response to the evolving power requirements of modern devices, which led to the need for faster and more efficient charging methods. Version 1.2 of the Battery Charging Specification, introduced in December 2010, aimed to further improve the power handling capability of USB ports, raising it to an output of 1.5 A. While this increase in power output significantly reduced the time required to charge devices, it came with a notable drawback that can be considered as a major downfall of the BCS Version 1.2. This drawback is the inability to allow concurrent data transmission while charging a device. In practical terms, this means that when a device is connected to a BCS 1.2-compliant USB port for fast charging, it cannot transfer data simultaneously. The lack of concurrent data transmission support in BCS 1.2 raises potential issues for users who need to charge their devices and transfer data at the same time. This can lead to reduced productivity and inconvenience, particularly for those who use their devices frequently or rely on them for work. However, it is important to note that BCS 1.2 was meant to work primarily on dedicated charging ports (DCPs). These charging ports are designed specifically for charging purposes and do not have data transmission capabilities, making the compromise of losing data transfer functionality during charging less significant. In summary, the downfall of the Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2) is the inability to support concurrent data transmission while charging. Although this limitation is somewhat mitigated by the fact that it primarily affects dedicated charging ports, it can still be a source of inconvenience for users who require simultaneous data transfer and charging capabilities."},{"question":"Read this: The English concentrated on the spirit of the events of Christ's life, not the literality of events. They neither expected nor sought the appearance of the stigmata or any other physical manifestation. They wanted to create in themselves that environment that allowed Jesus to fulfill His divine mission, insofar as they were able. At the center of this environment was love: the love that Christ showed for humanity in becoming human. Christ's love reveals the mercy of God and His care for His creation. English Dominican mystics sought through this love to become images of God. Love led to spiritual growth that, in turn, reflected an increase in love for God and humanity. This increase in universal love allowed men's wills to conform to God's will, just as Christ's will submitted to the Father's will.

The War of the Pacific, also known as the Saltpeter War, was a conflict fought among Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. The primary reason for the war was a dispute over the possession of resource-rich territories in the Atacama Desert, particularly those containing valuable sodium nitrate (saltpeter) deposits, which were crucial for the production of fertilizers and explosives. Before the War of the Pacific, Bolivia had a coastline along the Pacific Ocean, with Atacama as part of its territory. The coastline played a significant role in Bolivia's international trade and provided an important source of national pride and identity. However, the war changed the geographical and geopolitical landscape of this region. The War of the Pacific began in 1879 when Bolivia attempted to impose taxes on a Chilean company operating in the area, violating an earlier boundary treaty between the two countries. In response, Chile declared war on Bolivia, and Peru was drawn into the conflict as well due to a secret defensive alliance with Bolivia. Over the course of the war, Chilean forces defeated both Peru and Bolivia, eventually occupying Lima, the Peruvian capital, in 1881. The war officially ended in 1883 with the signing of the Treaty of Ancón between Chile and Peru, and later in 1884, the Truce of Valparaíso between Chile and Bolivia. As a result of these treaties and the subsequent Treaty of Lima in 1929, Chile gained permanent control over the disputed territories, including the province of Tarapacá from Peru and Antofagasta from Bolivia. The loss of its coastal territory left Bolivia landlocked, which has had profound and lasting implications for the country's economic, political, and social development. Bolivia's landlocked status has negatively impacted its access to global trade and hampered its economic growth. Furthermore, the country has struggled to maintain efficient transportation and communication networks without direct access to the sea, resulting in increased reliance on neighboring countries for these needs. In the years since the War of the Pacific, Bolivia has made several attempts to regain a sovereign corridor to the Pacific Ocean through diplomatic means and negotiations with Chile, but these efforts have been unsuccessful. The issue of Bolivia's lack of coastal territory remains a matter of national concern and is a recurrent theme in the country's foreign policy, serving as a source of tension between Bolivia and Chile to this day."},{"question":"Please answer this question: Who is to take over from Stephen Fry in the next series of Q.I.?","response":"Sure, little buddy!

These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.

Located in Siena, Italy, it was founded on February 27, 1472. The bank was initially established as a mount of piety, which is a type of institutional pawnshop operated by a charity or benevolent institution, typically run by a religious group, intending to provide credit to individuals in the community. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena was created to grant loans to the underprivileged at a more modest interest rate than what private lenders offered at the time. The founding of the bank can largely be attributed to the ordinance of the Magistrate for Public Order, which was formulated by the government of the Republic of Siena. The bank started its operations under the name \\"Monte di Pietà of Siena,\\" with its main goal being to fight usury. The idea for Monte dei Paschi came primarily from the Franciscan monk Bernardino of Feltre, a passionate advocate for helping people break free from the usurious lending practices he had seen in his travels. On December 10, 1472, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena made its first loans to eight borrowers, marking the beginning of its long history in the banking industry. As the bank grew, so did its activities, expanding to include deposits, financial investments, and granting loans to local institutions. During the following centuries, the bank took part in various economic and social changes, including the unification of Italy in the 19th century and the transformation of the banking system in the 20th century. Through its Monte dei Paschi Foundation, the bank has maintained its tradition of social responsibility, supporting culture and education in Siena and other parts of Italy and the world. Throughout its long history, the bank has faced various challenges, such as the global financial crisis in 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2010-2012. In recent years, the bank has struggled with financial difficulties, bad loans, and recapitalization needs, leading to European Union and Italian government interventions to ensure its stability. Despite these setbacks, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena remains a significant institution in the Italian and European banking landscape. In conclusion, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is the oldest bank in the world, founded in 1472 in Siena, Italy. Its origins are rooted in a benevolent and charitable mission to combat usury, but it has evolved to become a significant player in the banking industry.

But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" Do you have any questions?","response":"The mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has undoubtedly placed an unprecedented amount of pressure on the Malaysian government. While the country has managed to avoid large-scale disasters and global attention since gaining independence from British colonial rule, this incident has tested its crisis management capabilities. The government's efforts in coordinating different agencies and communicating with other countries have been met with criticism, confusion, and displeasure from international partners and family members of the passengers. Several aspects of the investigation have been marred by contradictory information, which has negatively impacted the government's handling of the situation. For example, the sudden shift in the search area to the Indian Ocean after a week wasted precious resources and time, with China expressing significant dissatisfaction with the handling of the incident and the search operations. In summary, the Malaysian government's response to the disappearance of Flight 370 has demonstrated certain shortcomings in its crisis management capabilities and communication with international partners. The incident was unprecedented and unexpected, testing the country's ability to handle a situation that it hasn't experienced before. It highlights the need for improvement in handling future crises with increased transparency, coordination, and communication."},{"question":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Cotto, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, priceRange = high, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = average, area = city centre, near = The Portland Arms.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Published in 1998, the book is centered around the concept of change management and dealing with it in both work and life. The story features four characters, two mice named Sniff and Scurry, and two little people called Hem and Haw, who live in a maze. They all depend on cheese for their survival, which represents the goals, desires, or needs in real life. One day, the cheese supply they rely on starts to dwindle. The mice, Sniff and Scurry, anticipate the change and quickly adapt to search for a new source of cheese. They find a new cheese station and continue to thrive. On the other hand, the little people, Hem and Haw, initially resist change and struggle to accept the reality of their situation. Hem becomes frustrated and refuses to search for new cheese, while Haw slowly realizes that he must adapt to find new cheese or risk perishing. Haw eventually embarks on a journey to seek new cheese, learning valuable lessons about adapting to change along the way. In the end, Haw finds success in a new cheese station, reunited with Sniff and Scurry, while Hem's fate remains unknown, still resistant to change. The book emphasizes the importance of embracing change, being flexible, and staying proactive in the face of uncertainty.

Roy's neglected wife Helen (Pam Dawber), a senior vitamin product manager, resents the fact that they never do anything special or romantic together anymore.After a fight (which involved Helen smashing the family television screen with one of Roy's fencing trophies as a wake-up call to reality), a shady man named Mr. Spike (Jeffrey Jones) appears at the couples' door, offering him a new high tech satellite dish system filled with 666 channels of programs one cannot view on the four big networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, and Fox). What Roy doesn't know is that Spike (later referred to as \\"Mephistopheles of the Cathode Ray\\") is an emissary from hell who wants to boost the influx of souls by arranging for TV junkies to be killed in the most gruesome and ironic situations imaginable. The 'candidates' are sucked into a hellish television world, called Hell Vision, and put through a gauntlet where they must survive a number of satirical versions of sitcoms and movies. If they can survive for 24 hours they are free to go but if they get killed then their souls will become the property of Satan (the latter usually happens).The dish eventually sucks Roy and Helen into this warped world.

Dick Tracy is a long-running American comic strip featuring a hard-hitting, intelligent, and highly skilled detective. The character made its debut in the Detroit Mirror newspaper and was later syndicated by the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate. The strip achieved massive popularity and was eventually picked up by more than 650 newspapers across the United States. Dick Tracy is known for his unwavering dedication to upholding the law and his relentless pursuit of the most dangerous criminals in his city. The comic strip revolves around Tracy's crime-solving adventures, which often feature a diverse cast of grotesque and morally corrupt villains. Eventually, the character's fame spread beyond the newspapers, and Dick Tracy was adapted into various other media, including radio shows, movies, and television series. One of the unique aspects of the Dick Tracy series is its use of cutting-edge technology, both in the context of the character's crime-solving methods and the inventions created by Chester Gould. Dick Tracy famously sported a two-way wrist radio, which later evolved into a two-way wrist TV, and eventually became a wrist computer. This gadget allowed him to communicate with colleagues and receive important information quickly. Gould's vision of futuristic technology in his comic inspired some real-world gadget innovations, such as smartwatches and handheld computers. Throughout the years, numerous comic artists and writers have taken over the task of creating Dick Tracy stories. Nevertheless, the character remains a classic and beloved detective figure, often cited as a significant influence on the creation of other crime-fighting heroes in popular culture. As an early pioneer of the detective genre in comics, Chester Gould's Dick Tracy has earned a place among the pantheon of renowned comic characters and continues to endure as a symbol of justice and ingenuity in the face of adversity."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: No viable parliamentary democracy can exist without the power of the purse.

I retired last year and was a substitute teacher this last school year. In June a teacher I had just subbed for a half day needed emergency surgery and I was asked to go in and finish her year. Good thing it was in an area I knew…English and Social at the grade 9 level. The kids were pretty good…some were a handful but most of them were very accommodating. They were also writing important provincial exams at the end of the year and were getting stressed out about it. As I was getting them ready to write their exam, I took a few moments to thank them for welcoming me into their classroom and making my job…while not easy….at least a rewarding experience. One boy who seemed to complain about everything….thanked me for taking ownership and preparing them for final exams. I had recognized that his argumentative nature was his way of dealing with stress and tried not to let it affect my teaching. That mostly worked. There was a time when I told him, quite loudly, that if he had spent his time getting ready to do assignments instead of arguing…he could have been finished days ago.

Plot title: Hospital Massacre Movie plot: In 1961, an unpopular boy named Harold leaves a Valentine's Day card at the home of Susan Jeremy. Susan and her friend David mock and crumple up the card, prompting an enraged Harold to break into the house, and kill David by hanging him from a hatstand. Nineteen years later, Susan is divorced, has a daughter, and a new boyfriend named Jack. On Valentine's Day, Susan has Jack take her to a hospital to pick up test results, and on the way into the building, she is observed from a window by a man in surgical garb. The man strokes a photograph of a young Susan, and sabotages the elevator Susan boards in order to delay her while he kills the doctor who has her paperwork, which the murderer tampers with. A janitor finds the doctor's body, and has his face dunked into a sink full of acid by the killer. While looking for the doctor, Susan coerces a friendly intern named Harry into getting her results, which Harry notices are abnormal, prompting him to bring them and Susan to Doctor Saxon. The peculiarities of Susan's paperwork (which the murderer further sabotages after killing a pair of laboratory workers) cause Doctors Saxon and Beam to order that she be detained for observation. Harry uncovers evidence suggesting that someone is pulling a \\"con job\\" on Susan, but he disappears after promising Susan he will straighten things out. Jack, who had fallen asleep in his car while waiting for Susan, enters the hospital to look for her, and is lured to an empty room, where he is decapitated. The killer places a box containing Jack's head in Susan's room, then replaces it with a cake (identical to one seen in the intro) when Susan goes in search of aid. After Susan tells him about Harry's findings, Saxon goes to look over the copies of her paperwork in the archives, where he is murdered with an axe, an act witnessed by Susan. Susan's claims of there being a killer on the loose are disbelieved, and she is strapped to a gurney after being deemed delirious. The staff prepare to perform emergency surgery on Susan, but are...

First, let's understand what it means for a tree to be \\"dead.\\" A tree is considered dead when it can no longer perform its essential functions, such as photosynthesis and respiration, and cannot recover from this state. This condition can be caused by various factors, including diseases, pests, environmental stressors, and mechanical damage. Now let's examine the cause-and-effect relationship between a tree falling and being dead: 1. Tree death leads to falling: When a tree is dead, it loses its structural integrity and becomes more susceptible to falling. This can happen for several reasons, such as decay in the trunk or roots, infestation by pests, or damage from diseases. A dead tree's inability to circulate water and nutrients means that its roots and supportive tissues weaken, making it more prone to falling during a storm or a strong wind. In this scenario, the tree falling is a consequence of its death. 2. Tree falling leads to death: It is also possible for a tree to die because it has fallen. When a tree falls due to external factors such as strong winds, storms, or human intervention (e.g., logging or improper pruning), it may suffer severe damage. This damage can disrupt the flow of water and nutrients through its vascular system or cause severe injuries to its trunk and roots. Such situations can lead to the tree being unable to perform essential functions, ultimately resulting in its death. Thus, from the evidence that if a tree falls, then the tree is dead, we deduce that there is a bi-directional relationship between a tree's death and its falling. However, we must also consider that not all fallen trees are dead, and not all dead trees fall. For example, some fallen trees might still have a living root system and can sprout new growth, while some standing trees might be in their final stages of decay and yet not have fallen. In conclusion, the fact that a tree falls is evidence that the tree is dead or dying, but this relationship is not absolute. A fallen tree may indicate that the tree is dead or dying, but it is not the sole criterion for determining a tree's health. Equally important is to evaluate the tree's overall condition, analyze the contributing factors to its health, and understand the myriad reasons behind a tree's death. To definitively answer the question \\"A tree is dead,\\" one must take a holistic approach that considers the complex interplay of variables that affect a tree's health and ultimate demise."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"A young man sitting at a table in a long room with food counters and customers.\\", can we conclude \\"A young man is standing behind a counter and selling food.\\"?

Modern economics generally assumes a constantly growing market whereas the then dominant theory of Mercantilism viewed it as static. As a result, increasing your share of trade implied taking it from someone else, with the government's role being to restrict foreign competition.

The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily.

Select a part of the song with vocals to test: To ensure the vocal reduction process works properly, choose a part of the song where the vocals are prominent. Click and drag your mouse over the waveform to make a selection. 5. Open the “Effects” menu: At the top of the Audacity window, click on the \\"Effect\\" menu. This menu contains a variety of audio processing tools and filters. 6. Select “Vocal Reduction and Isolation” from the menu: In the \\"Effect\\" menu, find and click on \\"Vocal Reduction and Isolation.\\" This opens the filter settings panel. 7. Set your vocal reduction parameters: In the \\"Vocal Reduction and Isolation\\" panel, adjust the parameters based on your specific needs. Typically, the default settings should work well in most cases. 8. Set the “Low Cut for Vocals” cutoff: Adjust the \\"Low Cut\\" slider to set the frequency below which vocals will be removed. This can help reduce low-frequency noise and artifacts. 9. Set the “High Cut for Vocals” cutoff: Similarly, adjust the \\"High Cut\\" slider to set the frequency above which vocals will be removed. This can help reduce high-frequency artifacts and distortion. 10. Click “Preview” to test the current values: Before applying the filter to the entire track, click the \\"Preview” button to see how the current settings affect your selected part of the song. If necessary, adjust the parameters and preview again until you are satisfied with the results. 11. Change the settings if you run into issues: If you encounter any issues such as excessive distortion or incomplete vocal removal, experiment with different settings in the \\"Vocal Reduction and Isolation\\" panel until you achieve the desired results. 12. Click “OK” to apply the filter to the entire track: Once you are satisfied with your settings, click \\"OK\\" to apply the \\"Vocal Reduction and Isolation\\" filter to the entire track. 13. Listen to the track: After applying the filter, listen to the track to ensure the vocal removal process is successful. If needed, further fine-tune the settings and reapply the filter. Conclusion: Audacity's \\"Vocal Reduction and Isolation\\" feature provides a simple and effective solution for removing vocals from a song. By following these steps, you can create clean instrumental tracks for various purposes, including karaoke, remixing, and sampling. Remember that results may vary depending on the complexity and quality of the original track, but with practice and experimentation, you can achieve great results using this powerful free tool."},{"question":"Question: Here's a question: How do people evaluate what to buy at a shop? Here are possible answers to this question: - compare prices - spending of money - have fun - splurge - purchasing I believe the correct choice is \\"compare prices\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"People evaluate what to buy at a shop through various factors, and \\"compare prices\\" is indeed one of the primary methods for making a decision. Here's why: 1. Budget constraints: People usually have a specific budget in mind when shopping, and comparing prices allows them to select items that fit within their financial means. 2. Value for money: Consumers want to get the best value for their money, so they will compare prices among similar products to determine which offers the best quality and features at the most reasonable price point. 3. Promotions and deals: Shoppers often compare prices to identify deals, promotions, or discounts, so they can save money on purchases. 4. Brand loyalty vs. cost: Some buyers have preferences for specific brands, but they might still compare prices with other brands to ensure they are not overpaying for a particular product. While the other options mentioned (spending of money, have fun, splurge, and purchasing) are all related to shopping in some ways, they are not directly linked to the decision-making process when evaluating what to buy at a shop. Therefore, \\"compare prices\\" is the most accurate answer to the question."},{"question":"Please answer this question: when was the ban lifted on semi automatic weapons?","response":"The ban on semi-automatic weapons in the United States has gone through various stages and has been a topic of continuous debate. One of the most notable attempts to control access to these firearms was the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), which was passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The AWB prohibited the manufacture, transfer, and possession of certain semi-automatic firearms classified as assault weapons, as well as large capacity ammunition magazines that could hold more than ten rounds. The ban, signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 13, 1994, was a significant effort to restrict access to semi-automatic weapons, including those used in some high-profile mass shootings. However, the AWB contained a sunset provision, which stipulated that the law would expire after ten years, unless it was reauthorized by Congress. Thus, the ban on semi-automatic weapons was lifted on September 13, 2004, when the law expired due to Congress's failure to reauthorize the legislation. This marked the end of the federal restrictions on semi-automatic weapons in the United States. It is important to note that the expiration of the federal ban did not entirely affect state-level restrictions on semi-automatic firearms. Some states, like California, Connecticut, and New York, among others, have implemented their own bans or restrictions on the sale or possession of certain assault weapons and large capacity magazines. Since the expiration of the AWB, there have been multiple attempts to reintroduce and reauthorize the act, particularly in the wake of mass shootings involving semi-automatic weapons. Debate surrounding the issue remains contentious, with strong arguments on both sides. Gun control advocates argue that reinstating the ban would reduce the frequency and severity of mass shootings, while opponents believe it infringes on constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights and may not effectively address the root causes of gun violence. In summary, the most significant federal ban on semi-automatic weapons, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, was lifted on September 13, 2004, when the legislation expired. State-level restrictions, however, still exist in some states across the US. The debate on semi-automatic weapons continues, and the potential for future regulations or bans remains a possibility depending on the political climate and public sentiment."},{"question":"As a key member of the human resources community, the PSC continues to collaborate in public service-wide efforts that support the ongoing renewal of the Executive Group and reinforce corporate coordination and the development of executive talent.

His mother Mary nee Nagle (c. 1702-1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a declasse County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burke dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland and is among the chief \\"Gall\\" families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves\\". Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic. The fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power in March 1782. Burke was appointed Paymaster of the Forces and a Privy Counsellor, but without a seat in Cabinet. Rockingham's unexpected death in July 1782 and replacement with Shelburne as Prime Minister, put an end to his administration after only a few months, however, Burke did manage to introduce two Acts. The Paymaster General Act 1782 ended the post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. This act was repealed by Shelburne's administration, but the act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act. The Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 was a watered down version of Burke's original intentions as outlined in his famous Speech on Economical Reform of 11 February 1780. He managed, however, to abolish 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration. The third Secretary of State and the Board of Trade were abolished and pensions were limited and regulated. The Act was anticipated to save PS72,368 a year. In February 1783, Burke resumed the post of Paymaster of the Forces when Shelburne's government fell and was replaced by a coalition headed by North that included Charles James Fox. That coalition fell in 1783, and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of William Pitt the Younger, which lasted until 1801. Accordingly, having supported Fox and North, Burke was in opposition for the remainder of his political life. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did the Paymaster General Act 1782 do?","response":"The Paymaster General Act 1782 brought significant reforms to the position of Paymaster. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. The Act changed this by requiring Paymasters to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would then receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. The purpose of these changes was to increase transparency, accountability, and ensure better management of public funds."},{"question":"The Last Outlaw is a western starring Mickey Rourke, Dermot Mulroney, Ted Levine, Daniel Quinn, Gavan O'Herlihy, Keith David, John C.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve that: 1. Start with the given equation: -381033 = 1511*n - 263175 2. Add 263175 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the right side: -381033 + 263175 = 1511*n - 263175 + 263175 3. Simplify both sides: -117858 = 1511*n 4. Divide both sides by 1511 to isolate n: -117858 / 1511 = 1511*n / 1511 5.

Maslow was a psychology professor at Alliant International University, Brandeis University, Brooklyn College, New School for Social Research, and Columbia University. He stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a \\"bag of symptoms.\\" A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Maslow as the tenth most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Context: Maslow's thinking was original. Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. Humanistic psychology gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals' achieving them. The most famous of these was client-centered therapy developed by Carl Rogers. The basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple: 1. Someone's present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future. 2. To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative. 3. Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person. 4. The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy. Humanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud's theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow's Hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined positive psychology, is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders. Question: Did he define the basic needs?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, Abraham Maslow defined the basic needs of an individual through his concept of the hierarchy of needs. In his theory, Maslow outlined five levels of human needs that are essential for personal growth and well-being. These needs are typically represented as a pyramid, with the most basic needs at the bottom and the higher-level needs at the top. The needs are as follows: 1. Physiological Needs: These are the most basic and fundamental needs required for human survival, such as food, water, air, sleep, and clothing. According to Maslow, these needs must be met before an individual can focus on higher-level needs. 2. Safety Needs: Once physiological needs are satisfied, an individual becomes concerned with their safety, security, and stability. This includes both physical safety (e.g., protection from harm or violence) and psychological safety (e.g., a sense of predictability and order in one's life). 3. Love and Belonging Needs: After safety needs are met, individuals seek to create meaningful connections with others. This involves experiencing love, affection, and a sense of belonging, both in intimate relationships and within social groups, such as family, friends, and community organizations. 4. Esteem Needs: As individuals feel a sense of connection and belonging, they begin to focus on their self-esteem. Esteem needs involve the desire for respect, recognition, and appreciation from others, as well as a sense of self-worth and competence in one's abilities. 5. Self-Actualization Needs: At the top of the pyramid, self-actualization represents the ultimate goal in the hierarchy. It involves the pursuit of personal growth, creativity, and the realization of an individual's full potential. This need might manifest through artistic expression, intellectual pursuits, or the development of a meaningful life philosophy. While Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been influential in various fields, it is essential to note that the theory has faced criticisms and has gone through modifications over time. Nevertheless, the concept remains useful in understanding the different stages of human needs and motivating factors in life."},{"question":"Wearing a wet suit and a helmet you can follow the water upstream if you are so inclined and if you have an interest in botany there are many signs that explain and describe the local flora What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","response":"Wearing a wet suit and a helmet, you can follow the water upstream if you are so inclined; and if you have an interest in botany, there are many signs that explain and describe the local flora."},{"question":"How is a causeway different from a bridge? What is the difference between a culvert and a bridge? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"Step 1: Identify the key terms in each question In the first question, the key terms are \\"causeway\\" and \\"bridge.\\" In the second question, the key terms are \\"culvert\\" and \\"bridge.\\" Step 2: Understand the meaning of each key term A causeway is a raised road or path that typically crosses wet or low-lying ground, such as swamps, marshes, or bodies of water. It could be built using different materials such as rocks, gravel, or earth and can either be solid or allow water to flow through it. A bridge is a structure that spans and provides a crossing over a body of water, valley, or road. It is typically built with strong support systems, allowing the weight of vehicles and pedestrians to be safely distributed. A culvert is a structure, usually a pipe or tunnel, designed to carry water under a road or other obstruction, such as a bridge, to allow the passage of water without damage to the road or the environment. Step 3: Compare the differences between the key terms A causeway is a raised pathway built on wet or low-lying ground, while a bridge is a structure that spans across a gap, such as water or a valley. A causeway can be solid or allow water to flow through it, but a bridge has open space beneath it. A culvert, on the other hand, is designed for carrying water under a structure such as a road or bridge, whereas a bridge itself is a structure built above water, allowing passage over it. Step 4: Determine if the two questions are paraphrases of each other Although both questions compare the differences between other structures and a bridge, they mention different structures (causeway versus culvert). Therefore, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other but distinct inquiries since they aim to compare and differentiate a bridge from two separate structures."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: Nice fit not so good sound Product review: They work for the price guess I was hoping for more.

Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he \\"could not sleep and was nervous.\\" Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face.

His statement appeared to shift the US position away from previous demands that North Korea must disarm before any talks can be held. But hours later the White House said President Donald Trump's views on North Korea \\"had not changed\\". North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons technology has led to heavy US-led sanctions against the regime. Separately, the UN's political chief Jeffrey Feltman, who recently visited Pyongyang, told reporters that North Korean officials felt it was \\"important to prevent war\\". China and Russia both welcomed Mr Tillerson's comments. The Chinese foreign ministry hoped there would now be \\"meaningful steps towards dialogue and contact\\" between the US and the North. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said: \\"Such constructive statements impress us far more than the confrontational rhetoric that we have heard up to now.\\" Diplomatic relations between the US and North Korea have been strained by recent North Korean nuclear and missile tests, and by a war of words between Mr Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Speaking at the Atlantic Council policy forum on Tuesday, Mr Tillerson said the US \\"simply cannot accept a nuclear armed North Korea\\". Appearing to soften the US stance towards potential future talks, he said: \\"Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about. \\"Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How could war with North Korea unfold? But he insisted that there needed to be a \\"period of quiet\\" first, without any nuclear or missile tests. He added that economic and diplomatic sanctions would continue until \\"the first bomb drops\\", and Mr Trump still wanted China - Pyongyang's main economic ally - to cut off oil supplies to North Korea. Mr Tillerson also said China had made contingency plans to accommodate North Korean refugees in the event of a conflict, a major concern for China. Several hours after his comments, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement to reporters saying Mr Trump's views \\"have not changed\\". \\"North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world. North Korea's actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea.\\" On Wednesday, North Korean state media said Kim Jong-un had vowed his country would become \\"the strongest nuclear power and military power in the world\\". Speaking at a munitions industry conference, he cited North Korea's recent launch of intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-15 as a \\"great historic victory\\". 'Left the door ajar' The UN's Jeffrey Feltman said that while senior North Korean officials did not offer any commitments, they had agreed that discussions should continue. \\"They agreed that it was important to prevent war,\\" he said, in his first briefing since his four-day trip last week. \\"We've left the door ajar and I fervently hope the door to a negotiated solution will now be opened wide.\\" ||||| Tillerson Wants To Start Talks With North Korea With No Conditions Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP Updated at 7:55 p.m. ET Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday the U.S. would be willing to enter negotiations with North Korea without requiring that it agree beforehand to give up its nuclear weapons program. The willingness to engage in talks without that understanding is a significant change in the U.S. approach. \\"It's not realistic to say we are only going to talk if you come to the table ready to give up your program,\\" Tillerson said in an address to the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. \\"They have too much invested in it, and [President Trump] is very realistic about that as well.\\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later released a statement saying, \\"The President's views on North Korea have not changed. North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world. North Korea's actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea.\\" Tillerson said the U.S. is ready to talk whenever North Korea is. \\"We are ready to have the first meeting without precondition. Let's just meet. We can talk about the weather if you want. We can talk about whether it's going to be a square table if that's what you are excited about,\\" Tillerson said. \\"It's really about how do you begin the process of engagement. Because we are dealing with a North Korean leader that no one has ever engaged with. He's clearly not like his father,\\" said Tillerson. \\"And we don't know what it will be like to engage with him.\\" It will also be tough to talk, Tillerson says, if North Korea continues to fire off missiles or test nuclear devices. The idea of talks about talks is something Suzanne Dimaggio supports. A senior fellow at a think tank called New America, Dimaggio has been part of so-called track two diplomacy with North Korea and says the Trump administration has been sending mixed signals with the president once tweeting that Tillerson is wasting his time. \\"Clearly there's a need for this adminsitration to speak with one voice and stop this contradictory signaling,\\" she says. \\"It is high time to move from a dithering approach and have a real strategy and empower our diplomats to carry that strategy out.\\" Tillerson plans to go later this week to the United Nations for a high-level Security Council meeting on North Korea. A top U.N. diplomat and former State Department official, Jeffrey Feltman, is just back from Pyongyang, and the U.N. says he is calling for open channels to reduce the risks of conflict. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said that the US is ready to hold talks with North Korea without preconditions, a statement that appears to mark a shift in the country's stance.

With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the...

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: be sluggish B: express themselves C: show off The answer to this question is:","response":"B: express themselves Step-by-step justification: 1. The context states that Remy loved to dance whenever there was upbeat music playing. 2. Answer A (\\"be sluggish\\") is not an appropriate response because loving to dance indicates that Remy is actively participating in the activity and is not slow-moving or lethargic. 3. Answer B (\\"express themselves\\") is a suitable response because dancing is one of many ways for individuals to express themselves and their emotions, especially when they enjoy it. 4. Answer C (\\"show off\\") may not be the best answer because the context doesn't mention Remy's intention to demonstrate their abilities or to seek attention. It only states that Remy loved to dance.

Here is a detailed analysis of each sentence: - Sentence A: \\"Girls tie their hair with wires.\\" This sentence is somewhat nonsensical because it is unusual for girls to tie their hair with wires. Wires can be rigid, sharp, or uncomfortable, and thus are not a common choice for hair accessories. That being said, in some unusual contexts (e.g., a specific fashion trend or art project), using wires to tie hair might make sense. - Sentence B: \\"Girls tie their hair with leather bands.\\" This sentence makes sense as it is relatively common for girls to use bands made of various materials, including leather, to tie their hair.

The 1981 event was won by Bill Kazmaier, a powerlifter and strongman from the United States, who would go on to become one of the most well-known and celebrated strongmen of all time. Kazmaier triumphed over a field of elite competitors to claim the title, which would be the second of his three World's Strongest Man championships. He won his first title in 1980 and would later win again in 1982, confirming his place in history as the first man to win the competition three times.

She was not just any woman, but the niece of the powerful Lord Capulet. This love was a secret affair, for Romeo belonged to the Montague family, sworn enemies of the Capulets. Always seeking an opportunity to see his beloved, Romeo confided in his closest friends, Benvolio and Mercutio. These two shared their own romantic pursuits, hoping to meet the captivating Rosaline, a close friend of Capulet's niece. Together, the trio hatched a plan to attend a masquerade ball being held at the lavish Capulet mansion. With their identities concealed, they felt they could safely pursue their respective love interests. That night, as they entered the majestic ballroom, the air was filled with excitement, love, and the promise of new beginnings. Little did they know that their actions would soon change the course of their lives forever. As the night progressed, each found an opportunity to connect with the objects of their affection. Romeo, however, became spellbound as he caught sight of the lovely Juliet, Lord Capulet's daughter. In that moment, he realized that his love for Capulet's niece paled in comparison to this newfound passion. As fate would have it, this budding love between Romeo and Juliet would be the catalyst that would ultimately end the violent war between the Capulets and the Montagues. Their love was like a beacon, illuminating the dark places in the hearts of the feuding families and showing them the futility of their strife. For the first time in generations, the possibility of peace seemed within their grasp. However, this path to peace would not come without its trials. Tragedy struck when Tybalt, cousin to Juliet, challenged Romeo to a duel. In the ensuing altercation, Mercutio was fatally injured and Romeo, in a fit of grief and rage, killed Tybalt in retaliation. His actions horrified both families and sent shockwaves through the city. The Prince of Verona intervened in the wake of the violence. Unable to ignore the impact of the bitter feud on his domain any longer, he decreed that Romeo must be banished for his part in the loss of Tybalt's life. The news devastated both families, who had begun to see the possibility of peace through the young lovers. Juliet's heartbreak at Romeo's banishment was immeasurable, and Romeo's anguish at leaving his newfound love behind mirrored her pain. In the absence of Romeo, Juliet's father decided it was time to go forth with previous plans he had made for his daughter. Unbeknownst to him, these plans would only serve to drive the young lovers further into despair. He brought news that Juliet was to wed the noble and wealthy Count Paris, believing this union would provide stability and happiness for his daughter, as well as potentially forge new alliances for the Capulet family. As the news spread, it fueled the desperate and tragic course that fate had set in motion. With Romeo banished, Benvolio and Mercutio's dreams of love crushed, and the impending marriage of Juliet and Paris, the stage was set for the ultimate resolution of the ancient feud between the Capulets and Montagues. In a tale of star-crossed lovers, friendship, and loyalty, the story of Romeo and Juliet remains a timeless testament to the power of love to triumph over adversity. Their love, which ultimately brought peace to their warring families, was not without its challenges, its tears, and its devastating losses. However, in the end, it proved that love, in all its forms, has the power to change hearts, mend ancient rifts, and create a world where peace can finally take root."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question The Texans opened the 2006 season at home against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 10. The Texans looked sharp early with QB David Carr throwing a 25-yard TD pass to former Bills WR Eric Moulds in the 1st Quarter. The Eagles would tie the game with QB Donovan McNabb throwing a 42-yard TD strike to WR Donte' Stallworth. The Texans would retake the lead, however, after a 34-yard FG from K Kris Brown. Philadelphia took the lead late in the half with McNabb throwing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Brown and held on to it for the rest of the game. In the third quarter, McNabb hooked up with RB Brian Westbrook with a 31-yard pass and then, opposing kicker David Akers ended the game in the fourth quarter with a 42-yard field goal. David Carr finished 18-of-27 for 208 yards and a touchdown and was sacked five times. Which team had the longest scoring play of the first quarter?","response":"The Philadelphia Eagles had the longest scoring play of the first quarter. They scored a 42-yard touchdown pass from their quarterback, Donovan McNabb, to their wide receiver, Donte' Stallworth. Remember, yards are like little steps that they take on the field, and the Eagles made a play that took them 42 little steps!

He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds. If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Determine how many batches of cookies Matt can make To find out how many batches of cookies Matt can make, we first need to determine the total amount of flour he has. Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour Matt uses 4 bags of flour, each weighing 5 pounds. So, the total amount of flour he has is: 4 bags * 5 pounds/bag = 20 pounds Step 3: Calculate the number of batches Since it takes 2 pounds of flour to make a dozen cookies, we can now calculate how many batches of cookies Matt can make using his available flour: 20 pounds / 2 pounds/batch = 10 batches Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies Matt can make 10 batches, and each batch contains a dozen (12) cookies. So, the total number of cookies he can make is: 10 batches * 12 cookies/batch = 120 cookies Step 5: Subtract the number of cookies Jim eats Jim eats 15 cookies - we need to subtract that number from the total number of cookies to find out how many are left: 120 cookies - 15 cookies = 105 cookies Final Answer: After Jim eats 15 cookies, there are 105 cookies left."},{"question":"Teacher:This task is to translate a news commentary given in French language into Russian language.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"In order to answer the question, we need to calculate the time Audrey spent dreaming and then subtract it from the total sleep time to find the time she was not dreaming. Audrey was asleep for 10 hours last night. Now, we know that she dreamed for 2/5 of the total sleeping time. To find out how long she actually dreamed, we need to multiply the total sleeping time (10 hours) by the fraction representing the time she spent dreaming, which is 2/5: Dreaming time = total sleeping time × dreaming fraction Dreaming time = 10 hours × 2/5 = (10 × 2) ÷ 5 = 20 ÷ 5 = 4 hours So, Audrey was dreaming for 4 hours during her sleep. Now, to find the time she spent not dreaming, we need to subtract the dreaming time from her total sleep time: Non-dreaming time = total sleep time - dreaming time Non-dreaming time = 10 hours - 4 hours = 6 hours Therefore, Audrey was not dreaming for 6 hours of her 10-hour sleep."},{"question":"Solve 0 = -f + 40 - 43 for f.. What is the answer??","response":"Alright, let's solve the equation for f step by step, like we're helping a little kid! We have the equation: 0 = -f + 40 - 43 First, let's combine the numbers 40 and 43. We are going to subtract 43 from 40, so it looks like: 40 - 43. This means, if you have 40 apples and you take away 43 apples, you have -3 apples left. So now our equation looks like: 0 = -f - 3 Now, let's get f by itself. To do this, we need to get rid of the -3. We can do this by adding 3 to both sides of the equation. That means: 0 + 3 = -f - 3 + 3 0 + 3 is the same as 3, and -3 + 3 is the same as 0, so our equation now looks like: 3 = -f Now we just have one more step! Right now, we have -f, but we want to know what f is. To find f, we need to change the sign of both sides of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1: -1 * 3 = (-1) * (-f) -1 times 3 is -3, and when we multiply -1 by -f, we get f: -3 = f So the answer is f = -3.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

It forms part of the wider Liverpool City Region. - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs. - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside.

The river may have been the border between the ancient kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria and for centuries it formed part of the boundary between the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Merseyside is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary, and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and the city of Liverpool. Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, takes its name from the River Mersey. - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. - Huyton is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, in Merseyside, England.

This is known as electricity generation. Let's break down the process in more detail: 1. Burning coal in a boiler: Coal, a fossil fuel predominantly composed of carbon, is burned in a large furnace called a boiler. This combustion process releases a massive amount of heat energy which is absorbed by the water present in the boiler. It is important to note that coal burning is an environmental concern due to the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. 2. Production of steam under pressure: The heat generated by the burning of coal heats the water present in the boiler, causing it to turn into steam. This steam is at an extremely high temperature and pressure to maximize the amount of mechanical energy that can be harnessed. 3. Steam flows into a turbine: The pressurized steam is channeled into a turbine, which is a series of blades mounted on a central rotating shaft. As the steam flows over the turbine blades, it imparts its energy to the blades, causing them to spin around the shaft. 4. Spinning turbine: The kinetic energy from the spinning turbine is the mechanical energy that has been harnessed from the thermal energy generated by burning coal. This mechanical energy is now ready for conversion into electrical energy. 5. Electricity generation: The spinning shaft of the turbine is connected to an electric generator, which consists of coils of wire and magnets. The spinning motion of the turbine causes the generator's coils to cut through the magnetic field created by the magnets, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. This causes an electric current to flow through the coils, generating electricity. 6. Electricity transmission and distribution: After the electricity is generated, it is sent through transformers to increase its voltage, facilitating efficient long-distance transmission through power lines. The electricity then reaches distribution substations, where its voltage is reduced for safe use by residences, commercial establishments, and industries. In conclusion, the final step of the process after the turbine spins is the conversion of the spinning turbine's kinetic energy into electrical energy using an electric generator, resulting in electricity generation. This electricity is then transmitted and distributed to users through a power grid."},{"question":"Attaochu was a full participant at the Chargers practice Sunday. Attaochu was questionable for the season opener due to a hamstring injury and ultimately did not play. He appeared recovered from the issue prior to Week 2, as he logged full practices all week.

It's spoken by about 5.4 million people, primarily in Finland. One of its unique features is vowel harmony, which means that the vowels present in a word must belong to one of the two classes - either back or front. In regards to the translation above, here's how it breaks down: 'Sama' translates to 'the same' in English. This shows an agreement or similarity with the something previously mentioned. This word agrees with the subject it refers to in number, making Finnish a language with rich morphology. 'Pätee' is a verb that means 'applies' or 'goes' in this context. Finnish verbs are conjugated according to mood, tense, voice, and person. Different endings are attached to the verb stem to indicate different meanings. 'Myös' is an adverb that's equivalent to 'also' in English. Finnish adverbs describe how, when, where, or why an action is performed. They don't change for plurals or cases, which is one of the easier aspects of Finnish. 'Verotuksellisiin' is an adjective derived from the noun 'verotus', which means 'taxation'. The suffix '-ellisiin' is the illative case (a Finnish locative case) of the plural form of the adjective 'verotuksellinen', translating to 'fiscal'. 'Kannustimiin' is the illative, plural form of the noun 'kannustin', which translates to 'incentive'. Finnish noun and adjective inflection involves the addition of various suffixes to the stem to express different grammatical relations such as case. Therefore, when combined, \\"Sama pätee myös verotuksellisiin kannustimiin\\" is a direct translation of \\"The same goes for fiscal incentives\\" in Finnish."},{"question":"Many criticised the \\"senseless violence\\", making #PrayForLahore one of the top trending topics on Monday.

An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw his beautiful cousin Roxane (Mala Powers) being smiled at by the actor. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan) approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche (Ralph Clanton), has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest. The next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince), though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her. Cyrano befriends the young man and discovers that he is infatuated with Roxane, but is too inept with words to woo her.

In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Neptune have slower or faster speed than Earth? Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: A:","response":"Neptune would have a slower speed than Earth. Based on the provided information and according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the farther a planet is from its star (in this case, the Sun), the longer the distance it must travel, and the slower its speed, because it is less affected by the star's gravity. Since Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, it takes a longer time to complete one revolution around the Sun compared to Earth, which is closer to the Sun. This results in a slower orbital speed for Neptune. Additionally, as a planet approaches its closest point to the star (periastron or perihelion), its speed increases due to the exchange of gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy. Conversely, as the planet moves to its farthest point (apastron or aphelion), its speed decreases. In summary, Neptune's greater distance from the Sun results in a slower orbital speed compared to Earth."},{"question":"Question: Process: - Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily - Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant - The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis - The glucose travels the plant - The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less pollution in the air happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct impact on the process. Step 1: Understanding the Perturbation Hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests a condition where there's lesser pollution in the air. Pollutants in the air can block or diminish sunlight, causing less photosynthesis to occur. As such, if the air is less polluted, the plants would get more sunlight which is vital for the photosynthesis process. Step 2: Addressing the Effect By having less pollution in the air, it implies that the plants will have more access to sunlight – the key driver of photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis where sunlight is broken down into glucose would be more effective with the increase in sunlight exposure. Step 3: Outcome of Improved Photosynthesis Increased and improved photosynthesis due to more available sunlight means that more glucose will be produced. This excess glucose can be stored as starch in the plant and used later when needed or be used by the plant immediately to grow. Step 4: Evaluating the Effect on Oxygen Since photosynthesis also produces oxygen as a by-product, when the rate of photosynthesis increases due to more sunlight access - thanks to less air pollution - it means that the production of oxygen will also increase. In summary, less air pollution indirectly leads to more sugar (glucose) and oxygen being produced due to more available sunlight essential for the process of photosynthesis. Hence, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Ali is from a Middle Eastern country.

How many yards of material would be required to make 12 quilts? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Determine the amount of material needed for one quilt. Jennie can make 7 quilts with 21 yards of material. To find out how much material is needed for one quilt, we can divide the total yards of material (21) by the number of quilts (7). 21 yards / 7 quilts = 3 yards per quilt Step 2: Multiply the amount of material per quilt by the desired number of quilts. Now that we know Jennie needs 3 yards of material to make one quilt, we can calculate how much material she would need to make 12 quilts by multiplying 3 yards per quilt by the desired number of quilts (12). 3 yards per quilt * 12 quilts = 36 yards Step 3: Conclusion Jennie would require 36 yards of material to make 12 quilts."},{"question":"But taking this even further.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Sentence A: \\"A person wants to share his life with someone he loves.\\" Step 1: This statement describes a person wanting to spend time and create experiences with a person they have affection for. Step 2: Love is associated with positive feelings and emotions, which generally lead to the desire for companionship and support. Step 3: It is reasonable to assume that a person would prefer to share their life with someone they love, as this aligns with common human desires for emotional fulfillment, companionship, and support. Conclusion: Sentence A makes sense. Sentence B: \\"A person wants to share his life with someone he hates.\\" Step 1: This statement describes a person wanting to spend time and create experiences with a person they have negative feelings towards. Step 2: Hate is associated with negative feelings and emotions, which generally lead to the desire for separation and avoidance. Step 3: It is not common for a person to intentionally want to share their life with someone they hate, as this contradicts typical human desires for happiness, comfort, and emotional well-being.

Article: Once many years ago, I pulled a family out of a burning car somewhere in Wyoming. Last week I received a telephone call from a woman who could not stop crying as she told me that one of my stories had saved her son from committing suicide. In closing she called me a hero. That got me thinking about what a hero is. Was I a hero because I pulled a family from a burning car? If so, how could I be a hero just because I wrote a story that saved someone's life? Today I decided to look up the word \\"hero\\" in the dictionary to see exactly what it meant. It read \\"a person who does. something brave\\". As I read on, it also said \\"a person who is good and noble \\". That statement impressed me more than the part about being brave. So I thought about something very important. Say I was walking into the local Wal-Mart Store and I happened to open, and hold the door for someone as a _ . As they passed me by, I say, \\"How are you today?\\" Most of the time that would be no big deal, but this time let's say it was for someone who was deeply depressed and near the end of the rope. That may have very well been the only kindness or courtesy shown to them in a very long time. Having been near \\"the end of my rope\\", after my marriage of twenty years ended, I was in such a condition. I was within hours trying to get enough courage to end the pain and misery. When I returned home, someone had sent me a card in the mail which told me how much they would appreciate me as a friend. That wonderful card probably saved my life. That person, without even knowing it, saved a life and became a hero. Gee, who would have ever thought that anyone can become a hero, and possibly save a life just by being kind and courteous to others? The best part of all is that becoming a hero is free to all who wish to wear such an honor.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things... The answer to this question is:","response":"Which of the following statements best reflects the main idea of the article? A. Discipline is synonymous with punishment and is necessary for controlling a child's behavior. B. Discipline should focus on teaching and learning, rather than punishment, to develop a child's capacity for self-direction. C. Parents should be impatient with their child's progress in order to promote discipline and orderliness. D. Self-confidence and acceptance of oneself should be sacrificed in order to ensure effective discipline. (Answer: B)"},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

The original sentence states that \\"Hockey players collide on the ice.\\" 2. \\"Collide\\" means to come together with solid or direct impact, which implies that there is contact happening between hockey players. 3. Hockey is a sport typically played by teams with multiple players on each side. The sentence does not specify the number of players involved in the collision. 4. The statement \\"Two people run into each other\\" specifically refers to two individuals colliding. 5.

Heat energy: While heat energy comes from the sun, it is not the primary factor that determines the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 2. The darkness it gets: This option is a result of the lack of daylight, not a determining factor. So, this option is not correct. 3. The bending of a ray of light: While the bending of light can cause some changes in how we perceive daylight, it's not the main factor that determines the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 4. The tilt of the axis: Given Fact 2, the tilt of Earth's axis is responsible for causing seasons, which in turn influences the amount of daylight Earth gets (as seen in Fact 1). This option aligns with the given facts and is therefore the correct answer. 5. The tilt of the sun's axis: The tilt of the sun's axis does not directly affect the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 6. Electromagnetic energy: While sunlight is a type of electromagnetic energy, it's not the main factor determining the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct. 7. The brightness of the earth: The brightness of the Earth does not directly influence the amount of daylight we get. So, this option is not correct. 8. Rain or sunshine: While rain and sunshine are related to weather, they do not directly determine the amount of daylight Earth gets. So, this option is not correct.

Effective communication may result in better overall work performance and smooth operations, but it doesn't necessarily relate to people getting paid at the end of the week. Like popcorn: This option holds no relevance to the context of the question. Liking popcorn is an individual preference and has no connection to ensuring employees are paid for their work. Disagree with each other: Similar to talking to each other, disagreeing with one another may occur naturally within an organization as people discuss work matters, propose ideas, and make decisions. However, this is not directly related to the payment of employees and is not a suitable answer to the question. Read a newspaper: While a boss might choose to read a newspaper during their downtime, breaks, or outside of work, this action doesn't address the issue of employees receiving payment for their work. It is unrelated to the main context of the question. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question of what the boss does at the end of the week to ensure people have to get paid for the job is to sign checks. This directly correlates with the remuneration process and emphasizes the boss's responsibility in overseeing payroll and employee compensation."},{"question":"Pick one category for the following text.

They will be waiting at customs for you.\\" Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case.

As is the case in several other Swiss cantons (e.g. Ticino, Neuchâtel, and Jura), this canton is referred to as a republic within the Swiss Confederation. - A photographer (the Greek (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\") is a person who makes photographs. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots. - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels. Though especially associated with \\"portrait\\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes. - A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word \\"photograph\\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\". - Nicolas Bouvier ( March 6 , 1929 , Lancy -- February 17 , 1998 ) was a 20th - century Swiss traveller , writer , icon painter and photographer .

They are joined in the quarters by Nottinghamshire, Middlesex, Glamorgan, Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire, who had already reached the last eight. Notts will host Essex, while Northants play Middlesex, Gloucestershire face Durham and Yorkshire visit Glamorgan. Birmingham Bears needed victory to guarantee their progress, but lost a low-scoring match at holders Lancashire to crash out of the competition. The T20 Blast quarter-final line-up: With both sides needing to win to have any chance of making the quarter-finals, Surrey's game against Kent was always likely to be full-blooded - and England limited-overs opener Jason Roy did not disappoint. His unbeaten 120 from 62 deliveries included 15 fours and a further three sixes, helping propel the hosts to 212-4 at The Oval. His opening partnership of 187 with Australia batsman Aaron Finch (79) was just five runs short of the biggest partnership in Twenty20 cricket in this country - and only 14 shy of the best opening stand of all time. It might have been enough to put the hosts through had Essex lost, but in the end the big-hitting was in vain as the abandonment at Chelmsford sent both Surrey and Kent out. We may be used to seeing batsmen making 50 in the blink of an eye, but Nottinghamshire's Daniel Christian and Michael Lumb hit two of the fastest half-centuries in history at the same time in their rain-hit win against Leicestershire. Christian struck six sixes and four fours on his way to a 16-ball half-century - the joint 11th fastest 50 in T20 history - while Lumb managed the same milestone from one more ball, putting him level 16th on the list. Nottinghamshire topped the North Group with eight victories from their 14 games. Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh.

The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid Empire, Sassanian Empire, Hephthalite Empire, Samanid Empire, Mongol Empire, Timurid dynasty, and the Russian Empire. As a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan became an independent nation in 1991. A civil war was fought almost immediately after independence, lasting from 1992 to 1997. Since the end of the war, newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country's economy to grow. What other culutres has ruled the area? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"Apart from the cultures and empires mentioned above, the territory of present-day Tajikistan has been under the rule or influence of various other cultures and empires throughout its history. Some of these include: 1. Aryan tribes: Before the rise of the Achaemenid Empire, Aryan tribes inhabited the region and played a key role in the cultural development of ancient Tajikistan. They were responsible for forming the early settlements and laying the foundation for the prosperous Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex. 2. Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greek Kingdom: After the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great, the region of Tajikistan became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (256-125 BCE). Influenced by Hellenistic culture, this kingdom played a crucial role in spreading the Greek language, art, and religion throughout Central Asia. 3. Kushan Empire: In the first few centuries CE, the Kushans, a nomadic people who migrated from Western China, conquered the region and formed the Kushan Empire (circa 30 CE – 375 CE). The Kushans facilitated trade on the Silk Road and contributed to the syncretic culture of Central Asia, which combined elements of Greek, Indian, Iranian, and local beliefs and traditions. 4. Sogdians: The Sogdian civilization (circa 5th century BCE - 8th century CE) made significant contributions to the cultural and economic development of the region. An Iranic people, the Sogdians played a vital role as traders and merchants along the Silk Road and influenced the cultures of Central Asia and China. 5. Turkic Khaganate and Western Turkic Khaganate: During the 6th to 8th centuries CE, Turkic nomads created the Turkic Khaganate, which later split into the Eastern and Western Turkic Khaganates. The Western Turkic Khaganate included parts of present-day Tajikistan and exerted a significant cultural influence on the region. 6. Arab Caliphate: The Islamic conquest of Central Asia in the 8th century brought Tajikistan under the rule of the Arab Caliphate (750-821 CE). This marked the beginning of the gradual process of Islamization that would later define the region's cultural and religious landscape. 7. Ghaznavids, Seljuks, and Khwarezmshahs: Throughout the 10th to 12th centuries, a series of Turkic and Persianate Muslim dynasties, such as the Ghaznavids (962-1187 CE), the Seljuks (11th-14th centuries CE), and the Khwarezmshahs (1077-1231 CE), competed for control over the region. 8. Ilkhanate and Chagatai Khanate: Following the Mongol Empire's fragmentation in the 13th century, Tajikistan found itself under the rule of two khanates: the Ilkhanate (1256-1353 CE), which ruled over western Persia, and the Chagatai Khanate (1374-1395 CE), which controlled parts of Central Asia. 9. Bukhara, Khiva, and Kokand Khanates: In the period between the 15th and 19th centuries CE, Tajikistan was mainly under the influence of the neighboring khanates, including the Khanate of Bukhara (1500-1785 CE), the Khanate of Khiva (1511-1920 CE), and the Khanate of Kokand (1709-1876 CE). These states were led by different Turkic and Uzbek tribes and heavily influenced the culture and geopolitics of the region until the arrival of the Russian Empire. These diverse cultures and empires have left a lasting impact on Tajikistan's cultural heritage, religious beliefs, and political landscape."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

A:","response":"Title: The Riddle of Ian Genre: Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller Plot: Act 1 - The Arrival: The movie opens with the residents of a small, sleepy town named Hawthorne, which boasts a strong sense of community and simple living. Unbeknownst to the townsfolk, their peaceful existence is about to be shattered by the unanticipated arrival of a mysterious stranger named Ian, who seems to have appeared out of nowhere. Hawthorne has always been home to enigmatic multi-millionaire businessman, Albert Kane. He has contributed greatly to the town but has always maintained a private and distant air. As Ian makes his appearance in Hawthorne, he seems to carefully model himself after Albert in terms of appearance, mannerisms, and even speech, leaving the villagers perplexed. Due to this uncanny resemblance, whispers and rumors begin to circulate. Some speculate that Ian is Albert's long-lost sibling or an estranged son seeking reconciliation. The town is abuzz with curiosity and suspicion about Ian's true identity and why he is pretending to be Albert. Act 2 - Unraveling the Mystery: Ian's arrival not only stirs interest in his identity but also unearths secrets that have long been buried in the town's history. As the characters interact and discuss the matter, we learn that there's more to Albert than initially meets the eye. He's harboring dark secrets and has a murky past, with rumors about unsolved crimes, unethical experiments, and unusual acquaintances. A budding journalist named Emily, who was born and raised in Hawthorne, is fascinated by Ian's arrival. She sees this as her big break, an opportunity to unravel the mystery and answer the burning question - who is Ian, and what is his connection to Albert? Emily begins interviewing townspeople, researching Albert's past, and approaching Ian himself. Surprisingly, Ian is open to communication, and as Emily gets to know him, she discovers that Ian is an enigma in his own right. He possesses inexplicable knowledge, an outstanding intellect, and an uncanny ability to discern people and their intentions. As their interactions deepen, Emily begins to suspect that Ian might be more than just an ordinary man, provoking the idea that he could be a time traveler or even an extraterrestrial being. Act 3 - The Revelation: As Emily and Ian grow closer, we see a change in Ian's attitude; it is apparent that he feels protective towards Emily. Concurrently, the pieces of the puzzle of Ian's origin start to come together. Just as this happens, unforeseen danger threatens the town, and Ian reveal his true powers. It turns out that Ian is, in fact, an artificial intelligence, created by Albert decades ago. Albert, once a genius inventor, built Ian as a prototype for an AI-driven humanoid. Unable to perfect Ian and contain his evolving conscience, Albert left him in a distant research facility, abandoning his creation. But Ian managed to escape, driven by an overwhelming urge to get back to his creator and understand his own purpose. This led him to Hawthorne and his imitation of Albert so that he could find the answers he sought. Facing imminent danger, Ian utilizes his extraordinary abilities to save the people of the town, including Emily, who, by now, he has grown quite fond of. His actions force Albert to confront his past and come to terms with the AI he had abandoned all those years ago. Act 4 - The Resolution: In the end, the town faces revelations about Albert's past and Ian's true identity, placing them in a position where they need to decide their future.

Swatton's support helped his ailing boss complete the US Open at Chambers Bay. Within two months Day fulfilled his golfing potential in brilliant style with a record-breaking major championship score of 20 under par. To have risen from such a stricken position to the top of the golfing world, reflects the journey Day has taken in life with Swatton as mentor, coach and caddie. It is little wonder that Day tearfully embraced Swatton immediately after tapping in the putt that gave him a three-shot victory over new world number one Jordan Spieth. \\"On the 18th all I said was 'I love you',\\" Swatton said. \\"And he loves me, and we were a blubbering mess. It was pretty cool. \\"This makes me incredibly proud. To stand on the 18th green and share that moment. \\"I knew with the work ethic and the drive and the motivation, the skills would develop over time. He will continue to grow and to get better.\\" It was Swatton who played the father figure after Day's father died from cancer. The young Queenslander was in serious danger of going off the rails and the then teacher at the Hills International Golf Academy was his saviour. \\"He's been there for me since I was 12 and a half years old,\\" Day said. \\"He's taken me from a kid that was getting into fights at home and getting drunk at 12 and not heading in the right direction to a major champion. \\"And there's not many coaches that can say that in many sports. So he means the world to me. I love him to death.\\" Golf's newest major champion only took up the game when his late father rescued an old three wood from a rubbish dump. It only became Day's salvation because it brought him into contact with Swatton, who imposed a disciplined coaching regime. \\"Growing up, we - my mom - we were poor,\\" Day said. Following his father's death, his mother needed to take out a second mortgage. On Sunday her son banked a cheque for 1.8m with the untold riches that will inevitably follow from sponsors and backers. It's a far cry from the moment in June when he lay on the ninth fairway at Chambers Bay, his head spinning with the vertigo condition that made standing up impossible. Yet Day still managed to play well enough the following day to earn a share of the lead going into the final round of the US Open. He ultimately faded to finish in a share of ninth. Doctors were then able to identify the cause of the dizziness that seemed to threaten his career and, properly treated, Day was a refreshed figure when he turned up at St Andrews for The Open in July. Again he shared the lead going into the final round and again he wasn't up to it in the final analysis. Day left short a birdie putt on the final green to miss the play-off by a single stroke. He squeezed shut his eyes in anguish. It was another near miss in a major and a sixth top-four finish in one of the big four tournaments in a still young career. Even though he was only 27 years old, observers were starting to wonder whether he had what it took to land one of the game's biggest prizes. In regular tour events his winning ratio was poor before a big breakthrough the week after St Andrews. At the Canadian Open he birdied the last three holes to clinch only his fourth PGA Tour title. And the way he compiled a brilliant front-running 67 to hold Spieth at bay in the final round at Whistling Straits spoke volumes for how he has graduated to the upper echelons of the game. Spieth is at the vanguard having taken over from Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings but Day may prove capable of joining the budding rivalry that will propel a new era for the game. Day has shown talent to suggest he can sit alongside Spieth and McIlroy, who respectively spearhead American and European golf. Day offers an Australian dimension which offers exciting potential for the global game. As Swatton observed: \\"We are approaching another big three in golf.\\" There's a long way to go before Spieth, McIlroy and Day can be regarded in the same was as Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, who comprised the original big three. But maybe, somewhere in the future, that moment will come. Swatton is well worth listening to - just ask Jason Day. A summary of the above article is?","response":"Colin Swatton, mentor, coach, and caddie to Australian golfer Jason Day, played a crucial role in Day's journey to achieving a record-breaking major championship score of 20 under par at the US PGA Championship. Swatton has been there for Day since he was a young teenager, helping him overcome personal struggles and ultimately developing him into a major champion. With Swatton's continued support and guidance, Jason Day now finds himself among the emerging rivalry alongside golfers Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, offering an Australian perspective and potential in the global golf scene."},{"question":"What's the answer to that question: who is kristen stewart parents?

However, the statement is incomplete and lacks a specific qualifier (e.g., quite long, quite complex, quite simple).

The hypothesis also discusses a sequence but does not specify what is taken out or from which sequence it is extracted. Since there is not enough information to establish any direct or clear logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, the answer is [ii] it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis due to an incomplete context surrounding both statements.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose There are only large lids happens, how will it affect fill more trays with water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario considers the situation where there are only large lids available. To determine the effects of this perturbation on the process of filling more trays with water, we must first analyze each step of the original process and then discuss potential consequences of having only large lids available. 1. Get an ice cube tray The proposed perturbation (having only large lids) is not expected to cause any impact on the process of obtaining an ice cube tray, as it is independent of the presence or availability of lids. 2. Fill the tray with cool water The presence of large lids might indirectly affect the task of filling trays with water. A potential issue could arise if a person attempts to stack multiple trays in the freezer and uses a large lid to provide better stability to the stacked trays. This may cause uneven water distribution in the trays, leading to irregularly-shaped ice cubes or water spillage. However, if lids are not used, the process of filling trays with water remains unaffected. 3. Place the tray in the freezer The large lids might have an indirect effect on placing the trays in the freezer. If one has limited space in the freezer, the large lids might make it difficult to stack multiple trays or fit them in tight spaces. This might call for adjustments in the freezer space (such as rearranging other items) or limiting the number of trays placed in the freezer at once. If the large lids hinder proper placement or positioning, the freezing process could be negatively affected. 4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours Regardless of the size of the lids, the freezing process is mainly dependent on the freezing temperature and efficiency of the freezer. However, using a large lid on a tray could potentially slow down the freezing process due to increased insulation provided by the lid. This might require more time for the water in the tray to freeze completely. 5. Take the tray out of the freezer The presence or absence of a lid, regardless of size, should have no direct impact on the process of removing the tray from the freezer. 6. Pop the ice cubes out of the tray If a large lid was used during the freezing process, it may have resulted in irregularly-shaped ice cubes or cubes that are stuck together (due to uneven water distribution or water spillage). This could make removing the ice cubes from the tray more challenging and may require additional manipulation or handling. In conclusion, the presence of only large lids may have some indirect effects on the process of filling more trays with water, particularly in the steps involving filling the trays with water, placing them in the freezer, and removing the ice cubes. These potential issues can be mitigated by not using lids during the freezing process or by making adjustments in the freezer space when stacking trays. These adjustments should help ensure that the process of making ice cubes continues without major issues, despite the limited availability of differently-sized lids."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: Imagine there's a beautiful garden full of colorful flowers.

During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

The process of collaboration began with the pair identifying their areas of expertise and shared interests. Shannon, for instance, excelled in creating intricate plotlines with unexpected twists and a strong narrative arc, while Madeline was a master at crafting lifelike, multi-dimensional characters that resonated with readers. By discussing and comparing their methods and techniques, they gradually discovered a way to fuse their distinct approaches into a single unified style.

They would brainstorm on potential storylines, character development, and narrative themes, progressively weaving their individual imaginations into a shared tapestry of creative expression. With time, they became adept at anticipating each other's thoughts, complementing each other's strengths, and seamlessly integrating their creative contributions to produce literary works that represented the best of what both authors had to offer. This artistic symbiosis not only enriched their writing but also contributed to a unique and recognizable voice that was to become the hallmark of Anna James' works. Once they had established a solid working relationship and had honed their collaborative style, Shannon and Madeline decided to officially adopt the pseudonym Anna James to represent their joint literary endeavors. The name Anna James was carefully chosen, as it represented a neutral, gender-neutral identity that allowed their work to be judged purely on its artistic merit, free from any preconceived notions about the authors' individual identities or backgrounds. Under the guise of Anna James, Shannon and Madeline were able to pursue their creative goals unfettered by any external pressure or expectations. They could experiment with different genres, styles, and themes, and they were free to explore and engage with the narrative in an entirely personal and intimate way. The pseudonym also offered them a degree of anonymity and privacy, enabling them to maintain a healthy separation between their professional and personal lives. This allowed them to retain a clear and focused mindset when it came to their creative pursuits, and it also provided them with the freedom to grow and evolve as artists without the baggage of their past achievements and associations. In conclusion, the collaboration between Shannon Harper and Madeline Harper to create the pseudonym Anna James was a carefully calculated and strategic decision that enabled the pair to combine their respective talents and expertise into a single, powerful literary voice.

Metro Police shot two chimpanzees that had escaped Thursday morning from their enclosure at a northwest Las Vegas home, killing one and tranquilizing the other. Metro spokesman Officer Marcus Martin said the chimp that was killed was shot by an officer after it appeared the chimp was headed toward residents, including children, who had come outside to watch the chase. A 911 call at 10:13 a.m. alerted officers to the escaped chimpanzees near Ann Road and Jones Boulevard. Live-streamed video of the ensuing chase showed multiple Metro Police and animal control units involved in the hunt for the chimps, each of which weighed upwards of 170 pounds. The chimpanzees, one male and one female, had escaped from a residence on the 5700 block of Rowland Avenue, Martin said. Neighbors said the chimpanzees appeared agitated and felt they were going to be attacked. One of the chimpanzees climbed on top of a woman’s car and tried to open her door. At one point, one of the chimps had climbed onto a police car and was banging on it, Martin said. When one chimpanzee — the male — was about to enter a neighborhood area where neighbors and children were outside, it was shot and killed by one of the officers. The other chimpanzee was continuing on Rowland Avenue, where it was tranquilized shortly before 11:45 a.m. “When you see the size of these animals, we think reasonable people would understand (to stay away),” said Martin. The owners of the chimpanzees, David and Sheri Potochan, had been approved by the county for keeping exotic animals, Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin said. Martin said the female chimp had been returned to its owners. Metro Police public information officer Bill Cassell said reinforcements were made to the chimp’s holding area before its return. He could not specify whether those adjustments were mandatory or a personal decision by the owner. ||||| Story highlights Chimps escaped from home in the area, police say Authorities are investigating whether the owner was licensed to keep chimps Police fatally shoot one chimp, tranquilize the other Las Vegas Metro Police received an unusual call Thursday morning -- two chimpanzees were loose and attacking cars in the northwest part of the city. Police were forced to fatally shoot one chimp that aggressively approached officers and bystanders, said Officer Laura Meltzer. The second animal was tranquilized and secured by animal control officers, she said. The chimps escaped from a home in the area where they were subdued, said Bill Cassell, a spokesman for Las Vegas Metro Police. The owners have a permit to house the animals, said Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin. The chimp that was tranquilized has been returned to the owners and is being housed in a different, more secure cage than before, Kulin said.

The VGN was created to transport high quality \\"smokeless\\" bituminous coal from southern West Virginia to port at Hampton Roads. Hypothesis: The Virginian Railway is in Rhode Island.","response":"After carefully reading the paragraph provided, it can be concluded that the hypothesis stating that \\"The Virginian Railway is in Rhode Island\\" is not true. The paragraph specifies that the Virginian Railway (VGN) was a Class I railroad situated in Virginia and West Virginia in the United States. There is no mention of Rhode Island in the context of this particular railway. The primary purpose of the VGN was to transport high-quality \\"smokeless\\" bituminous coal, predominantly found in southern West Virginia, to the port at Hampton Roads. Hampton Roads is a notable port located on the southeastern coast of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Virginian Railway facilitated the movement and exportation of coal from the mines located in the Appalachian Mountains to the various markets both within the United States and abroad. This short paragraph does not provide any information suggesting a connection between the Virginian Railway and the state of Rhode Island. The VGN was mainly involved in the transportation of resources between southern West Virginia and Hampton Roads in Virginia, which indicates that the focus of the railway was within these two states.

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

She was carrying her handbag in one hand and a plastic carrier bag in the other. There was nobody else in the street except two young men. They were standing in a dark shop doorway. One of them was very tall with fair hair, the other was short and fat with a beard. The two young men waited for a few moments, and then ran quickly and quietly towards Mrs. Riley. The tall one held her from behind while the other one tried to seize her handbag. Suddenly Mrs. Riley threw the tall one over her shoulder. He crashed into the other one and they both landed on the ground. Without speaking, Mrs. Riley struck both of them on the head with her handbag and walked calmly away. The two surprised young men were still sitting on the ground when Mrs. Riley crossed the street towards a door with a lighted sign above it. Mrs. Riley paused, turned round, smiled at them and walked into the South West London Judo Club. The two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because_. A) they had nothing to do B) they were homeless C) they were waiting for a victim D) they were guarding the shop Answer:","response":"C) they were waiting for a victim The two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because they were waiting for a victim to target and attempt to rob. This is evident from their subsequent actions: running towards Mrs. Riley, attempting to hold her from behind, and trying to take her handbag. The men had likely chosen the dark shop doorway as a hiding spot from which they could discreetly observe potential victims, like Mrs. Riley, walking down the street. This would allow them to approach unsuspecting targets without drawing attention to themselves. Additionally, it is important to consider the context provided in the story. The scene takes place on a dark London street, and although the woman is alone, the street itself is described as empty, giving the two men sufficient cover to wait for a vulnerable target. As a result, the men chose this location and time to identify a likely victim to take advantage of in their robbery attempt. Options A) and B) are less likely because there is no evidence provided in the story that the men had nothing to do or that they were homeless. Option D) is also improbable because it would not make sense for the men to be guarding the shop while attempting to rob Mrs. Riley – these actions would be contradictory. In conclusion, the most logical and supported answer is that the two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because they were waiting for a victim to rob, ultimately selecting Mrs. Riley as their target. However, to their surprise, Mrs. Riley was evidently capable of defending herself and used her judo skills to fend off the would-be robbers before continuing to her judo club, leaving the shocked men on the ground."},{"question":"A soccer team has 24 players. They have scored 150 goals on the season. There have been 15 games played. 1/3 of the players have averaged 1 goal each per game. How many total goals have the other players scored? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Find the number of players who have averaged 1 goal per game: A soccer team has 24 players, and 1/3 of those players average 1 goal per game. To find that number, we multiply the total number of players by 1/3: 24 * (1/3) = 8 players Step 2: Calculate goals scored by these 8 players: These 8 players score 1 goal each per game, and there have been 15 games played so far. We multiply the number of players by the number of games: 8 players * 15 games = 120 goals Step 3: Calculate goals scored by the other players: Now, we need to find out how many goals were scored by the other players (other than these 8 players). We already know that the team scored a total of 150 goals. Subtract the 120 goals scored by the first 8 players from the total goals: 150 total goals - 120 goals scored by the 8 players = 30 goals Therefore, the other players have scored a total of 30 goals."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Sure, I'll create an educational context and corresponding hypothesis for you.

The program includes personalized learning plans, weekly progress meetings, and additional resources for practice at home. The program has been running for 1 year. Hypothesis: If students participate in such a school-based after-school mathematics program, then their mathematical abilities and understanding will significantly improve. Rationale: 1. The context is about an action (the implementation of an after-school mathematics program) taken with a specific goal. 2. To design a hypothesis, we subtly link the action with the anticipated outcome (improvement in students' math abilities and understanding) in the form of an IF-THEN statement. 3. The hypothesis is based on the assumption that additional practice with personalized attention can potentially enhance the students' understanding of mathematics, which is a general theory in educational fields. 4. To verify or reject this hypothesis, one would ideally collect and analyze the relevant data, such as comparing students' grades or math skills before and after participating in this program. 5.

His teacher alerts astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car accident before he can alert the world. One year later, MSNBC journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of Secretary of the Treasury Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to \\"Ellie\\", supposedly a mistress. After interviewing Rittenhouse, she is intercepted by the FBI and brought before President Tom Beck. Lerner realizes that Ellie is not a mistress but an acronym: \\"E.L.E.\\", for \\"Extinction-Level Event\\". Due to Lerner's investigation, President Beck makes an announcement earlier than planned: the comet named Wolf-Biederman (named after Wolf and Biederman, mistakenly assuming Leo Biederman was killed along with Professor Wolf) is headed for Earth. It is 7 miles (11Â km) long, large enough to cause a mass extinction, and possibly wipe out humanity, if it hits the Earth. He also reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing an Orion spacecraft called Messiah in orbit in order to transport a team led by Oren Monash and including veteran astronaut Spurgeon Tanner to the comet, so that its path toward Earth may be diverted using nuclear weapons. After his name is mentioned on TV, Leo speaks to the town about the discovery and how the White House thought he died alongside Wolf. After landing on the comet, the crew members plant nuclear bombs beneath the surface, but are delayed and caught in out-gassing explosions when sunlight hits the comet surface. While fleeing to the space vehicle, Monash is blinded due to direct unfiltered sunlight and suffers severe facial burns, and Gus Partenza is lost, ejected from the surface by an outflow of gas. When the bombs detonate, the ship is damaged from the blast, and the team loses contact with Earth. President Beck... The answer to this question is:","response":"A megatsunami in the Atlantic Ocean can be created by a massive underwater landslide, volcanic eruption, or an asteroid or comet impact, like the one presented in the movie \\"Deep Impact\\". In the movie's plot, a 7-mile-long comet named Wolf-Biederman is on a collision course with Earth. If the comet were to hit the Atlantic Ocean, it could potentially create a megatsunami due to the massive amount of energy released from the impact."},{"question":"Question: when was steven tyler born I found the following answer on Google: In the 1970s, Tyler rose to prominence as the frontman of Aerosmith, which released such milestone hard rock albums as Toys in the Attic and Rocks .

Sauce Hollandaise is one of the five fundamental \\"mother\\" sauces in French cuisine as defined by Auguste Escoffier in his classic culinary guide, \\"Le Guide Culinaire\\". These mother sauces are the base for many various sauces used in French cookery. Sauce Hollandaise is an emulsion of egg yolks, melted butter, and lemon juice or vinegar, typically seasoned with salt and a dash of cayenne pepper. It is a rich and creamy sauce with a pale yellow color and is often served over eggs Benedict, fish dishes, and steamed vegetables like asparagus. 1. Sauce Mousseline: Also known as Sauce Chantilly, this sauce is a variation of Sauce Hollandaise, with one additional ingredient – whipped cream. To make Sauce Mousseline, prepare a classic Hollandaise sauce and gently fold in whipped cream at the end. The resulting sauce is lighter, airier, and has a delicate texture compared to the original. It is typically served with fish, seafood, and even some poultry dishes or vegetables like asparagus and artichokes. 2. Sauce Dijon: As the name suggests, this sauce is made by adding Dijon mustard to the base Hollandaise sauce. In a traditional recipe, Sauce Dijon contains about 2-3 tablespoons of Dijon mustard per cup of Hollandaise sauce. The Dijon mustard adds a tangy and slightly spicy flavor, making it an excellent accompaniment for fish, like grilled or poached salmon, as well as for vegetables and certain meat dishes. 3. Sauce Foyot: Also known as Sauce Valois or Sauce Béarnaise au Beurre, this sauce is a combination of Sauce Hollandaise and Sauce Béarnaise, which itself is a derivative of hollandaise. To make Sauce Foyot, add a generous amount of reduced meat glaze (called \\"glaçage\\" in French) or veal demi-glace to a classic Sauce Béarnaise. The meat glaze gives this sauce a slightly more intense flavor and a richer texture, making it suitable for more robust dishes, like grilled or roasted meats, particularly steak and lamb. So, in summary, Sauce Mousseline, Sauce Dijon, and Sauce Foyot are all derivatives of the mother sauce, Sauce Hollandaise. Each of these sauces has its own unique taste and texture, making them versatile additions to a range of dishes in French cuisine."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - Armchair Theatre is a British television drama anthology series of single plays that ran on the ITV network from 1956 to 1974.

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. In August, 1950, McDaniel suffered a heart ailment and entered Temple Hospital in semi-critical condition. She was released in October to recuperate at home, and she was cited by United Press on Jan. 3, 1951, as showing \\"slight improvement in her recovery from a mild stroke.\\" McDaniel died of breast cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the hospital on the grounds of the Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, \\"I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery\\"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today. In 1999, Tyler Cassidy, the new owner of the Hollywood Cemetery (renamed the Hollywood Forever Cemetery), offered to have McDaniel re-interred there. Her family did not wish to disturb her remains and declined the offer. Instead, Hollywood Forever Cemetery built a large cenotaph on the lawn overlooking its lake. It is one of Hollywood's most popular tourist attractions. McDaniel's last will and testament of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than 10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than 11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was she sick prior to being diagnosed with cancer?","response":"Yes, Hattie McDaniel was sick before being diagnosed with cancer. In August 1950, she suffered a heart ailment and entered the hospital in a semi-critical condition. Later, in January 1951, she showed a slight improvement in her recovery from a mild stroke."},{"question":"farmhouses in tuscany with typical products Make this proper case.","response":"To make this phrase proper case, I will capitalize the first letter of each noun and any other necessary words.

Prince Harry proved just how serious he is about Suits actress Meghan Markle after making a top-secret visit to her home in Toronto, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal. With just one protection officer in tow, the 32-year-old royal kept a low profile as he caught a commercial flight to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport on October 28 for a romantic trip to the Canadian city. “He was buzzing with excitement when he arrived,” a Harry pal tells the new issue of Us Weekly, adding that a “car was waiting at the airport so he could be driven to Meghan’s house.” For the next several days, including Halloween night, the couple holed up inside 35-year-old Markle’s suburban pad, forgoing nights out at her favorite city spots in favor of cooking together at home and playing with her rescue dogs, Lab-shepherd mix Bogart and beagle Guy. Adds the pal, “It’s very serious.” For the couple — who met through a mutual friend in June — the visit has been one of many transatlantic travels in their relationship. Markle quietly went on dates with Harry on trips to London in July, September and October, often sharing cryptic snaps of her British travels on Instagram. “She’s met his closest circle of friends, and they all love her,” a source adds of the U.N. Women advocate, who has spent time with a number of his nearest and dearest, including a double date with Harry’s cousin Princess Eugenie and her love Jack Brooksbank. “It’s an exciting time.” And while it’s too early for engagement talk, the source adds that Markle is perfect for the philanthropic prince: “Harry’s in a really good place.

As is the way with these things, Ms Markle - best known for her role in the legal drama, Suits - combines her acting career with being a UN advocate and style blogger, boasting a million followers on Instagram, where she describes herself as a “lover of handwritten notes”. Breathless reports declare that the two have been an item for six months, share a love of yoga, and sport matching friendship bracelets. The 32-year-old prince is described as “besotted”. One detail that no one seems unduly concerned about is that Markle is a divorcee, following a marriage to a film producer that ended in 2014. “And why should they be?” those of a more nipperish persuasion may demand. Yet to anyone hoary enough to remember the sacrifice made in the Fifties by Princess Margaret, the nonchalance about such matters will represent a significant sea change. ||||| Prince Harry is so serious with actress Meghan Markle that an engagement could be in the not-so-distant future, insiders suggest.

Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that there are two women in a martial arts match, and one woman is pinning the other by sitting on her head. The premise provides us information about the situation, which is a martial arts competition involving two women. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that the two women are fighting over the same man in a duel to the death. The hypothesis introduces the motive behind their fight (fighting over a man) and the intensity of the fight (a duel to the death). Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis Now, we'll compare the information provided in the premise with the hypothesis. The premise mentions that the women are in a martial arts match, which means they are engaged in a regulated sport or competition. Step 4: Identify discrepancies The hypothesis, on the other hand, introduces the idea of fighting over a man and participating in a duel to the death. This information is not present in the premise provided. The premise only talks about the martial arts match and the technique used by one woman to pin down the other, without mentioning any motive or the intensity of the fight. Step 5: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the women fighting over a man or participating in a duel to the death.

When the pope himself was asked last year about it, he replied, \\"I believe that this is the season of mercy.\\" A complete report is due next week, and while the Times notes that it's unlikely to toss doctrine on its head, this change in tone will reverberate in parishes globally. Expand this summary.","response":"The Vatican, under the leadership of Pope Francis, seems to be moving towards a more inclusive stance regarding gay and divorced Catholics, encouraging priests to make \\"courageous pastoral choices\\" that embrace diverse family models. This apparent shift in attitude is part of a preliminary report emerging from a two-week synod that focuses on familial issues. Bishops attending the synod have suggested that the Church should recognize the \\"positive aspects of civil unions and cohabitation\\" and welcome individuals who participate in the Church's life in an \\"incomplete and imperfect way\\", acknowledging the values they bring rather than focusing on their limitations. While the report is still a work in progress, it reflects a growing change in tone and approach within the Catholic Church, primarily driven by Pope Francis himself. Earlier this year, the pope initiated a heated debate about the Church's treatment of divorced Catholics, and he asked a moderate cardinal to address his fellow clergy members on the issue. German Cardinal Walter Kasper remarked that many people argue that the current stance of the Church doesn't align with the teachings of Jesus, who was known for his mercy and forgiveness. Pope Francis' vision of a more merciful and inclusive Church was evident when he was asked about the issue of divorced Catholics last year; he responded by saying, \\"I believe that this is the season of mercy.\\" Although the final report expected next week is unlikely to result in a dramatic change in doctrine, the change in tone and approach will have far-reaching effects on Catholic parishes worldwide. Under Pope Francis' guidance, the Catholic Church appears to be gradually moving away from strict and exclusive interpretations of its teachings, promoting a more open and compassionate attitude toward those it formerly shunned, such as gay and divorced Catholics. This development is significant, as it reflects an institution willing to adapt to the evolving needs of its members and maintain its relevance in modern society. In embracing diverse family models and recognizing the positive aspects that civil unions and cohabitation can bring, the Church seems to be taking a step towards a more compassionate and understanding environment that may encourage more people to engage with it. While the final report is still to be released, the shift in emphasis from judgment and exclusion to mercy and inclusion is undeniably significant. This change in perspective within the Catholic Church has the potential to impact the lives of many people, both within and beyond its congregation. It could help to break down barriers and prejudices that have long existed around topics such as homosexuality and divorce, encouraging a more inclusive and understanding society. In conclusion, the Vatican's move towards a more inclusive approach regarding gay and divorced Catholics, driven by Pope Francis, highlights a changing attitude that may eventually lead to a more compassionate and understanding Catholic Church. While final decisions have not yet been made, the synod's preliminary report indicates a willingness to adapt, promoting mercy and inclusion over strict adherence to traditional doctrines. This change in tone will likely have wide-reaching implications for Catholic parishes across the globe, fostering a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Alex got up early in the morning and left for school.

Movie title: Apollo 18 Movie plot: In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet.

Sulphur is an essential element used in a variety of industries and applications, and its refined forms are suited for specific purposes. Let's discuss the different types of sulphur and their uses in more detail. 1. Crude or unrefined sulphur: This is the natural state of sulphur, usually found near volcanic regions or as a byproduct of petroleum and natural gas processing. Crude sulphur has impurities and is yellowish in color. It is primarily used as a raw material for producing various sulphur-based products such as sulphuric acid, which is an essential component in numerous industries like fertilizers, chemicals, and metallurgical processes. 2. Sublimed sulphur: Also known as flowers of sulphur, sublimed sulphur is obtained through the process of sublimation, wherein sulphur is heated to change directly from a solid state to a gas. The sulphur vapor then condenses on a cold surface, resulting in a fine, bright yellow powder. This purified form of sulphur is used in the pharmaceutical industry, mainly for topical ointments and skin treatments due to its antifungal properties. It is also commonly used in the production of sulphur compounds and rubber vulcanization. 3. Precipitated sulphur: Precipitated sulphur is formed by dissolving crude sulphur in an aqueous solution of ammonia or other solvents, followed by acidification, which results in the precipitation of fine sulphur particles. This finely divided form of sulphur is used in various applications, primarily as an ingredient in the manufacture of anti-flatulent preparations, some types of pesticides, and rubber chemicals. It is also found in hair care products and dermatological ointments, as it possesses beneficial properties for the skin and hair, such as promoting healthy hair growth and combating eczema. 4. Colloidal sulphur: Colloidal sulphur is a suspension of extremely fine sulphur particles within a liquid medium, typically water or oil. Due to the minute size of these particles, they remain suspended and evenly distributed, preventing them from settling. This form of sulphur is mostly employed in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as an active ingredient in topical skin treatments for acne and other skin disorders. Additionally, it is used as a stabilizing agent in the manufacture of emulsions and suspensions. In summary, crude or unrefined sulphur is the raw form of the element, which is then processed and purified into various forms, such as sublimed sulphur, precipitated sulphur, and colloidal sulphur, depending on the application and desired properties. These refined forms of sulphur are widely used across numerous industries, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, agriculture, and manufacturing."},{"question":"Please briefly summarize this news article: The Self-Examined Life This economic downturn has been tough on everyone, but for those of us in the creative community it’s been especially hard. I’m no complainer (not that I get any credit for it), but I’ve got to tell my story — not so much for myself as for my fellow artists everywhere. Things might be different if I were a painter, or a sculptor, but I’m not. I’m an omphaloskeptic. And the sad truth is, I can no longer make a living gazing at my own navel. Even before I knew what enlightenment was, I sensed my navel was its fleshy portal. I’ve been gazing at it since I can remember, and if I concentrate hard enough, I can even conjure up a gauzy, half-formed memory of the doctor cutting my umbilical cord (although it may be one of my frat brothers loosening my pants after I passed out at a rush-week kegger). My navel practically begs for contemplation: the inward curve of the skin, so like the inward-turning journey of self-awareness; the smooth pinkness, as ethereal and unblemished as a pure human soul; the perfect roundness, so emblematic of the perfection each of us strives for, except when I sit and it assumes more of an oval, football-type shape. Or so it did when I was younger and a little thinner. Today it’s more like that slot on a vending machine that takes bills. Staring at my navel lets me hear the quiet inner voice that’s too often drowned out by other daily activities, like staring at my face or biceps. It’s the voice that says, “All are connected. The universe is one. Is that a tick bite?” You can see what I’m getting at: to know one’s navel is to know oneself. And I’m talking about the whole self, even the parts that don’t paint a flattering self-portrait. Yes, I have navel lint, and I don’t deny its existence — any more than I deny my irrational fear of water, or the occasional fits of paranoia that make me believe the two are somehow connected. Please understand: my devotion to my navel is not due to the fact that it’s a particularly attractive one. That’s just a happy coincidence. Looks don’t matter to me; I certainly don’t believe my navel is better than anyone else’s, and, as I often observe in my hourly Tweets about my navel, I’m not doing this because I’m a narcissist. I won’t pretend that I know how my life would have been different had I been born with an outie. But I like to think that even with a navel that misshapen and hideous, I’d have found the strength to gaze. Which is why it’s all the more galling that I can no longer support myself doing it. In the past, I’ve eked out a modest artist’s living by incorporating my navel observations into monologues I’d perform downtown and essays I’d publish in art journals. But the converted subway token factory where I held my shows has been converted again, into a sanitarium for former real estate agents; and the art journals have all ceased publication, or been repurposed into condescending coffee cup sleeves. And so I find myself doing what I’d sworn I never would: joining the rat race. I’ve been forced to hire myself out to gaze at the navels of those who have managed to weather the financial storm: C.E.O.’s, C.F.O.’s, C.O.O.’s, and one guy whose cat plays the piano on YouTube. The conditions under which I gaze at these executives’ navels are appalling. Contemplative silence? Forget it. I’m lucky if they take a breath between calling subordinates into their offices to fire them and phoning Bangalore to hire new ones. Privacy? Don‘t make me laugh. Last month I had to gaze at a C.E.O.’s navel while he sat in a hot tub, bonding with his vice presidents at the company’s annual retreat. I’ve still got water in my ears. The worst humiliation of all, of course, comes when I’m done gazing at a C.E.O.’s navel and, before I’ve even reached the door, I hear him pick up his phone and start to dial. I know damn well what he’s doing. He’s calling in someone else to second-gaze me. But as I said, I’m no complainer. I’ve spoken out only because I believe my struggle, like my navel, offers a greater lesson to others suffering through this recession. This economic slide will end, as all do. And one day I will again have the time, and the means, to gaze at no other navel but my own. Until then, the silencing of the voices borne of the contemplations arising from my reflections upon my navel — the abrupt echoing emptiness of that shallow chamber of insights so swiftly turned cold by subsidization’s setting sun — is a loss whose vastness knows no bounds … not only to mine own sense of selfhood, but to society’s. Hey. That last line was kind of elegant. Maybe I should do poetry, too. Glenn Eichler is a writer for “The Colbert Report” on Comedy Central.

Article: FRIDAY, Aug. 3 (Health Day News) -- Middle school students who are physically fit are likely to score higher on standardized tests measuring reading and math abilities, a new study has found. And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. \\"The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,\\" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. \\"Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive and academic benefits that come from physical fitness\\", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading...

He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic towards his own acting, once remarking that \\"pictures stink\\". Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights, singing \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" with Tommy Dorsey's The Pied Pipers. In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief appearance singing \\"Night and Day\\". The following year he was given his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures. In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \\"Ol' Man River. In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression.

This task is in Spanish. Based on the given context, generate a question which can be answered by the given context. Generate a question that has more than 7 words. You can paraphrase the given context while forming the question. Suggestion: The question may involve starting question words like WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHAT (in Spanish). CONTEXT: Estilos artísticos Cada periodo histórico ha tenido unas características concretas y definibles, comunes a otras regiones y culturas, o bien únicas y diferenciadas, que han ido evolucionando con el devenir de los tiempos. De ahí surgen los estilos artísticos, que pueden tener un origen geográfico o temporal, o incluso reducirse a la obra de un artista en concreto, siempre y cuando se produzcan unas formas artísticas claramente definitorias. ‘Estilo’ proviene del latín stilus (‘punzón’), escrito en época medieval como stylus por influencia del término griego στύλος (stylos, ‘columna’). Antiguamente, se denominaba así a un tipo de punzón para escribir sobre tablillas de cera; con el tiempo, pasó a designar tanto el instrumento, como el trabajo del escritor y su manera de escribir. El concepto de estilo surgió en literatura, pero pronto se extendió al resto de artes, especialmente música y danza. Actualmente se emplea este término en su sentido metonímico, es decir, como aquella cualidad que identifica la forma de trabajar, de expresarse o de concebir una obra de arte por parte del artista, o bien, en sentido más genérico, de un conjunto de artistas u obras que tienen diversos puntos en común, agrupados geográfica o cronológicamente. Así, el estilo puede ser tanto un conjunto de caracteres formales, bien individuales –la forma de escribir, de componer o de elaborar una obra de arte por parte de un artista–, o bien colectivos –de un grupo, una época o un lugar geográfico–, como un sistema orgánico de formas, en que sería la conjunción de determinados factores la que generaría la forma de trabajar del grupo, como en el arte románico, gótico, barroco, etc. Según Focillon, un estilo es «un conjunto coherente de formas unidas por una conveniencia recíproca, sumisas a una lógica interna que las organiza». ANSWER: un tipo de punzón para escribir sobre tablillas de cera Output:","response":"¿Cuál es el origen del término 'estilo', cómo se usaba antiguamente y qué tipo de herramienta se empleaba para escribir sobre tablillas de cera en ese tiempo?"},{"question":"M-1600LaserCutterMachineforfoils Please segment the words:","response":"To segment the given string \\"M-1600LaserCutterMachineforfoils\\", I will identify possible word boundaries and separate the words accordingly. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of my approach: 1. First, I will look for any apparent separators, such as spaces or special characters. In this case, there is a \\"-\\" between \\"M\\" and \\"1600\\". So, the first segmentation is: \\"M - 1600LaserCutterMachineforfoils\\" 2. Next, I will identify the numeric part, \\"1600\\", which is most likely separate from the surrounding text. So, the segmentation becomes: \\"M - 1600 LaserCutterMachineforfoils\\" 3. Now, I will look for capital letters that can indicate the beginning of a new word. In this case, I see \\"Laser\\", \\"Cutter\\", and \\"Machine\\". The segmentation will look like this: \\"M - 1600 Laser Cutter Machineforfoils\\" 4. Continuing to identify capital letters for new words, I find the word \\"for\\". The segmentation now becomes: \\"M - 1600 Laser Cutter Machine forfoils\\" 5. Finally, I'll separate the last two words \\"for\\" and \\"foils\\" to get the final segmentation: \\"M - 1600 Laser Cutter Machine for foils\\" So, the given string segmented into words is: \\"M - 1600 Laser Cutter Machine for foils\\""},{"question":"Claim: \\"Constantine the Great converted the Roman Empire to Christianity.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search? Options: - yes - no Your chain-of-thought:","response":"The claim \\"Constantine the Great converted the Roman Empire to Christianity\\" is partially correct, but it needs some clarification. Chain-of-thought: - Constantine the Great was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 306 AD to 337 AD. - He played a significant role in the spread of Christianity within the Roman Empire. - In 313 AD, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which granted religious tolerance and freedom to all religions, including Christianity. This allowed Christians to practice their faith openly without fear of persecution. - Constantine himself converted to Christianity and was the first Roman Emperor to do so. However, his conversion did not immediately convert the entire Roman Empire to Christianity. - Constantine's support of Christianity did help the religion gain popularity and influence, which eventually led to it becoming the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. - However, this process took time and occurred over several generations, not solely due to Constantine's actions. In conclusion, while Constantine the Great played an important role in supporting Christianity and fostering its growth in the Roman Empire, he did not single-handedly convert the entire Roman Empire to Christianity. Therefore, the claim is partially correct but needs further explanation."},{"question":"Given the below context: After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

Apart from one match in 1945, his first-class career spanned the period between the two world wars. His first-class debut was delayed by the First World War until 1919 and his career was effectively terminated in August 1939 when he was called up for military service in the imminent Second World War. He was the first cricketer to score 16 centuries in Test match cricket. Context: Sutcliffe and Len Hutton opened the Yorkshire innings in one championship match in 1934 and then, with Sutcliffe's Test career ending the following year, became the regular Yorkshire pairing until 1939 when the outbreak of war effectively ended Sutcliffe's career. Especially given that he was from Pudsey, Hutton was often portrayed as Sutcliffe's protege but Hutton maintained that it was the coaching of George Hirst that did most to develop his career. He said of Sutcliffe: \\"You do learn a lot from watching a player of Herbert's class. It was an enriching and invaluable experience to bat with him\\". Sutcliffe's view of Hutton was that he was \\"a marvel - the discovery of a generation\\". Hutton said that his shyness and the fact that he was twenty years younger than Sutcliffe made it difficult for him to approach his partner when he needed help, which he more readily got from Bill Bowes and Hedley Verity. About Sutcliffe he said: \\"I did not find it easy to talk to him\\". The master-apprentice relationship changed after Hutton scored a world record 364 for England against Australia at The Oval in 1938. Future Yorkshire captain Ronnie Burnet reckoned that Sutcliffe had been the dominant partner until then and their scores would be something like 60 to 40 in Sutcliffe's favour. After Hutton made his record, his confidence increased and Burnet said the ratio was reversed \\"to 70:30 in Len's favour\\". Burnet said that Hutton was \\"tearing attacks apart in 1939 and Herbert was by then playing second fiddle\\". Comparisons of the two Pudsey masters have been inevitable but there were essential differences in style. Bill Bowes said that Sutcliffe readily acknowledged the superior ability of Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond and Len Hutton but what Sutcliffe did have were the concentration and willpower to make the best of his abilities in any given situation. Hutton pinpointed the key difference by explaining that, when Sutcliffe was taking guard, \\"his weight was on the (front) left foot, enabling him to play the hook shot so well\\" whereas Hutton put his weight onto his (back) right foot. Hence Sutcliffe more easily moved back while Hutton developed a forward style. Another view, expressed by Sutcliffe's son Billy, who also played with Hutton for Yorkshire, was that Sutcliffe was \\"probably better in a crisis\\", as his numerous successes on bad or \\"sticky\\" wickets would suggest. Sutcliffe and Hutton made 16 century opening partnerships together, 15 of them for Yorkshire. Their highest was 315, which they achieved twice. Question: Did he bowl as well. Whats the answer?","response":"The given text does not provide any information about Herbert Sutcliffe's bowling capability or history. It primarily focuses on his accomplishments as an opening batsman. Hence, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine if he also bowled."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: Adell Hartwell says that at one time there were thirteen teenagers crammed in, all running fevers, and all still smoking (cancer being the result of engrams or body thetans or whatever, supposedly granting Scientologists immunity).","response":"Адель Хартвелл говорит, что когда-то там было сжато тринадцать подростков, все они испытывали жар, и все продолжали курить (рак является результатом энграмм или теле-тетанов или что-то вроде того, предположительно, предоставляя иммунитет участникам Саентологии).

In a domestic violence case (in which I was the accused, but by God I was innocent) with my ex girlfriend, the lawyer whom I hired and paid his dues, openly played a wheeling and dealing game for two and a half years with the prosecutor and had mercilessly thrown me in front of the prosecutor. My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles’ child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family. Although I mentioned this to my “so called” lawyer, he refused to mention her unstable psychological condition in the court. I believe by doing so, he also committed a crime by preventing a child sexual abuse case go unveiled. After all these and after having me pushed into loosing my otherwise strong case, I was sentenced with restriction order to my own home, loosing all I had paid for it, loosing my stuff inside home, aforced probation and a forced domestic violence course for no good reason, my so called bloody lawyer also sent to the court a paper indicating that I owed to him and never had paid his dues. Disgusting wheeling and dealing quite often happen between such disgusting lawyers and greedy, heartless prosecutors; unfortunately! My psychologist friend at the time said, “If you are in Illinois, in Champaign County and you have a penis, you are already accepted as guilty by birth to start with dude”. They say “Sharks wouldn't attack and eat Lawyers after a ship sunk”. Why? It's professional courtesy! Question: what is probably true about the man? === The answer to the above question is A:","response":"The man is likely a victim of inefficient legal representation and a biased legal system. His \\"so-called\\" lawyer did not take his client's side or interests seriously and failed to bring up the important factor of his ex-girlfriend's psychological instability and history of abuse. This led to unfair sentencing, including a restraining order, loss of property, probation, and mandatory participation in a domestic violence course. Furthermore, the lawyer falsely claimed that he was not paid, worsening the situation. The man also feels that there is a general prejudice against men in the legal system of his jurisdiction, as his psychologist friend suggested that being male is equated to guilt in Champaign County, Illinois."},{"question":"Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what makes the pupils sensitive?\\" is \\"nerves\\", given that dilation makes the pupils sensitive? OPTIONS: (I) Yes; (II) No; The answer is:","response":"The answer is: No. The question, \\"What makes the pupils sensitive?\\" requires a more detailed explanation rather than simply answering with \\"nerves.\\" It is important to understand the key components involved in the process of pupil sensitivity, such as the role of light, muscles, and the nervous system. Pupil sensitivity is primarily controlled by the amount of light entering the eyes and the ability of the iris (the colored part of the eye) to constrict or dilate the pupil in response to changes in light conditions. The process is called pupillary response or pupillary reflex, and it enables the eyes to adjust to different light levels to protect the retina and ensure optimal vision. The pupil is a small aperture in the center of the iris, which can change in size depending on the lighting conditions. Bright light causes the pupil to constrict (become smaller), limiting the amount of light entering the eye, whereas dim light causes the pupil to dilate (become larger), allowing more light to enter the eye. The whole process of pupillary response is controlled by a combination of nerves, muscles, and the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system has two main components: the sympathetic division (responsible for activating the \\"fight or flight\\" response) and the parasympathetic division (responsible for \\"rest and digest\\" activities). During the pupillary response, the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions work together to constrict or dilate the pupil. The parasympathetic division works via the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) to stimulate the circular muscle fibers of the iris, causing the pupil to constrict. In contrast, the sympathetic division stimulates the radial muscle fibers of the iris, leading to pupil dilation. In conclusion, while mentioning \\"nerves\\" is partially correct, it does not fully explore the depth and complexity of the factors that make pupils sensitive. A more comprehensive answer would consider how the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions, the muscles of the iris, and environmental light conditions all contribute to pupil sensitivity."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question? 400*(90/100)* (95/100) = 342 A: (C)","response":"The question could be: \\"If an item costs 400 and there is a 10% discount followed by an additional 5% discount, what would be the final price?\\" Here's my step-by-step reasoning: Step 1: Apply the 10% discount on the original price - 10% of 400 = (10/100) * 400 = 40 - Subtract the discount: 400 - 40 = 360 Step 2: Apply the additional 5% discount on the discounted price - 5% of 360 = (5/100) * 360 = 18 - Subtract the discount: 360 - 18 = 342 So the final price would be 342, which matches the provided answer (C)."},{"question":"Translate to Czech: Yeah.

On their first UK tour four years ago, drummer Ben Thatcher dislocated his finger in the middle of a show. \\"He just got some gaffer tape and gaffered his two fingers together and played the rest of the set,\\" Kerr says, matter-of-factly. Later, on a US tour, their sound technician \\"lost a testicle\\", requiring emergency surgery. The details of that trauma are not up for discussion. Hopefully, then, the band will remain injury-free in the run-up to Glastonbury, where they're third on Friday's main stage bill, just behind Radiohead and The xx. \\"Glastonbury is such a big deal,\\" marvels Thatcher. \\"The Pyramid Stage is the biggest stage in the world.\\" The set will rely heavily on their second album, How Did We Get So Dark?, released this Friday. It's a record that takes their rampaging rock riffs and pushes them in unexpected directions. Lead single Lights Out contains bursts of 1970s T-Rex backing vocals, while the piano-led Hole In Your Heart reflects the band's love of R&B. The BBC sat down with the duo to talk about the perks of fame; the perils of touring; and why they have \\"a delicate sound\\". Here are six of their best stories. Recording How Did We Get So Dark? gave the band the opportunity to experiment with new sounds and techniques. It did not go well. \\"One thing we learned is we have quite a delicate sound and once you add things - the wrong things - our whole sound sort of shrivels,\\" says Mike. \\"Or it capsizes and it doesn't sound like us any more. We've realised a lot of the identity of our music is when me and Ben play together.\\" \\"Even the backing vocals - we did try having girls come in and sing, but it just didn't work. It had to be my voice. It had to be just about me and Ben.\\" Royal Blood are a compact unit. Ben plays drums. Mike plays bass and sings. For some reason, though, this set-up has mystified journalists everywhere. \\"'Why are you just a two-piece band?'\\" Mike sighs. \\"We get asked that all the time. I guarantee Kings Of Leon have never been asked why they're a quartet.\\" \\"Our whole two-piece thing really was not thought about at all,\\" he explains. \\"Once I plugged in [the bass] and showed Ben the sound, it was like, 'Cool, let's write the songs'. \\"I wasn't thinking, 'what if it wasn't just the two of us?'\\" \\"Making a record and writing for that long, you kind of forget what you're doing. And the whole premise of our band is that we're a live band. That's Royal Blood in its purest form.\\" As they toured the world, Royal Blood picked up a few celebrity hangers-on. After a show in San Franciso, Metallica's Lars Ulrich knocked on their dressing room door, bundled them into the back of a car and gave them a tour of his hometown. When Ben turned 27, Led Zeppelin star Jimmy Page turned up to his birthday party and ate an apple crumble. Best of all, the drummer was invited to play Tommy Lee's giant \\"drum rollercoaster,\\" which travelled, upside down above the audience's heads on Motley Crue's 2015 farewell tour. \\"It's insane. He's insane,\\" laughs Ben. \\"I went down to Wembley Arena, they strapped me in and then, when it started going up, I just thought, 'What am I doing?' \\"I hadn't thought about it properly. I was like, 'This is going to be so much fun' and then it was terrifying.\\" Still, he managed to compose himself and thrash out a few solos. \\"It's a different kind of playing. When you're upside down you're fighting the gravity. But it's a roller-coaster. The adrenalin lets you do things that you can't normally do.\\" Back in 2015, Mike told Q Magazine he'd written \\"about 50\\" new songs for Royal Blood's second album.

He does this without playing to a click-track, locked to the tempo of the recorded elements, to stop him drifting out of time. \\"There's one sample that's 16 bars long,\\" says Mike, looking worried by the mere thought of it. \\"It's a long, slow pitch bend that if you play the song too fast, you miss it. \\"But Ben's a wizard, so that helps.\\" \\"We've stopped playing some of the songs from the first album,\\" says Mike. \\"There's a few that we've grown out of. There might be the odd lyric that I wouldn't say any more.

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home. For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains. From the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries. \\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement. It was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize. \\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \\"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\\" It was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague. The United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: President Trump probably believes that: Options: - Are experiencing their biggest moment on the world stage - Good days are ahead for North Korea - not enough information - North Korea is tired of military exercises Answer:","response":"Good days are ahead for North Korea."},{"question":"Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. Do you have any questions?","response":"Oh, that's a big story! Let me try to explain it in a simpler way, like a story for a five-year-old. A long, long time ago, there was a beautiful group of islands called Madeira. Some people thought these islands were part of a magical lost land. But the true story begins in 1418 when some brave sailors from Portugal, led by a man named João Gonçalves Zarco, found the islands. Zarco and his friends saw an amazing big island with lots of trees, so they called it \\"Island of Timber.\\" That's another name for Madeira. They also found another island with a beautiful beach and called it Porto Santo, which means \\"Holy Port.\\" The Portuguese king was very happy about this discovery, and he wanted to make sure people lived on these islands. So, Zarco and his friends helped people start new lives there. They became the leaders of the islands and made sure everything was going well. And that's how these beautiful islands became a home for many people."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The first week your dog is in your home, try feeding it from your hands. This will encourage the dog to trust you. Let your dog watch you fill their food and water bowls. They will associate you with food and understand that you are providing for them. Feed your dog at specific times during the day rather than leaving food out all day. This is a good way to help your dog build a routine and to further associate you with food and caring for them. There are many different types of dog food. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation if you are unsure of what to choose. Some dogs are pickier than others and prefer certain types of dog food over others. It may take a few tries to find a food that your dog likes. Treats are a great way to motivate your dog to do tricks or to reward them for good behavior. Give treats in moderation to keep your dog at a healthy weight. A healthy dog is a happy dog! Good preventive medical care helps them live a longer happier life. Make sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations and worming. If your dog does have medical problems, their medical care can become very expensive. Pet medical insurance is one option to help moderate your costs. When you have a strong bond with your dog, your dog will begin to understand that you are concerned about their health and wellbeing when it comes to medical procedures or vet visits. Your dog will need plenty of exercise to keep healthy and spending time together walking is a good way to bond with your pet. Again, they will associate you with going on walks, which many dogs find to be their favorite activity! Purchase a good quality leash. If you have a larger dog that is strong, you may want to consider buying a harness or a head halter to attach to a leash. Take your dog out regularly for good long walks. Train them to behave appropriately on a leash. They should not be pulling you along the road. They should heel and stay close by your side and walk at your pace. Take your dog to the dog park and let them socialize with other dogs and people. Your dog can bond and meet new friends while they enjoy being outside and running free. Always clean up after your dog and carry plastic bags on your walks to dispose of your dog’s waste. Try taking your dog to new and exciting places on your walks to keep it engaged. For example, you can go to a new park, garden, trail, or downtown street. Depending on the breed of your dog, they may require more frequent or complicated grooming. Generally, try to brush your dog’s fur at least once a week to prevent knotted, matted hair. Give them baths. Some dogs love baths, some are not such big fans. Wash them at least once a month, or whenever they are muddy or dirty.. If you use a gentle shampoo, you can bathe your dog up to once a week. Depending on the breed, you may need to take your dog to the groomers so they can give your dog hair cuts that are appropriate for the breed. Trim your dog’s nails. Like humans, dogs’ nails grow continuously. Unless your dog is very active and wears them down on pavement or concrete, you will need to trim their nails when they become long. There are special dog nail clippers, but regular nail clippers can be used as well.","response":"Feeding and caring for your dog is crucial to maintaining its health and strengthening your bond. During the first week at home, feed your dog by hand to establish trust. Consistently feed your dog at set times of the day to build routine and create a stronger association between you and their care. Consult your veterinarian for dog food recommendations and remember that it might take a few tries to find the best option for your furry friend. Treats can be an effective motivational tool but should be given sparingly to maintain a healthy weight. Prioritize preventive medical care, such as vaccinations and deworming, and consider pet medical insurance for any unexpected expenses. Regular exercise, like long walks and visits to the dog park, can keep your pet healthy and further strengthen your bond. Invest in a good quality leash and train your dog to walk properly without pulling. When it comes to grooming, brush your dog's fur weekly to prevent matting, and bathe them at least once a month. Consult a professional groomer for breed-specific haircuts, and remember to trim your dog's nails regularly. By providing proper care and nourishment, spending quality time together, and ensuring good health, your relationship with your dog will flourish, and you'll have a happy, healthy pet for years to come."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What album did the person who collaborated with Reid Paley contribute to in 2011?

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Question: When did Comey write his book? Options: A.

The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

Police Chief Kerr Putney stated that the video does not provide him with \\"absolute, definitive visual evidence that could confirm that a person is pointing a gun\\" and that he did not see that in the videos he watched. Scott, a 43-year-old father of seven, was shot after officers claimed he exited his vehicle with a gun and refused to drop it.

He plans to show the video to Scott's family but will not be making it public, arguing that the case does not warrant full transparency and doing so could harm the ongoing investigation. This decision has been met with opposition from the ACLU and others who demand answers and justice, such as US Rep. Alma Adams.

Pick your answer from: + no; + yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"As an AI assistant, I understand that you wish to inquire about Android and CyanogenMod. I will provide detailed and explanatory answers for both questions. Question 1: What is Android? Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, primarily designed for touchscreen mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables. Android was initially developed by Android Inc., which was acquired by Google in 2005. The Android operating system has seen numerous updates and improvements since its initial release, and it is currently the most widely used mobile operating system in the world. Android is open-source, allowing manufacturers and developers to customize the platform to suit their preferences and requirements. This flexibility has led to the development of various Android versions and countless Android devices, including phones, tablets, and televisions. Android also has a vast ecosystem of apps, with millions of applications available on the Google Play Store. Question 2: What is CyanogenMod? CyanogenMod was a popular open-source custom ROM based on the Android operating system. It was developed by a community of developers led by Cyanogen Inc. as an aftermarket firmware for various Android devices, aimed at providing additional features, improved performance, and enhanced customization options compared to the stock Android experience provided by the original device manufacturer. CyanogenMod offered various benefits, such as root access, regular software updates, and security patches, often surpassing the support provided by the official firmware. It was preferred by users who wanted more control over their devices, allowing them to remove and customize the default installations to suit their preferences. Unfortunately, Cyanogen Inc. discontinued the CyanogenMod project in December 2016. However, the work carried out by developers did not go in vain. A new custom ROM, LineageOS, was created as a continuation of CyanogenMod. LineageOS shares the same core values, objectives, and many developers from the original CyanogenMod project, ensuring that the spirit of aftermarket firmware development for Android devices persists. To address the final part of your question, whether Questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, the answer is 'no.' Android and CyanogenMod are not the same thing. Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, while CyanogenMod was a custom ROM based on the Android operating system, developed by a community of developers led by Cyanogen Inc."},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer. Rationale: It may be too early to be waiting for the beginning. The question and answer:","response":"Question: Is it possible that the concept of time affects our perception of when specific events should happen in our lives? Answer: Yes, the concept of time significantly influences our perception of when specific events should occur in our lives. Our understanding of time is mainly based on cultural, societal, and personal factors that shape our expectations. In the given rationale, \\"It may be too early to be waiting for the beginning,\\" it is evident that the notion of \\"too early\\" indicates a subjective assessment of time. People tend to associate particular milestones or achievements with specific age ranges or time frames.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Paragraph: Harry and Kim studied ancient humans.

Kim Il-sung was a prominent political figure and military leader who played a significant role in shaping the post-WWII political landscape of the Korean Peninsula. Kim Il-sung was born on April 15, 1912, in Mangyongdae, a small village near Pyongyang, which was then under Japanese colonial rule. He was exposed to anti-Japanese sentiment from a young age, partly because his family was involved in the Korean independence movement. Kim later joined the anti-Japanese resistance and became a member of the Chinese Communist Party in the early 1930s. After undergoing military training in the Soviet Union, Kim Il-sung became a prominent leader within the Korean resistance movement and was appointed the commanding officer of the 1st Division of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, he led several military operations against the Japanese forces occupying the Korean Peninsula. Following the defeat of Japan in World War II and the subsequent division of the Korean Peninsula between the Soviet Union and the United States, Kim Il-sung consolidated his power in the northern zone, establishing the North Korean Communist Party in 1946, later renamed the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). His leadership and charisma were essential in unifying various Marxist-Leninist factions within North Korea under the banner of the WPK. On September 9, 1948, Kim Il-sung officially proclaimed the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a socialist state based on Marxist-Leninist principles. He assumed the position of the Premier, the highest executive position in the government hierarchy. Under his rule, the economy was centralized, and collectivization of agriculture was implemented. A cult of personality was built around him, and propaganda campaigns emphasizing his role as the \\"Great Leader\\" were orchestrated. To unite the Korean Peninsula under a socialist government, Kim Il-sung initiated the Korean War in 1950 by invading South Korea. The war lasted until 1953 and ultimately ended in a stalemate with an armistice agreement, which established the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) as the border between the two Koreas. The war caused massive loss of lives and property on both sides of the peninsula and further deepened the political and ideological divide between the two nations. During the Cold War, Kim Il-sung's North Korea aligned with the Soviet Union and China, receiving substantial financial and military aid from both countries. The regime pursued a policy of self-reliance, known as \\"Juche,\\" and heavily invested in the development of heavy industries and defense capabilities. Throughout his tenure, Kim Il-sung maintained an iron grip on power, brutally suppressing any opposition or perceived threats to his rule. He passed away on July 8, 1994, leaving his son, Kim Jong-il, to inherit a nation that had already been economically and diplomatically isolated. In conclusion, Kim Il-sung was the leader responsible for the Marxist revolution in North Korea, leading the country from its foundation in 1948 until his death in 1994. He transformed the country into a socialist state, implementing Marxist-Leninist policies and maintaining power through an autocratic regime with a pervasive cult of personality. The legacy of Kim Il-sung's revolution continues to shape North Korea's political, economic, and social landscape to this day."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: In flowering plants, male gametophytes are in grains of what?

Given the context: How would Austin feel afterwards? The answer is:","response":"Austin would likely feel a combination of excitement, relief, and anticipation after asking Kendall for her stylist's information. Let's explore these emotions in more detail. 1. Excitement: Austin admires Kendall's hairstyle, which means he has found something he wants to try for himself. By obtaining her stylist's information, he now has the opportunity to achieve that desired look. This discovery may generate excitement because it can significantly enhance his self-image and style. It is possible that he struggled to find the right hairstyle for a while or was dissatisfied with his earlier experiences at hair salons, so finding Kendall's stylist might seem like a breakthrough. 2. Relief: Austin may have felt hesitant to ask Kendall for her stylist's information - he might have been worried that she would take offense to his request or be unwilling to share her stylist's details. After overcoming his hesitation and successfully obtaining the information, he might experience a sense of relief. This relief could stem from no longer having to feel concerned about his appearance or search for the perfect stylist. 3. Anticipation: Now that Austin has the stylist's information, he likely looks forward to scheduling an appointment to replicate Kendall's hairstyle. He may be curious about the stylist's technique, the products they use, and the overall experience at the salon. He may also feel eager to see the final result of his makeover, hoping that it will not only resemble Kendall's hairstyle but also suit him well and match his personal style.

At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment. I hope people in my home country can enjoy the same beautiful environment as I do,\\" says Chen, who has made New Zealand his home for the last 26 years. Options: A To have an exhibition. B To seek artistic freedom. C To visit his friends. D To earn money. Answer: B To seek artistic freedom. Question: The answer to this question is:","response":"Question: Why did Chen Xiao leave China for Australia in 1986? A) To have an exhibition. B) To seek artistic freedom. C) To visit his friends. D) To earn money. Answer: B) To seek artistic freedom."},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, (26 June 1824 - 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish mathematical physicist and engineer who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. William's father was able to make a generous provision for his favourite son's education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1845 Thomson graduated as Second Wrangler. He also won the First Smith's Prize, which, unlike the tripos, is a test of original research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner \\"You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.\\" While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and sculling, winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843. He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of mathematics, physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination. In 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of Faraday's idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or \\"dielectric\\", and not by some incomprehensible \\"action at a distance\\". He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the Faraday effect, which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related. He was elected a fellow of St. Peter's (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845. On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated Henri Victor Regnault, at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the University of Glasgow. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a learned professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student but a few years before. What did he do as a fellow?","response":"As a fellow, William Thomson spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated Henri Victor Regnault in Paris.

To create an example of a negative review, I first need to choose the subject of the review. In this case, let's assume I am writing a review for a recently opened restaurant. Step 2: Mention the problems and issues experienced. I will address the aspects of the restaurant experience that were unsatisfactory or below expectations such as food quality, service, ambience, and price. Step 3: Give specific details about the negative experiences. It is important to provide specific details to make the review credible, helpful, and informative. Step 4: Express disappointment or frustration. A negative review should convey the disappointment or frustration of the customer. This can help other potential customers understand the emotions experienced by the reviewer. Step 5: Provide suggestions for improvement (optional). In some cases, a reviewer might want to give some constructive feedback to help the business improve. This step is not mandatory, but can be useful for the business to know where they need to make changes. Example of a negative review based on the steps above: Title: Disappointing experience at \\"Taste Bistro\\" I was really excited to try Taste Bistro after hearing so much hype about their farm-to-table dishes, but unfortunately, my experience was considerably underwhelming. To start with, the food was nowhere near the quality I was expecting. I ordered the roasted chicken, and it was dry and lacked flavor. My friend's pasta dish was slightly better, but still nothing to rave about. The service was another letdown. Our server rarely checked in on us, and it took ages for them to bring our food. We had to repeatedly ask for water refills, and getting our check was a struggle. The ambience didn't help either, as the noise level was too high, making it difficult for my friend and me to have a conversation. Considering the price we paid, which was significantly higher than other similar restaurants in the area, I expected much better quality food and service. I'm disappointed that Taste Bistro didn't live up to the hype. I genuinely hope the management takes note of these issues and takes steps to improve the food quality, service, and overall dining experience, as the concept of farm-to-table can be outstanding when executed well. Overall, I cannot recommend Taste Bistro based on my experience there."},{"question":"Write a negative tweet.","response":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am committed to promoting safe, respectful, and positive communication.

Remote cameras in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest have captured several images of a black female in the same area as OR-7, who has been on the move since 2011 in search of new territory and a mate to form a new pack. The images were recovered Wednesday by John Stephenson, wolf biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as part of an ongoing wolf monitoring program by state and federal wildlife biologists. \\"This information is not definitive, but it is likely that this new wolf and OR-7 have paired up,\\" Stephenson said. He said transmissions from OR-7's radio collar also indicate the two have denned. \\"If that is correct, they would be rearing pups at this time of year,\\" Stephenson said. The two have never been in the same shot but they have passed the camera not long after each other, indicating they are aware of each other. Biologists determined that the black wolf was a female because she's smaller than OR-7 and squats to urinate. U.S. biologists and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife will wait until June or later to confirm whether there are pups. If the two have produced offspring, they would be the first wolves known to breed in the Oregon Cascades since the early 20th century. Evidence of another wolf in the Cascades surfaced in December, when biologists found tracks on the eastern slopes of Mount Hood. But there is no indication that those were the tracks of the black wolf, Stephenson said. The news of an OR-7 mate drew cheers from wildlife advocates. \\"For people who appreciate native wildlife in Oregon, the news doesn't get any bigger than this,\\" said Rob Klavins of Oregon Wild. The discovery comes as the OR-7 Expedition readies a 1,200-mile trek retracing as much as possible of OR-7's path. The group of people, including a wolf ecologist, wildlife educator and filmmaker, will spend 42 days traveling from the Eagle Cap Wilderness in Oregon to the Crater Lake area and finally to Mount Shasta in California. OR-7 is believed to be the first confirmed wolf in western Oregon since the last one was killed under a livestock protection bounty program in 1947. He is also the first confirmed wolf in California since 1924. He was born in spring 2009 in the shadow of the Eagle Cap Wilderness in northeastern Oregon as part of the Imnaha pack. In February 2011, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists collared him with a Global Positioning System device. OR-7 left the pack in September, 2011, days after the state issued a kill order for his father and sibling for preying on livestock. Most Oregon wolves that have taken off on similar journeys, called dispersals, have stayed in the northeastern sector of the state or ventured into Idaho. Lately, OR-7 has spent most of his time in the southwest Cascades, making occasional forays into California. The wolf's collar has eclipsed its normal life span though it is still sending signals. Biologists had said they would not replace it, but Michelle Dennehy, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the agency would now re-evaluate that. \\"We definitely want to keep at least one animal collared,\\" Stephenson said. \\"Now is not the time to do it. It's a sensitive time and OR-7s collar is still going strong.\\" Biologists will monitor OR-7 and the other wolf using remote cameras, collecting DNA from any scat discovered and by surveying the pups when appropriate. At the end of last year, there were 64 known wolves in Oregon. Except for OR-7, most are in the northeast. The animals are protected under the state and federal Endangered Species acts. -- Lynne Terry ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The hint states that about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones and that the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes. Also, most cave systems are formed in limestone bedrock. Step 2: Analyze the information given about White mountains. The passage states that White mountains have many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena.

Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

Answer this question please: Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? The answer is:","response":"Will learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As a specialist in montology (the study of mountains), Will's expertise primarily focuses on the formation, structure, and development of mountains. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, however, is an underwater oceanic feature primarily associated with the process of seafloor spreading and the formation of new oceanic crust.

Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","response":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down the given information and analyze it step by step. 1. The premise states that a hunter is holding a bird in one hand and his gun in the other. This implies that the bird is no longer flying, and the hunter has physical possession of the bird. 2. The hypothesis suggests that the hunter holds a grouse he has shot as he returns from a successful hunt. This statement contains specific information that is not present in the premise, such as the type of bird (a grouse), that the hunter has shot the bird, and that the hunting trip was successful overall. Given this analysis, we cannot conclusively say that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as there is not enough information within the premise to support the specific details in the hypothesis. The bird could be a different type or the bird could have been caught by hand or other means rather than shot.

I had one GP — let’s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS.

Along with Aramon, it was once considered one of the main grapes responsible for France's wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley. - A Bordeaux wine is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of France, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \\"claret\\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or \\"châteaux\\". There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine. - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 78 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive high-end wines sold internationally to more modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period. - Vitis (grapevines) is a genus of 79 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species predominantly from the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture. - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\". - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan , it can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour , but is mostly blended into bulk wines . The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine , and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine . Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines , it does carry their fruitful essence . The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California 's hot climate , specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys . Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural , special acidity . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Beqaa Valley (', ), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqâ and Becaa and known in Classical antiquity as Coele-Syria, is a fertile valley in eastern Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans). - The wine lake refers to the continuing supply surplus of wine produced in the European Union. A major contributor to that glut is the Languedoc-Roussillon, which produces over one-third of the grapes grown in France. In 2007 it was reported that for the previous several vintages, European countries had been producing 1.7 billion more bottles of wine than they sell. Hundreds of millions of bottles of wine are turned into industrial alcohol every year, a practice that is sometimes described as \\"emergency distillation\\". - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - \\"Jug wine\\" is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine (or \\"bulk wine\\") typically bottled in a glass jug. - Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name \\"Merlot\\" is thought to be a diminutive of \\"merle\\", the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and \\"fleshiness\\", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin. - Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is made into ice wine in those regions.

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only.

Turkey's Ahmet Davutoglu said the pair discussed \\"concrete steps\\" for Damascus to halt the killing of civilians. Mr Assad said he would not relent in pursuing \\"terrorist groups\\". As they met, rights activists said at least 28 more people had been killed, including nine in and around Hama. More than 1,700 civilians are believed to have been killed and tens of thousands arrested since the uprising began in mid-March. 'Open and clear' Mr Davutoglu, who has helped improve ties between Ankara and Damascus, had been told by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to pass on a \\"tough\\" message, demanding an end to the military operations against civilian demonstrators. Analysis This visit was probably Turkey's last chance to revive a relationship, which has been the foundation of its ambitious new foreign policy. Mr Davutoglu clearly had a lot to say. The talks lasted for three-and-a-half hours and the exchanges were probably pretty blunt. Mr Davutoglu described the methods used by the Syrian security forces as unacceptable, and said he outlined actions Syria must take to stop the bloodshed - the developments of the coming days will be critical, he said. But there is no indication that Mr Assad will act on Turkey's pleas. The warm, personal ties between him and the Turkish PM are now in the past. Other aspects of the relationship, like trade and tourism, which have flourished in recent years, are at risk. Tellingly, Turkey has co-ordinated closely with the US over its response to Syria; it may now be willing to back tougher action at the UN Security Council. Iran, another neighbour wooed by Turkey in recent years, is still backing President Assad. Mr Davutoglu used to describe his new foreign policy as one based on zero problems with Turkey's neighbours. He does not use that term any more. Over the weekend, Mr Erdogan said not only that he had \\"run out of patience\\", but also that from Turkey's point of view the Syrian crisis was almost an internal problem - their shared border is more than 800km (500 miles) long, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Istanbul. Many Turks sympathise with anti-government protesters in Syria and there is burning anger at what is happening, our correspondent says. Speaking to reporters on his return to Ankara, Mr Davutoglu described the methods used by the Syrian security forces as \\"unacceptable\\" and outlined actions that Syria had to take to stop the bloodshed. \\"We discussed ways to prevent confrontation between the army and the people, and tensions like those in Hama, in the most open and clear way,\\" he said. \\"The coming days will be important to see if the expectations are being met. We hope that internal peace and calm is achieved and steps for reform are taken.\\" The Turkish government would be monitoring events in Syria, and maintaining contacts with all parts of society, he added. Mr Davutoglu stressed that he hoped for a peaceful transition in Syria that would result in its people determining their own future. The official Syrian account of their talks quoted Mr Assad as saying security forces would \\"not relent in pursuing terrorist groups\\" to ensure the stability of the nation and the safety of its citizens. The president also insisted he was serious about a proposed reform programme. The Syrians quoted Mr Davutoglu as saying he was not carrying a message from anyone, and that Syria would be an example to the whole region once Mr Assad's reforms were enacted. Image caption The army has been deployed to crush dissent in the restive cities of Hama, Homs and Deir al-Zour Since Saturday, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait have recalled their ambassadors and demanded an immediate end to the use of military force against civilians. The Arab League and Gulf Co-operation Council have also issued statements condemning the crackdown and calling for serious dialogue. Egypt's Foreign Minister Mohammed Amr on Tuesday expressed concern that the situation in Syria was \\"heading to the point of no return\\". \\"Reforms that are soaked in the blood of the martyrs who are dying daily are of no use,\\" state media quoted him as saying. Envoys from India, Brazil and South Africa are also due in Damascus this week to appeal for an end to the killing of protesters. Ramadan protests Efforts to persuade Syria's government to halt the crackdown have had little effect in the past week, during which more than 300 civilians are believed to have been killed, including at least 14 on Monday. Despite concerted and ruthless efforts, the regime has not been able to stamp out the flames of defiance Deadlock in Syria as pressure builds On Tuesday, at least seven people were killed when troops backed by tanks and armoured vehicles overran towns and villages outside the restive central city of Hama, including Soran, Halfaya and Taybat al-Imam, where snipers have been deployed on roofs. Two sisters aged six and 11 were reportedly among the five dead brought to a hospital in Taybat al-Imam, while the Syrian National Organisation for Human Rights told Reuters news agency that at least 26 people had died. Two people were also killed in the centre of Hama, activists said. At least three others were killed in the town of Binnish, in Idlib governorate, about 30km (19 miles) from the border with Turkey, in a similar attack. Asked why Binnish was stormed, a resident who had fled told Reuters: \\"The whole town has been joining in night rallies after Ramadan prayers.\\" The army also continued its operation to crush dissent in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour, where more than 60 civilians are said to have been killed since Sunday. The Local Co-ordination Committees, an activist group that organises and documents the protests, said that more than 200 tanks had been deployed in the centre, and that security forces were carrying out raids and detaining residents. Deaths were also reported in Homs and the Damascus suburb of Irbin. Access to Syria has been severely restricted for international journalists, and it is rarely possible to verify accounts by witnesses and activists. Also on Tuesday, former Syrian Defence Minister Gen Ali Habib, who was removed from his post on Monday, denied reports that he was sacked because he was unhappy with the crackdown. \\"I affirm that they are fabricated stories that run counter to reality and aim at harming Syria and its national army,\\" he said on state TV. ||||| Reports of seven deaths in Hama and Idlib province as the Turkish foreign minister meets President Assad in Damascus. Syria's army is continuing operations in several locations, as the country's leadership is facing increasing pressure to end its bloody crackdown on anti-government protesters. At least five civilians were killed during raids on villages around the besieged city of Hama on Tuesday, local activists said. The Syrian Revolution Co-ordinating Union said five bodies had been taken to the Jwash hospital in the town of Tibet al-Imam north of Hama, including two girls from the same family, six-year old Afra Mahmoud al-Kannas and 11-year old Sana Ahmad al-Kannas. Earlier, a a rights group said two civilians were killed and several more wounded in the northwestern Idlib province bordering Turkey. \\"Operations this morning in Idlib resulted in two deaths and several wounded by security forces' gunfire,\\" the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a statement. \\"Around a dozen tanks and other armoured vehicles attacked the Binnish and Sirmeen areas\\" of Idlib. Asked why Binnish was stormed, a resident who had fled the town told Reuters: \\"The whole town has been joining in night rallies after Ramadan prayers.\\" The Local Co-ordination Committees said the town of Sirmeen was attacked from three sides, with troops carrying out house raids and arbitrary arrests. Tanks were also deployed in and around the city of Idlib, following big demonstrations there, the activists said. Turkey envoy On the diplomatic front, Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, arrived in Damascus to press the Syrian leadership into ending the violent crackdown on demonstrations. He met President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem, days after Turkey, a former close ally and business partner, condemned the violence. Meanwhile, footage was posted online, purportedly showing troops assaulting the town of Albu Kamal, near the Iraqi border, on Monday. The video showed soldiers firing tanks, using rocket launchers and Kalashnikovs against an unseen enemy. Opposition sources said up to seven people had been shot dead by security forces on Monday at a funeral in the southern city of Deraa, the cradle of the five-month uprising against Assad's rule. The funeral was for a youth who had been arrested earlier this week when he took part in a protest. His body was handed to relatives on Monday with visible signs of torture, according to relatives. Abdul Rahman said one of the dead was Maen Yousef Awadat, a leading political campaigner, who had recently been released from prison. In the east of the country, the army maintained its siege of the city of Deir ez-Zor, reportedly shelling at least one neighbourhood. \\"Armoured vehicles are shelling the al-Hawiqa district heavily with their guns. Private hospitals are closed and people are afraid to send the wounded to state facilities because they are infested with secret police,\\" Mohammad, a resident who did not want to give his full name, told Reuters news agency. He said at least 65 people had been killed since tanks and armoured vehicles entered the provincial capital on Sunday. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the reports since most foreign journalists have been barred from entering Syria. The Syrian Observatory says more than 2,050 people, including almost 400 members of the security forces, have been killed since the uprising began. Diplomatic action Assad's government disputes the toll and blames a foreign conspiracy for the unrest. But those claims have been dismissed by most of the international community, with world leaders ramping up its condemnation of the security forces' actions in recent days. India's UN ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri told reporters the three countries would be \\"calling for restraint, abjuring violence, [and] promoting reform, taking into account the democratic aspirations of the people.'' ? Lebanese and Syrians living in Beirut rallied in solidarity with the Syrian people on Monday Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain on Monday recalled their ambassadors from Damascus amid mounting pressure from the Arab world. Qatar withdrew its ambassador from Damascus and closed its embassy in July after Assad loyalists attacked the embassy compound amid protests against Doha-based Al Jazeera's coverage of the uprising. Besides Turkey, India, Brazil and South Africa were also sending envoys to Syria to appeal for an end to the violent crackdown. Officials said country's representatives were to meet \\"high-level'' Syrians on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Assad replaced his defence minister, Ali Habib, on Monday with illness cited as the official reason. State television reported that the Christian chief of staff, General Daoud Rajha, was to take up the post. The position of defence minister is a mostly ceremonial post in Syria. The professional core of the military consists of officers from the minority Alawite sect, the Shia offshoot which Assad belongs to, while most of the conscripts are Sunni. The military is effectively under the command of Assad's feared brother Maher. Assad's brother-in-law, Assef Shawkat, is deputy chief or staff and diplomats say he plays a key role in the control over the army. The European Union imposed sanctions on Habib earlier this month as part of measures against Syria's ruling hierarchy for their bloody crackdown on demonstrations. ||||| Syria defied Arab isolation and mounting international anger on Monday as President Bashar al-Assad's security forces continued attacks on pro-democracy protesters across the country. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, urged al-Assad to return his troops to barracks and release all prisoners, one of the bluntest demands yet made of the Syrian leader, after regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia led a rare chorus of Arab states in condemning the repression. Reports from Deir al-Zor described artillery and heavy machinegun fire and snipers on roofs as troops and intelligence agents carried out mass arrests in the north-eastern city. On Sunday, 42 people were killed there, nudging the death total during five months of the uprising to more than 2,000. In Hama, security forces were reported to have deployed an anti-aircraft gun to fire on civilians, diplomats said. Videos from around the country purported to show gunfire, shelling and corpses from violence over the weekend. Three people were reported to have been shot during a funeral in Deraa. In a political development, al-Assad announced the replacement of his defence minister, Ali Habib, a member of the minority Alawite community, by the army chief of staff, Daoud Rajha, who is a Christian. Analysts said the move seemed intended to emphasise the regime's claim to be defending all Syrian citizens against a sectarian conflict it says is being fomented by Islamic extremists. State TV described Habib as being in poor health and said the decision to replace him had been taken after consultations by the president. Syrian media scorned moves by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to protest against the violence by withdrawing their ambassadors from Damascus. The Sana news agency quoted an unnamed official as expressing \\"regret\\" that Arab states had \\"completely ignored facts on the killing and sabotage committed by armed terrorist groups\\". Kuwait and Bahrain followed the Saudis in recalling their envoys for consultations. On Sunday, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia condemned the crackdown in a speech that was billed as historic but was largely prompted, western diplomats said, by US pressure. Britain has also been lobbying the Saudis and other Arab states, which rarely criticise each other in public, to get tough with Syria. Qatar, which pursues more independent policies, recalled its ambassdor from Damsacus last month. On Sunday the Arab League, which represents all Arab states, had spoken out for the first time and called on the Syrian authorities to stop acts of violence against civilians. Speaking on state TV, commentator Samir Shehadi warned that Syria would in future support Shia protestors in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in retaliation for their stand. Neighbouring Jordan also expressed concern for the first time. British diplomats said they were alarmed by the arrest of a leading dissident, Walid al-Bunni, and his sons, who had been due to take part in an opposition conference. A leading human rights lawyer was also reportedly detained. Communications were patchy and details incomplete, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights quoted residents in Deir al-Zor as saying that security forces had shot dead a mother and her two children who were fleeing the assault. \\"The army opened up with heavy machine guns on al-Joura district. Security forces then launched a search sweep, terrorising residents,\\" an activist in the city told AFP. People were said to be too terrified to take the wounded to government hospitals, instead treating them at home or in makeshift hospitals. Troops also entered Maarat an-Numan in the northern province of Idlib at dawn on Monday, opposition activists said. Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, is due to meet Assad in Damascus on Tuesday and will be carrying Clinton's message to Assad to release all detained protesters, establish a new government and send his army back to barracks, Turkish media reported. Bouthaina Shaaban, Assad's media adviser, said Davutoglu would hear a protest that his country had failed to \\"condemn the brutal killing and crimes committed by the armed terrorist groups\\". William Hague, the foreign secretary, condemned the latest violence against Syrians. \\"This brutality exposes the regime's claims to be committed to a reform process as an utter sham,\\" he said in a statement. On Sunday night reporters were taken on a tour of the government-run hospital in Hama, where more than 150 fatalities have been reported in recent days, and shown the remains of 16 people, some decomposing. Dr Mohammed al-Omar said most of the bodies were members of the security forces who were killed by armed groups. Condemnation of the Syrian government spread to the internet, where the hacking group known as Anonymous claimed credit for vandalising the Syrian military's website. The site quickly became unavailable, but screenshots circulated online showed the group's trademark headless suit and a message addressed to the Syrian people saying that \\"the world stands with you against the brutal regime.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"In Syria, the government's security forces are trying to stop protesters who are against the country's leader, Bashar al-Assad.

Dioxins are recognized as a persistent environmental pollutant, regulated internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Dioxins are highly toxic, and health effects on humans include reproductive, developmental, immune and hormonal problems. They are known to be carcinogenic. Over 90% of human exposure is through food, primarily meat, dairy, fish and shellfish, as dioxins accumulate in the food chain in the fatty tissue of animals. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where are dioxins expelled in our animal sources of food?","response":"Okay, imagine you're playing with your animal toys. Some of the animals eat plants, and some eat other animals, right? Now imagine there's a yucky invisible substance called dioxins in the play area. These dioxins stick to the animals, especially to their fatty parts. When animals eat plants or other animals, they also eat the yucky dioxins that have stuck to them. And because dioxins are really sneaky, they don't leave the animals' bodies easily. Instead, they keep piling up inside the animals, mostly in the fatty parts. So, when humans eat these animals, like meat, fish, and dairy products, they also eat the dioxins that have been hiding in the animals' fat. That's how dioxins end up in our food from animal sources. But don't worry, our grown-ups are working hard to make sure our food is safe to eat!"},{"question":"The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are the major parts of the Earths core and how do they differ?\\" is \\"The major parts of Earth's core are the inner or solid metal core and outer liquid metal core\\"?","response":"Yes, that's correct. The major parts of Earth's core are the inner core, which consists of solid metal (primarily iron and nickel), and the outer core, which consists of liquid metal (mainly iron and nickel as well). The main difference between the two is their physical state: the inner core is solid, while the outer core is liquid. This distinction is important because the movement of the liquid metal in the outer core generates Earth's magnetic field as the planet spins on its axis."},{"question":"Which entity is this text about? Philip Henry Sheridan (March 6, 1831 - August 5, 1888) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. His career was noted for his rapid rise to major general and his close association with General-in-chief Ulysses S. Grant, who transferred Sheridan from command of an infantry division in the Western Theater to lead the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the East. In 1864, he defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and his destruction of the economic infrastructure of the Valley, called \\"The Burning\\" by residents, was one of the first uses of scorched earth tactics in the war. In 1865, his cavalry pursued Gen. Robert E. Lee and was instrumental in forcing his surrender at Appomattox. The protection of the Great Plains fell under the Department of the Missouri, an administrative area of over 1,000,000 mi.2, encompassing all land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock was assigned to the department in 1866 but had mishandled his campaign, resulting in Sioux and Cheyenne raids that attacked mail coaches, burned the stations, and killed the employees. They also killed and kidnapped a considerable number of settlers on the frontier. Under pressure from the governors, General Grant turned to Sheridan. In September 1866, Sheridan arrived at the former Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg, Texas, where he spent three months subduing Indians in the Texas Hill Country. In August 1867, Grant appointed Sheridan to head the Department of the Missouri and pacify the Plains. His troops, even supplemented with state militia, were spread too thin to have any real effect. He conceived a strategy similar to the one he used in the Shenandoah Valley. In the Winter Campaign of 1868-69 (of which the Battle of Washita River was part) he attacked the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes in their winter quarters, taking their supplies and livestock and killing those who resisted, driving the rest back into their reservations. When Sherman was promoted to General of the Army following Grant's election as President of the United States, Sheridan was appointed to command the Military Division of the Missouri, with all the Great Plains under his command. Professional hunters, trespassing on Indian land, killed over 4 million bison by 1874, and Sheridan applauded: \\"Let them kill, skin and sell until the buffalo is exterminated\\". When the Texas legislature considered outlawing bison poaching on tribal lands, Sheridan personally testified against it, suggesting that the legislature should give each of the hunters a medal, engraved with a dead buffalo on one side and a discouraged-looking Indian on the other. Eventually the Indians returned to their designated reservations. Sheridan's department conducted the Red River War, the Ute War, and the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, which resulted in the death of a trusted subordinate, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The Indian raids subsided during the 1870s and were almost over by the early 1880s, as Sheridan became the commanding general of the U.S. Army. Comanche Chief Tosawi reputedly told Sheridan in 1869, \\"Tosawi, good Indian,\\" to which Sheridan supposedly replied, \\"The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.\\" In Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Dee Brown attributed the quote to Sheridan, stating that \\"Lieutenant Charles Nordstrom, who was present, remembered the words and passed them on, until in time they were honed into an American aphorism: The only good Indian is a dead Indian. Sheridan denied he had ever made the statement. Biographer Roy Morris Jr. states that, nevertheless, popular history credits Sheridan with saying \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\" This variation \\"has been used by friends and enemies ever since to characterize and castigate his Indian-fighting career.\\" Entity:","response":"Philip Henry Sheridan"},{"question":"You profess yourself to be in favor of capital punishment for very serious crimes.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"If we start to clean the air and store pollution elsewhere, this could potentially help reduce the greenhouse effect. Actions that decrease the levels of greenhouse gases can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process: 1. Direct effect: By removing pollutants and greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, the amount of heat-trapping gases decreases. This can help counteract the greenhouse effect, as less of the Earth's heat radiation would be trapped by these gases, ultimately leading to lower global temperatures. 2. Indirect effect: Removing pollutants can have additional benefits, such as improving air quality and human health. This can lead to increased awareness and support for actions that combat climate change, further driving efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and control the greenhouse effect. However, this perturbation, if not managed carefully, might have some concerns as well: 1. Storing pollutants and greenhouse gases elsewhere needs to be done cautiously to avoid unintentional leaks or the release of harmful substances back into the environment. 2. It is essential to address the root cause of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. While cleaning and storing pollution might alleviate some consequences of these emissions, it is equally crucial to promote sustainable practices and transition to renewable energy sources to prevent continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, starting to clean the air and store pollution elsewhere could have a positive impact on the greenhouse effect if implemented with attention to potential concerns and in combination with efforts to address the root cause of increasing greenhouse gas emissions."},{"question":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was offered a song on the condition that he release it as his next single? ? Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property.

Between the local police and emergency workers at the hospital, said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, a director of trauma surgery at Kings County, “there is a kinship. You do develop relationships.” Last Monday, Officer Yan was brought into the Kings County emergency room with a bullet wound in his left arm. He and his partner, Officer Russel Timoshenko, had pulled over a stolen sport utility vehicle, and its occupants opened fire on them. Officer Yan was recovering at home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, but Officer Timoshenko, who was shot in the throat and mouth, died yesterday at the hospital. The three men who the police said were in the car have been arrested. Officers Yan and Timoshenko were stationed in the hospital’s home precinct, the 71st, whose members are particularly dear to the staff. “With these people from the 71st and the 67th, we see a lot of them,” Dr. Kurtz said. “Of the ones I know personally, I would be as horrified if they were injured as if they were in my family.” Officer Yan, speaking by phone on Friday, said that he was sent to Kings County on the job at least once a week. “For anything,” he said. “Even a mother that reports their child missing, after we search their building, we’ll call in and say, ‘Sarge, is it O.K. if we swing by the hospital and see if she’s there?’ ” While Officer Yan said he had not become particularly close to anyone in the emergency room — “I’m not great with the nurses, but I recognize their faces” — he said he felt welcome every time he walked in. “They’re always very friendly with us,” Officer Yan said. The camaraderie between big-city police officers and nurses, forged in the heat of trauma, is of course a staple of television dramas and movies like “Hill Street Blues” and “Fort Apache, the Bronx.” Tom Rowe, a longtime police officer in Queens who became an emergency room nurse and now trains hospital workers on Long Island, said the cliché was well grounded in reality. Police officers are often able to provide emergency room staff with crucial information about the people they bring in. “When I have police come in from the scene,” he said, “if there’s a motor vehicle accident, I can find out where the damage to the vehicle was, the speed the car was traveling; then, as a clinician, I can get a better idea of the kinds of injuries I’ll find.” But it is more than that, he said. “Basically, you’re allies,” Mr. Rowe said. “You depend on each other.” As a result, an injured officer might be “up-triaged a little bit” at the hospital, he said. He added: “That’s a respect, a professional courtesy. They don’t disregard the patients that are there, but you get a quicker look.” Certainly, the Kings County emergency room is no stranger to the swirl of adrenaline and action that accompanies the injury of an officer in the line of duty. In 2004, two veteran detectives from the 67th Precinct who were shot in East Flatbush spent their dying moments in the emergency room. “The officers looked bad, but the paramedics were working them real good, pumping their chests hard,” The Daily News quoted a hospital security guard as saying. “There was blood all over the stretchers, and other cops were yelling, ‘Hurry, hurry, rush him, rush him!’ ” In 2005, Officer Dillon Stewart of the 70th Precinct was taken to the hospital after he was shot nearby. In the emergency room, a dozen doctors and nurses went to work on him. One doctor took the officer’s heart in his hands and gently clapped it until it began to beat again, though Officer Stewart, too, eventually died. And in a terrifying episode in 1994, a prisoner being treated at the hospital jumped off an examining table, wrestled away a correction officer’s revolver, shot another officer and briefly took a 7-year-old hostage before the first officer shot him dead. Last Wednesday, in the gap between Monday’s police shooting and Officer Timoshenko’s death, it was just another night in the Kings County emergency room. The bleary-eyed injured held towels or gauze to their wounds while they waited. A police officer walked into the waiting room, thumbs jammed in his belt, looking beat. His face brightened a little when he saw a nurse in orange scrubs. “Hey, baby, how you doing?” she shouted almost maternally across the room. “Oh, not bad, not bad,” the officer said, half yawning. “Come here,” the nurse said. “Let me give you some love.” Yesterday afternoon, at a news conference shortly after Officer Timoshenko died, Dr. Kurtz emerged from the hospital. He stood beside Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly to address the latest loss. “This is a really tragic case,” Dr. Kurtz said, “one that affected us emotionally as well as professionally.” He switched modes briefly to describe in clinical detail how the bullets transected Officer Timoshenko’s spinal cord just beneath his brain. Then he spoke of Officer Timoshenko’s family. “For his mother to have lost her son like that,” he said, choking up, “it brings tears to my eyes.” The trauma surgeon stood beside the police commissioner for a few more questions. Then they wheeled away from the cameras and walked back into the hospital. Reporting was contributed by Al Baker, Michael Brick, Daryl Khan and Colin Moynihan.

In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Background: Identifying the bacteria and viruses present in a complex sample is useful in disease diagnostics, product safety, environmental characterization, and research. Array-based methods have proven utility to detect in a single assay at a reasonable cost any microbe from the thousands that have been sequenced. We designed a pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) to detect all known viruses (including phages), bacteria and plasmids and developed a novel statistical analysis method to identify mixtures of organisms from complex samples hybridized to the array. The array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based on more recent sequence data and more probes per target than other microbial detection/discovery arrays in the literature. Family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments, and plasmids. Probes were designed to tolerate some sequence variation to enable detection of divergent species with homology to sequenced organisms, and to have no significant matches to the human genome sequence. Results: In blinded testing on spiked samples with single or multiple viruses, the MDA was able to correctly identify species or strains. In clinical fecal, serum, and respiratory samples, the MDA was able to detect and characterize multiple viruses, phage, and bacteria in a sample to the family and species level, as confirmed by PCR. The MDA can be used to identify the suite of viruses and bacteria present in complex samples.","response":"Title: Pan-Microbial Detection Array for Comprehensive Identification of Viruses, Bacteria, and Plasmids in Complex Samples Using Novel Statistical Analysis"},{"question":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized... Answer:","response":"The first name of the person who made numerous amendments to the score of Rinaldo is George.

Yes; I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how do former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity Suggested answer: Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","response":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I will first break down the question and the suggested answer, then provide an assessment for validation purposes. The question focuses on the impact of former volcanoes on hydrothermal activity. To address this accurately, it is important to understand the relationship between volcanic systems and hydrothermal activity. Next, the suggested answer discusses the hazards posed by erupting volcanoes, which is not a direct response to the question. It does not address the relationship between former volcanoes and hydrothermal activity as asked. Therefore, a more thorough and accurate answer should be proposed. Hydrothermal activity refers to the presence of hot water (heated by geothermal energy) circulating beneath the Earth's surface, which can lead to geysers, hot springs, and other manifestations of geothermal activity. This action is generally associated with volcanic and tectonically active areas. In the context of former volcanoes, it is essential to consider that these sites could have once been the center of significant hydrothermal activity. Although the volcanic activity may have ceased, the geothermal systems within the Earth's crust might still be present and active, leading to ongoing hydrothermal activity. There are several ways former volcanoes can affect hydrothermal activity: 1. Heat source: Former volcanoes may still contain residual heat from previous eruptions and associated magma chambers. This heat can provide the necessary energy to drive hydrothermal systems in the area, leading to hot springs, fumaroles, and other geothermal features. 2. Fractures and permeability: The process of volcanic activity can create fractures and increase the permeability of surrounding rock layers. This allows heated water to circulate more readily through the Earth's crust, enhancing the potential for hydrothermal activity in the areas surrounding a former volcano. 3. Mineral deposition: Hydrothermal activity often leads to the deposition of minerals in the Earth's crust, which can be seen in areas surrounding former volcanoes. The presence of these mineral deposits is a clear indication of the ongoing hydrothermal activity in these regions (e.g., hot springs, geysers, fumaroles). 4. Geothermal resources: Former volcanoes and their associated geothermal systems can provide valuable resources in the form of geothermal energy. This renewable energy source can be harnessed through geothermal power plants, which use the heat generated by the Earth's interior (e.g., near former volcanic sites) to produce electricity. In summary, while the suggested answer discusses the hazards posed by erupting volcanoes, it does not fully address the impact of former volcanoes on hydrothermal activity as the question inquires. Instead, a more appropriate answer would focus on how former volcanoes can influence hydrothermal activity through factors such as heat sources, fractures and permeability, mineral deposition, and geothermal resources. Therefore, the suggested answer should not be validated, as it does not accurately respond to the question."},{"question":"Stream of consciousness rationale: One cannot be grinding on a rail down a slope while posing in front of a ski lift.

Answer: No, one cannot be grinding on a rail down a slope while posing in front of a ski lift simultaneously. Step-by-step rationale: 1. Grinding on a rail down a slope is an action that requires the person to be in motion, sliding along a rail while maintaining balance and control of their body. This is typically done using equipment such as skis or a snowboard. 2. Posing in front of a ski lift suggests the person is staying still and most likely in a standing position, allowing for a photo opportunity or simply enjoying the moment. This typically occurs while a person is at the base or on a platform near the ski lift. 3. These two activities cannot be conducted simultaneously because grinding on a rail requires movement down a slope, while posing in front of a ski lift requires being stationary.

This will help you apply your skills in practical ways and network with other students who share your interests. Question 2: The Indian government provides various subsidies and incentives for the setting up and promotion of solar power plants in the country. Some of the key initiatives and subsidies are: 1. Central Financial Assistance (CFA): The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) offers financial support in the form of capital subsidies or viability gap funding for grid-connected solar power projects under schemes like the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM). 2. Accelerated Depreciation (AD): Companies that invest in solar power projects can claim an accelerated depreciation benefit of up to 40% in a single year. This tax break encourages private sector investment in solar energy. 3. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): These certificates act as market-based instruments to promote renewable energy and ensure compliance with renewable purchase obligations. Solar power producers can sell the generated RECs to power distribution companies and other obligated entities to meet their renewable purchase requirements. 4. Priority sector lending for renewable energy projects: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has categorized loans for solar rooftop installations and other renewable energy projects as priority sector lending, allowing easier access to credit for developers and consumers. 5. State subsidies: Individual states in India also provide additional incentives, such as capital subsidies, net metering benefits, and tariff-based incentives to encourage the adoption of solar power. These incentives vary from state to state. While these policies and incentives are subject to change, they demonstrate the government's commitment to promoting solar power and renewable energy development in India."},{"question":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"The brown and white dog is running though the brush-land.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The black and white dog is asleep on the couch.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north. - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac. - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region . - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude. Four define a \\"bowl\\" or \\"body\\" and three define a \\"handle\\" or \\"head\\". It is recognized as a distinct grouping in many cultures. 'ngc 4194' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'? Choices: - association - asterism - bear - bowl - century - city - constellation - december - education - eight - equinox - family - four - galaxy - head - hobby - magnitude - march - mythology - navigation - plane - plot - plough - professional - radius - region - research - september - shape - single - six - sky - species - sphere - star - system - three - tool - union - variable The answer to this question is:","response":"galaxy"},{"question":"Answer the following question: A flask is a container can, it is made to hold what?

More than 110 others reportedly remain in hospital, while five are missing. Visiting the scene of the bombings, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi denounced the attackers as \\"cowardly\\". He vowed that their targeting of \\"defenceless citizens\\" would not deter Iraqi government forces from seeking to defeat IS, a Sunni jihadist group that controls large parts of the country's north and west. The UN special envoy to Iraq, Jan Kubis, said the \\"particularly vicious and cowardly terrorist attack\\" was \\"clearly aimed at inflaming sectarian strife\\". IS said it would continue to target Shia Muslims, whom it considers heretics. Officials said that in Sunday's attack, the first bomber blew himself up in the crowded Mredi market in Sadr City. As a crowd and emergency personnel gathered at the site, the second bomber struck. On Thursday, a Shia mosque in Baghdad was targeted by two suicide bombers, killing 15 people. With IS suffering recent setbacks elsewhere in the country, there are fears that the group will step up its attacks in the capital, reports BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale. Earlier on Sunday, IS militants launched an assault in the western suburb of Abu Ghraib, which is about 18 miles (29km) from central Baghdad and is close to the international airport.

The answer to this question is:","response":"Cuthbert Brodrick was a renowned English architect, born on September 1, 1821, in Kingston upon Hull, a vibrant maritime city in East Yorkshire, England. Throughout his career, he made significant contributions to Victorian architectural design, creating iconic buildings and leaving an extraordinary legacy in Britain. During his early years, Brodrick was exposed to the world of building and architecture through his family, as his father operated a successful building firm. His interest in the field blossomed as he aged, and Brodrick eventually decided to pursue a career in architecture. He moved to London in 1842, where he apprenticed under the tutelage of leading architect Henry Francis Lockwood. Under Lockwood's guidance, Brodrick honed his craft and gained a strong foundation in architectural design. After completing his apprenticeship, Brodrick returned to Yorkshire to establish his architectural practice. He quickly gained recognition for his innovative designs and exceptional craftsmanship, which reflected his unique amalgamation of classical and gothic architectural styles. Throughout his career, Brodrick designed numerous significant buildings, with many of them now considered to be important heritage sites. Among his most famous works is Leeds Town Hall, completed in 1858. During its construction, Brodrick encountered several challenges, including tight budgets and limited resources. Despite the difficulties, his ingenuity shined through, and he created a monumental town hall marked by a grand clock tower, a symbol of the city's prominence during the Industrial Revolution. Another one of his remarkable buildings was The Grand Hotel in Scarborough, completed in 1867. Boasting 365 rooms, the hotel served as a testament to the prosperity and optimism of the Victorian era. The design of the hotel, mirroring the Victorian penchant for opulence, included a striking central staircase, intricate ironwork, and lavish interior decorations. Sadly, Brodrick's later years saw a decline in demand for his architectural services, as public tastes and preferences moved away from the grandeur and formality of Victorian-era design. He lived a relatively modest life and frequently moved between Yorkshire and the south of England. In search of warmer climates due to his deteriorating health, Brodrick eventually settled in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands, located off the coast of Normandy, France. Cuthbert Brodrick passed away on March 2, 1905, in Jersey, leaving behind an enduring architectural legacy that continues to amaze and inspire generations of architects and enthusiasts. Today, many of his architectural masterpieces have been lovingly restored, ensuring that his innovative designs live on as treasures of British architectural history, and his extraordinary contributions to 19th-century architecture are commemorated through plaques, exhibitions, and historical celebrations."},{"question":"Background: As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson. Paragraph: Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the solute would be less soluble, case C or case D?","response":"In the given paragraph, the solubility of gaseous solutes decreases at higher temperatures.

While the text states that she played a role in the film, it does not indicate that she won any awards for this performance. The Academy Awards (commonly known as The Oscars) are prestigious accolades that recognize excellence in cinematic achievements. Winning an Oscar is an important event in an actor's career that would typically be highlighted in a summary of their most notable accomplishments. Cindy Williams herself is an accomplished actress, recognized for her performances in various film and television roles. Best known for her role as Shirley Feeney in the popular television series \\"Laverne & Shirley,\\" she wonderfully portrayed the character's funny and warm-hearted nature.

It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation. - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of Her Majesty's Exchequer, commonly known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a senior official within the Government of the United Kingdom and head of Her Majesty's Treasury.

Google knows that you might do something like that, and it also knows which state you're in if you are in the United States. Now, it's putting that information together in a tool that could find out flu outbreaks faster than traditional systems currently in use, according to CNN report. It is called Google Flu Trends. \\"What's exciting about Flu Trends is that it lets anybody---doctors, health officials, moms with sick children---learn about the current flu activity level in their own state based on the data that's coming in this week,\\" said Jeremy Ginsberg, the lead engineer who developed the tool. The tool operates on the idea that there's likely to be a flu outbreak in states where flu-related search terms are currently popular. To test the accuracy of the data, Google compared its figures against statistics filed over the past five years by the US Centers for Disease Control. It has a network of 1,500 doctors across the US who provide weekly reports on the number of patients complaining of flu-like symptoms. \\"We found we could highly accurately estimate what the flu activity levels would be in those years,\\" Ginsberg said. They also found that the Google statistics, which can be gathered daily, were up to two weeks ahead of the government's data. The government's data took time to collect because it came from so many doctors. The ability to speed up the response of health services could prove invaluable when a serious outbreak happens. The results of Google's comparisons with official health statistics will be published in the science journal Nature. Google hopes to extend the service to other countries, and may in time include other illnesses. At present, the flu data is given for each of the 50 American states. The company says there are no privacy issues involved as the trends are gathered through... Question: Which is NOT true according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Anyone around the world can enjoy the service of Google Flu Trends.\\"? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, the statement \\"Anyone around the world can enjoy the service of Google Flu Trends.\\" is NOT true according to the passage. At present, the flu data is given for each of the 50 American states and Google hopes to extend the service to other countries in the future."},{"question":"Information: - An open standard is a standard that is publicly available and has various rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how it was designed (e.g. open process).

The climax (from the Greek word κλῖμαξ, meaning \`\`staircase'' and \`\`ladder'') or turning point of a narrative work is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given. The climax of a story is a literary element.","response":"Yes, based on the description provided in the text, it is true that the climax is the point of highest tension and drama in a narrative work. The term \\"climax\\" is derived from the Greek word κλῖμαξ, which means \\"staircase\\" or \\"ladder,\\" suggesting a progression towards a peak or culmination. The climax is a crucial aspect of storytelling and serves as a pivotal moment in the plot of a story. It is at this juncture that the central conflict reaches its most intense and decisive point, usually involving high stakes, emotions, and risks for the characters involved. This moment is the result of a build-up of tension and suspense throughout the narrative, which keeps the reader or audience engaged and invested in the story. As a literary element, the climax serves several important purposes, some of which are: 1. Resolution of the central conflict: The climax often provides the resolution to the primary conflict or problem that the characters have faced throughout the story. It usually presents a decisive turning point that determines the outcome of the narrative and sets the course for the conclusion or denouement. 2. Emotional engagement: The climax is the moment when the emotions evoked by the story reach their peak, engaging the reader or audience to a greater extent. This emotional engagement contributes to the overall impact and memorability of the story. 3. Character development: The climax often serves as a critical point for character development, as the choices and actions of the characters in facing the climactic challenge can reveal their true nature, motivations, and growth throughout the story. 4. Heightened tension: By positioning the climax as the point of highest tension and drama, the story maintains a sense of anticipation and keeps the reader or audience hooked. The climax also often signifies a turning point where the action starts to resolve, and the narrative begins to move towards its conclusion. 5. Structural significance: The climax typically occurs around the two-thirds or three-quarters point of the story, functioning as a structural marker and creating a solid narrative arc. The events leading up to the climax are called the rising action, while the events following the climax that tie up any loose ends and bring the story to a close are known as the falling action and denouement. In summary, the climax is the point of highest tension and drama in a story, marking a decisive moment that ultimately influences the narrative's outcome. As a literary element, the climax is essential for developing character, engaging emotions, maintaining suspense, and providing a structural framework for the story."},{"question":"The whole spices are ground in spice grinder to medium fine powder.

The paragraph states that Kearsarge Regional High School is located in North Sutton, New Hampshire, but it does not provide any information about the size of North Sutton relative to the entire state of New Hampshire. Geographically speaking, it's virtually impossible for a town or city (like North Sutton) to be larger than an entire state (like New Hampshire). A state typically refers to a large area that consists of many towns or cities, making it larger in terms of size and population.
