Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"Step 1: Understand the purpose of hydraulics. Hydraulics systems are used in various applications to create motion, force, or control using fluid power. In cars, they are commonly used for brake systems, power steering, and in some cases, suspension. Step 2: Analyze the statement. The user said they installed hydraulics on their car to put them higher in the air. If we consider the use of hydraulics for suspension systems, it's possible to raise the car's height with the use of hydraulic lift kits. Step 3: Consider possible alternatives. Though the statement specifically mentions hydraulics, it might be more common for people to use air suspension systems, with the help of airbags, to achieve a similar result (raising the car's height) without using hydraulic fluid. Step 4: Evaluate the factual correctness. While it's not the most common approach to lifting a car, using hydraulics for raising a car's height is technically possible. Therefore, the statement could be considered factually correct. Answer: yes"},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","response":"Yes, you should validate this answer, but with some additional information for clarity. The California sales tax rate consists of a base state rate and additional local rates that vary across jurisdictions. The base state sales tax rate in California is 7.25%. This rate is composed of 6% state sales tax, 0.25% local sales tax, and 1% for county sales and use tax purposes. In addition to the base state rate, local jurisdictions are allowed to add their own sales taxes on top of the state rate, which results in the total sales tax rate being different across various cities and counties. These local rates can range from less than 1% to over 3%, making the total sales tax rate vary widely from less than 7.25% to over 10% depending on the location within California. So, the suggested answer is mostly accurate but could benefit from providing more context on the base state rate and how local rates contribute to the total sales tax rate."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: It is one of the most annoying words in the English language and it seems there is no escaping it. The word \\"huh?\\" is in worldwide use, a study found. Researchers discovered that languages spoken in countries from Ghana and Laos to Iceland and Italy all include \\"huh?\\", or something that sounds very like it. They said that while the study may sound silly, the word is an absolutely necessary part of speech. Without it and similar words, it would be impossible to show that we haven't heard or understood what had been said and this would lead to constant misunderstandings. But while other words used in the same context, such as \\"sorry\\" or \\"what\\", vary widely across languages, \\"huh?\\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \\"huh?\\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \\"huh?\\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \\"dog\\" is \\"inu\\", while the French is \\"chien\\". It is thought that languages around the world have developed their own version of \\"huh?\\" because the sound is quick and simple to form, as well as being easily understood. The researchers, said that it might seem unimportant to carry out scientific research into a word like \\"huh?\\" but in fact this little word is an essential tool in human communication. They also have an answer for those who claim that \\"huh?\\" isn't a word. They say that it qualifies because of the small differences in its pronunciation in different languages. It also can be considered a word because it's something we learn to say, rather... Question: According to researchers, the word \\"huh?\\" is very important in speech because of _ .

James maintained that the empirically observed \\"directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support\\", by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any value added by seeking supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. James's \\"radical empiricism\\" is thus not radical in the context of the term \\"empiricism\\", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term \\"empirical\\". (His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.) Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where did James prove pragmatism and radical empiricism could be dealt with separately?","response":"Imagine you have a friend named William James. He came up with two ideas - \\"pragmatism\\" and \\"radical empiricism.\\" Pragmatism is like using what works in real life, and radical empiricism is about believing only in things we can see, touch, or experience. William James said these two ideas are very close, like those magnetic letters on your fridge. But he also said we could talk about them as two different ideas. He explained this in some big talks he gave to grown-ups. People still have friendly arguments about these ideas today! But the important thing is that we don't need any extra magic to understand the world around us - just the things we can see and touch."},{"question":"Oh, the hype! I had wanted to like Honey Salt; I really did. Don't get me wrong; they do not serve bad food. They just serve it in flavors that are catered to palates that hardly ventures out the perimeter of Summerlin. Upon arrival, we found the outdoor dining area to be directly outside the entrance of the restaurant. They picket-fenced the area and hung christmas lights overhead, but it still seemed odd to be fifty feet away from Talbots (a women's clothing store). I do give them credit for trying though. Upon walking in, the bar sits on the left and the dining area sits on the right with the open kitchen toward the back of the dining area. The decoration is a relaxed chic - California style with a Hampton twist. I like it very much; it's tastefully done but not so much that it feels pretentious, which is what seems to be what Summerlin is all about, unfortunately. (Tivoli Village, anyone?) We waited at the bar for our entire party, and the bartender was very nice. I tried the Garden Mule, and it tasted like a mojito to me. It had a huge basil leaf in the drink, and I am not sure if the basil was not washed properly, but my drink had this pesticide taste to it. (Know what I'm talking about? I may be crazy, too...) I took the basil out, and over time, it tasted better... Not sure if it was the removal of the leaf or as I was finishing the drink... The staff at the bar was very nice and offered us water and all the things a good bar offers. No problems there. Upon being seated at our table, we were greeted by Casey right away. We were explained the menu, and Casey was extremely helpful with the wine selection of the night. We went with the Nobilo Icon Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2012 at the price of 43 a bottle. Now getting down to business. The bread basket was good. Nothing to write home about, but I must warn you about how good the butter is. Beware, because you will want to eat the butter with a spoon. \\"Getting Comfortable\\" (that's what they named the appetizers: We had the England Fry and the octopus. The octopus was good, but it was not spectacular (and not for the price either). It's good enough to share between two persons. The England Fry was nothing special at all, and I mean nothing. I can make better shishito peppers at home... and find much better calamari and fried clams elsewhere! Everyone I talked to raved about the scallops, I had the scallops. For 31, you get six scallops (which is more than you usually get at other places) and a handful of cauliflowers. The scallops were cooked right, not over or under cooked, but it was, once again, uneventful on the palate other than the overpowering truffle sauce. If you like truffle, then you may find this dish fulfilling. But I personally like my seafood with a hint of truffle, as how truffle should be... The bf had the sea bass, and as soon as the dish arrives at the table, I knew it was going to be not good. It looked dried and overcooked, and it tasted like it. I was not at all impressed with the sea bass at all. I would not recommend it unless dried fish is what you like. One of our friends had the duck confit salad, and it looked boring, which I personally think it's hard for a duck confit salad to look boring. It's duck confit! I digress... Our other friend, the husband of the friend who got the duck confit, had the curry. It did not seem like he was ecstatic about the curry. His wife actually literally said it tasted like \\"dirt.\\" To reflect accurately, she did say that she does not like Indian curry. All in all, was Honey Salt terrible? No. It obviously has its redeeming qualities to deserve a 2-star from me. I think the owner scaled the flavors of the food just right for the Summerlin clientele. (If you do not know what I am talking about, maybe you'll like this restaurant, and I encourage you to try it!) However, I am afraid Honey Salt can be easily overlooked for another \\"trendy chic locally grown restaurant\\" that seem to be sprouting up in the Summerlin area left and right. I personally, unfortunately, will not be coming back soon... What is the sentiment of this review?","response":"This review has a mixed sentiment. The person had some positive points about the atmosphere and staff, but they were mostly disappointed with the food and its flavors. They said they wouldn't be coming back to the restaurant anytime soon."},{"question":"The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb .

In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd with drummer Nick Mason, keyboardist Rick Wright and guitarist, singer, and songwriter Syd Barrett. Waters initially served as the group's bassist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist, conceptual leader and co-lead vocalist. - A comprehensive world view or worldview is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the entirety of the individual or society's knowledge and point of view. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics. The term is a calque of the German word Weltanschauung , composed of \\"Welt\\" ('world') and \\"Anschauung\\" ('view' or 'outlook'). The German word is also used in English. - A rock opera is a collection of rock music songs with lyrics that relate to a common story. Rock operas typically are released as concept albums and are not scripted for acting, which distinguishes them from operas, although several have been adapted as rock musicals. The use of various character roles within the song lyrics is a common storytelling device. The success of the rock opera genre has inspired similar works in other musical styles, such as rap opera. - The Jeff Beck Group was an English rock band formed in London in January 1967 by former The Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Roger Keith \\"Syd\\" Barrett (6 January 1946 7 July 2006) was an English musician, composer, singer-songwriter, and painter.

The band were signed by Murmur, and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Neon Ballroom is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released in 1999 by record labels Murmur and Epic. - Christopher John Joannou (born 10 November 1979) is an Australian musician, best known as the bassist for the Newcastle-based alternative rock band Silverchair.

Answer:","response":"Silverchair"},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the thing or person that may be immune to the venom of the Lycosa Carnivora?, using the article: Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a .22 rifle. However Holmes manages to escape, and Lestrade and the police arrest Spedding, her gang, and the pygmy., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The answer to the question, \\"What is the thing or person that may be immune to the venom of the Lycosa Carnivora?\\" based on the article, is a Central African pygmy. In the story, Sherlock Holmes and Watson discover that the villain Adrea Spedding uses a deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, to cause her victims such agony that they end up taking their own lives. As Holmes and Watson investigate the case, they visit an arachnologist named Matthew Ordway, who is believed to have supplied the deadly spiders. Although they find the real Ordway dead, they come across his journals, which mention something or someone from Central Africa that is immune to the spider's venom. Initially, this information confuses Holmes, but upon further examination of a model skeleton found at the scene, he deduces that the Central African creature described in the journals is a pygmy. With Dr. Watson's assistance, they recognize that the size of the skull and the circumference of the chest do not match a child's proportions but instead point towards a pygmy as the creature immune to the Lycosa Carnivora venom. Holmes and Watson's investigation eventually leads them to a fairground, where they capture and arrest Adrea Spedding, her gang, and the Central African pygmy, who turns out to be the one immune to the venom of the Lycosa Carnivora spider."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Its youtube heart If this is not downloaded than we can't use youtube\\" The answer to this question is:","response":"Based on the information provided in the review, it's challenging to assign a star rating.

Proto je košile svítí. Translate this to English?","response":"The text in Czech says, \\"Modré světlo absorbuje fluorescentní, které jsou přítomny v čistících prostředcích. Proto je košile svítí.\\" In English, this translates to \\"Blue light is absorbed by fluorescent substances that are present in cleaning agents. This is why the shirt glows.\\" To provide more context and an extended explanation: Fluorescent substances have the ability to absorb light in one wavelength (color), and then re-emit it in another wavelength, usually at a longer wavelength and lower energy level. This process is called fluorescence. In the case of a shirt glowing under a blue light, the cleaning agents that contain fluorescent substances play a crucial role. These fluorescent substances, often called \\"whitening agents\\" or \\"brighteners,\\" are added to cleaning agents like laundry detergents to enhance the appearance of white or light-colored fabrics. When clothes are washed with these cleaning agents, the fluorescent substances bind to the fabric and accumulate over time. When blue light (or ultraviolet light) shines on the fabric treated with these fluorescent substances, it gets absorbed, causing the molecules of the fluorescent substance to become excited. As they return to their original, lower energy state, they will emit light at a different, longer wavelength. In this case, the emitted light is usually in the visible spectrum, resulting in the fabric appearing to glow. The glowing effect can make white or light-colored clothes appear brighter or \\"whiter\\" under certain lighting conditions, particularly under ultraviolet or \\"black\\" lights. This is the reason why some clothes, especially white ones, tend to glow under blue or UV light, and why this effect is mentioned in the provided Czech text."},{"question":"Group (mathematics): Symmetry groups are groups consisting of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as the introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions.

He loves the fragrance . (IV). He loves the special letter with the gift . Q: Why is the narrator so fond of the gift ?","response":"The narrator is so fond of the gift primarily because of the emotional connection and thoughtfulness attached to it, as evidenced by the different factors mentioned in the text. Firstly, the gift has a personal touch, as it was carefully picked out by the narrator. It is this consideration behind the selection of the gift that makes it special and unique to the recipient. The fact that the narrator took the time and effort to choose something that they thought would be perfect for their friend demonstrates a deep sense of care and understanding of the recipient's preferences. Secondly, the recipient's reaction to the gift adds further value to it. He positively appreciates the gift and acknowledges the significance of the narrator's choice by stating that it would be his favorite smell since the narrator picked it out. This genuine appreciation from the recipient solidifies the connection between the two individuals and emphasizes the impact of the thoughtfulness behind the gift. Thirdly, the narrator highlights two potential aspects of the gift that the recipient might love – the special note or letter included with the gift. These notes or letters represent an additional layer of sentiment, as they are likely to contain personal messages and expressions of affection from the narrator to the recipient. Such messages add emotional significance to the gift, as they illustrate the depth of the bond shared between the two individuals. Ultimately, the narrator's fondness for the gift stems from the combination of the thought and effort they invested in selecting it and the genuine appreciation and acknowledgement it received from the recipient. The emotional significance and connection shared between these two individuals are heightened by the inclusion of a special note or letter with the gift, which reflects their bond and personal understanding of one another. In conclusion, the reason why the narrator is so fond of the gift is primarily due to the emotional connection, thoughtfulness, and love embedded in the entire process of gifting – from selecting the perfect item to the appreciation and feedback received from the recipient. By combining these elements, the gift transcends its mere material value and becomes a symbol of the affectionate bond, understanding, and care shared between these two individuals."},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Togetthetires\\"cut\\"meansasetthisredcardsomewherebetweendecks,movethedealerstackofcardsontopofthecutcardtothebottomofthedeck.","response":"The phrase \\"to get the tires 'cut'\\" seems to be a typographical error or misspelling. I will assume you meant \\"to get the cards 'cut'\\" instead. Given the context, here's the corrected text with appropriate spacing: \\"To get the cards 'cut' means a set. This red card somewhere between decks, move the dealer stack of cards on top of the cutting card to the bottom of the deck.\\" I will now provide a detailed explanation of the process: The act of cutting a deck of cards is a common practice in most card games to ensure fairness and prevent any possible cheating or manipulation of the deck. The process of cutting a deck involves the following steps: 1. The dealer or one of the players takes a standard deck of playing cards, consisting of 52 cards, or a specific number of cards as required by the game being played. The cards are usually sorted into different suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades) and ranks (from ace to king). 2. Before the game begins, the dealer shuffles the cards thoroughly to ensure a random distribution of the cards throughout the deck. 3. After shuffling, the dealer may ask one of the players to cut the deck. The player doing this is referred to as the \\"cutter.\\" 4. The cutter then selects a random point in the deck and places a 'cut' card, often a distinctive red card, somewhere within the deck. The cut card acts as a barrier, splitting the deck into two separate sections. 5. The dealer then takes the stack of cards on top of the cut card and moves it to the bottom of the deck, completing the cutting process. This effectively changes the original order of the deck, further randomizing the cards. 6. Once the cards have been cut, the dealer proceeds to deal the cards to the players as per the rules of the game being played. The purpose of cutting the deck is to maintain the integrity of the game and reduce the possibility of cheating or deck manipulation by any player. It's a simple yet essential step that helps create a fair and enjoyable playing environment for all players involved."},{"question":"News article: Convicted terrorist stabs commander to death outside home in Magnanville before taking partner and son hostage President François Hollande has convened crisis talks after a man convicted for terrorist offences and claiming allegiance to the Islamic State stabbed a French police commander to death in front of his house outside Paris, then killed his partner who also worked for the police. The 42-year-old police commander was in plain clothes when he was stabbed to death as he arrived home at around 8.30pm on Monday night in a quiet residential area of Magnanville, north-west of Paris. The attacker then entered the house and held hostage the commander’s partner – who also worked in the local police administration – and the couple’s three-year-old son. Hollande called it “incontestably a terrorist act” and said France was facing a terror threat “of a very large scale”. Elite police squads rushed to the scene, sealed off the neighbourhood, cut electricity and negotiated with the attacker who told them he was a soldier for Isis and had sworn allegiance to the group. Shortly afterwards loud detonations were heard as police stormed the house and killed the assailant. They found the woman dead and rescued the couple’s son alive. The attacker was identified by Le Monde and RMC radio as Larossi Abballa, 25, who was known to police for radicalism and already had a terrorism conviction. He had been sentenced to three years in prison, six months suspended, in 2013 for “criminal association in view to preparing terrorist attacks” over his role in a recruitment network of jihadists linked to Pakistan and Afghanistan. French media reported Abballa had recently been under close police surveillance as he had featured in the entourage of another man who had left for Syria. The French journalist and jihadhist expert David Thomson reported that Abballa had used Facebook live to post images of the attack — a video which is being examined by police. Thomson reported that while the attacker filmed himself, the three-year-old boy was behind him on the sofa. The attacker said: “I don’t know yet what I’m going to do with him.” The attacker lived alone in nearby Mantes-la-Jolie, where the woman worked in the local police station and where the police commander had previously worked before being posted to nearby Mureaux. The police officer who died was named in the French media as Jean-Baptiste Salvaing, 42, described as an assistant chief in the nearby district of Les Mureaux. He was reported to have been wearing civilian clothes at the time. Magnanville is about 35 miles north-west of central Paris. “The toll is a heavy one,” interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told reporters at the scene. “This commander, this police officer was killed by the individual … [and] we discovered the body of a woman. The assailant, the criminal, was killed. Thankfully a little boy was saved. He was in the house. He’s safe and sound. He was saved by police officers.” Islamic State appeared to claim the attack through its news agency. The Site Intelligence Group, a US-based monitor, cited the Isis-linked Amaq News Agency as saying on its Telegram channels shortly afer the attack: “Islamic State fighter kills deputy chief of the police station in the city of Les Mureaux and his wife with blade weapons near Paris.” A prosecutor said the three-year-old boy was “in shock but unharmed” and receiving medical attention. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, tweeted that “a couple of police officers had been savagely assassinated”. He added: “Refuse fear, fight terrorism.” The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, called it “an abject terrorist attack” and expressed his “infinite sadness” at the killings. He said in a statement: “The attacker was neutralised by Raid forces, who showed great composure and great professionalism and who saved the couple’s little boy. The inquiry opened by the justice authorities will establish the precise circumstances of this tragedy.” The killing in France came a day after a gunman claiming to be acting in the name of Isis shot dead 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in the worst mass shooting in US history. France hopes expanded Euro 2016 can shake off security fears to flourish Read more At the same time, France is hosting the Euro 2016 football tournament under tight security. The country is still reeling from the November 2015 jihadist attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. Police officers were known to be potential target of jihadist terrorism in France, after two officers were killed in the attacks of January 2015. One officer, Ahmed Merabet, was shot dead by the French Kouachi brothers as they fled Charlie Hebdo magazine after opening fire on an editorial meeting. Another police officer, Clarissa Jean-Philippe, was shot in the street the following day by their accomplice Amedy Coulibaly before he later took hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket, killing four. Earlier this year police shot dead a man who tried to enter a Paris police station brandishing a butcher’s knife and wearing a fake suicide vest on the one-year anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attack. Just after the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks in January 2015, police raided a terror cell in Verviers in Belgium to foil an imminent attack in which prosecutors said jihadists aimed “to kill police officers on public roads and in police offices,” The Verviers terror cell was part of a broader French-Belgian jihadist network with links to those involved in the later terror attacks in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March. But targeting police officers at their home, as happened in the Magnanville attack, would be a new type of attack. In 2014 French police shot dead a knife-wielding man who attacked three officers in a police station while shouting “Allahu Akbar”. The man, known to police for petty crime, wounded one officer’s face at the entrance to the police station in Joue-les-Tours near the central city of Tours and injured two others before he was killed. The investigation was led by anti-terror police. In 2012 the radicalised 23-year-old panel-beater Mohammed Merah, who went on to kill three schoolchildren and a rabbi outside a Jewish school in Toulouse, began his killing spree by targeting soldiers. He first killed an off-duty paratrooper who had arranged to meet someone about selling a motorbike, then killed two uniformed soldiers in Montauban, injuring a third. Days later he targeted the Jewish school before being killed after a 32-hour siege at his flat. ||||| The child was rescued and was “shocked but unharmed,” Mr Brandet said. Five detonations or shots were heard by millions on live television while Mr Brandet spoke to reporters as police stormed the home. “Negotiations were opened but it became clear that they would not succeed and police then entered the home, where they found the body of a woman,” Mr Brandet said. \\"The toll is a heavy one,\\" Mr Brandet told reporters, his voice shaking with emotion. \\"This commander, this police officer was killed by the individual ... (and) we discovered the body of a woman. The assailant, the criminal was killed. Thankfully, a little boy was saved. He was in the house. He's safe and sound. He was saved by police officers.\\" Police sources said the attacker was a former soldier and a neighbour of the couple. Witnesses heard the assailant, described as a teenager or in his early 20s, shout “Allahu Akhbar”, Arabic for \\"God is great\\". Counter-terrorism prosecutors were placed in charge of the investigation, which had initially been treated as a criminal case. A judicial source said the anti-terrorism unit of the prosecutor's office had been handed the investigation because of comments made during lengthy exchanges between the assailant and negotiators, but gave no further details. The prosecutor in the Versailles area outside Paris said the little boy was receiving medical attention. ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption Abballa attacked the police commander outside his home in Magnanville The murder of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) is \\"unquestionably a terrorist act\\", President Francois Hollande says. A police commander and his partner were stabbed to death at their home west of Paris. Their three-year-old survived. The attacker was killed in an police assault on the house. He had spent time in jail over jihadist links and had a list of targets including public figures, police say. Named by French sources as Larossi Abballa, he had also been under recent police surveillance, including a wiretap, say media reports quoting police sources. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Hollande: \\"Unquestionably a terrorist act\\" Paris Prosecutor Francois Molin said that Abballa had pledged his loyalty to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during negotiations prior to the police assault on Monday, and had stated that he was answering his call \\"to kill infidels\\". Three people linked to the man were arrested and placed in custody, he said. Image copyright Larossi Abballa - Facebook Image caption Larossi Abballa, suspected of perpetrating the attack, was sentenced to jail in 2013 over his links to jihadist groups Police say the man lay in wait outside the policeman's house on Monday evening before the ambush took place at around 20:30 (18:30 GMT). After the murder he went inside the house and killed the policeman's wife, and held their three-year-old son hostage. Abballa, 25, was shot and killed when police entered the couple's home in Magnanville at about midnight, hours after he posted a 13-minute video on Facebook Live in which he swore allegiance to IS. In the video, he was shown considering what to do with their son, according to French jihad expert David Thomson, who watched it. Image copyright Twitter Image caption According to David Thomson, at one point during the Facebook Live video: \\"The baby is behind him, on the sofa. After killing his parents he says: 'I don't know yet what I'm going to do with him'\\" \\"I don't know yet what I'm going to do with him,\\" the killer is heard saying. In the video, he also made a threatening reference to the Euro 2016 football tournament. Two Facebook accounts linked to Abballa were suspended on Tuesday morning. Police also discovered a list of six people who the suspect wished to target on his computer, reported iTELE - including two public personalities. Mr Molins said the list included \\"rappers, journalists, police and public figures\\". Abballa lived in nearby Mantes-La-Jolie and was convicted in 2013 of \\"criminal association with the aim of preparing terrorist acts\\". He was sentenced to a three-year term in prison, of which six months were suspended, for recruiting fighters for jihad in Pakistan.

It says (in French) he was previously stationed at the police station of Mantes-la-Jolie, where Abballa lived. President Hollande said he and his 36-year-old partner, Jessica S, were \\"murdered in cowardly fashion\\". \\"It's unquestionably a terrorist act,\\" Mr Hollande said, stressing that France was still \\"facing a very significant terrorist threat\\". Earlier, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said more than 100 people seen as potential threats had been arrested in France this year, including in recent weeks. 'Loud explosions' French prosecutors have launched an anti-terror investigation into the incident. Witnesses say that the knife-wielding man may have shouted \\"Allahu akbar\\" (God is great) when he ambushed the policeman, who was not in uniform, outside his home. The attacker then barricaded himself inside the house, where the police officer's partner and child were present. Interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said France's elite police Raid unit was brought in at about 21:00. Mr Brandet said negotiations were unsuccessful and a decision was made to \\"launch an assault\\" at about midnight. Witnesses reported hearing loud explosions as the officers from the Raid unit moved in. \\"This commander, this police officer was killed by the individual...

Larossi Abballa was a 25-year-old Islamic extremist convicted earlier for jihadist activities and who was under investigation by French authorities. An edited version of the Facebook video was disseminated on the ISIS-affiliated website A'maq in which the attacker threatens that Euro 2016 would \\"be like a cemetery.\\" The video showed Abballa smiling eerily after making the threat. He admitted to killing the police commander, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing, and Jessica Schneider, a civil servant who worked at a local police station. The attacker pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS and made a call for Muslims to carry out jihad on so-called infidels. \\"Pledging allegiance to my emir, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, my first words are for the Muslim community: What happened to you? What kind of sentence did you receive? How did you get to this?\\" he asked. The original Facebook video also showed the couple's 3-year-old son, a source close to the French investigation told CNN, although the attacker's Facebook page and original video have since been removed. A SWAT team was able to rescue the boy, the French Interior Ministry said. The attack occurred shortly after 8 p.m. Monday. Abballa stabbed Salvaing first and then took Schneider and the couple's boy hostage in their home in Magnanville, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Tuesday.

CNN Map Facebook video broadcast from scene At 8.52 p.m., while in the couple's home, Abballa posted a 12-minute video to Facebook, Molins said. A screen grab from the Facebook broadcast made at the scene of the Magnanville attack. During the Facebook broadcast, the child could be seen on a sofa behind Abballa, who told viewers he was not sure what to do with the boy, a source close to the investigation told CNN. He also claimed in the broadcast that he was responding to a call from a senior ISIS leader for the terror group's followers in Europe and the United States to carry out attacks during Ramadan Abballa told SWAT team negotiators that he was a devout Muslim and had pledged allegiance to ISIS weeks earlier, Molins said. After a standoff, the SWAT team raided the house and killed him, he said. At the scene, police found knives and a hit list of targets, including celebrities, rappers, police officers, prison guards and journalists, Molins said. A Quran was recovered from the attacker's car. Asked by CNN about the video, Facebook said it does not comment on any active investigations but said it works as quickly as possible to remove content that supports terrorism. Conviction for jihadist activities Abballa had been convicted and jailed in 2013 for being part of a recruiting network for radical Islamists to go to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Molins said. Police had been investigating him since February on suspicion of links to a network recruiting jihadists to fight in Syria, Molins said. Although he was being monitored, no incidents had been flagged to authorities overseeing his case, he said. He had also been known to proselytize for radical Islam. Three people -- ages 27, 29 and 44 -- were taken into police custody for questioning in relation to Monday's attack, he said. A'maq, the ISIS-linked agency, reported that an \\"Islamic State fighter\\" had carried out the killings in France. 'An abject terrorist act' Speaking to reporters Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande said that the couple had been \\"assassinated by a terrorist.\\" Police work at the crime scene Monday night in Magnanville, northwest of Paris. \\"It was undeniably an act of terrorism, both because the perpetrator -- who was taken out at the scene, thanks to the quick reaction of the security forces -- wanted it to be recognized as an act of terrorism, and the organization he had pledged his allegiance to also claimed the attack.\\" French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve described the killings as \\"an abject terrorist act.\\" He said flags would be flown at half-staff for three days. Government workers observed a minute's silence at noon local time. According to Magnanville Mayor Michel Lebouc, Abballa grew up in nearby Mantes-la-Jolie, which has a history of radicalization in its mosques. Magnanville is 45 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of Paris. Monique Fohrer, a local resident, described the standoff Monday night as \\"a war scene.\\" \\"We didn't think we were in Magnanville. We thought we were in a film, a bad film,\\" she told CNN.

The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - The Marecchia (pronounced ) is a river in eastern Italy. In ancient times it was known as the \\"Ariminus\\" which was from the Greek \\"Ariminos\\", \\"\\" (which is also the ancient name of Rimini). The source of the river is near Monte dei Frati which is east of Pieve Santo Stefano and southwest of Badia Tedalda in the province of Arezzo in Tuscany. It flows northeast into the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the Marche and is the only river that runs through Montefeltro. While flowing through Montefeltro, the river flows through the exclave Santa Sofia Marecchia, which belongs to Badia Tedalda. The river then flows past Sant'Agata Feltria and Novafeltria before crossing into the province of Rimini in EmiliaRomagna. At Torello, part of the commune of San Leo, it flows 1 km west of the Sammarinese territory Acquaviva and the San Marino River flows into it, but the Marecchia does not touch the San Marino border. Finally, the river flows past Verucchio and Santarcangelo di Romagna before flowing into the Adriatic Sea near Rimini. - The province of Rimini is a province in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. The provincial capital is the city Rimini. The province borders the independent state of the Republic of San Marino. As of 2015, the province has a population of 335,199 inhabitants over an area of , giving it a population density of 387.57 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city Rimini has a population of 147,578 inhabitants, and the provincial president is Andrea Gnassi. There are 26 \\"comuni\\" (singular: \\"comune\\") in the province, see comuni of the Province of Rimini. - Emilia-Romagna (, Romagnol: \\"Emélia-Rumâgna\\") is an administrative Region of Northeast Italy, comprising the historical regions of Emilia and Romagna. Its capital is Bologna. It has an area of , and about 4.4 million inhabitants. - Stiffelio is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi, from an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. The origin of this was the novel Le pasteur dhommes, by Émile Souvestre, which was published in 1838. This was adapted into the French play \\"Le pasteur, ou L'évangile et le foyer\\" by Émile Souvestre and Eugène Bourgeois. That was in turn translated into Italian by Gaetano Vestri as \\"Stifellius\\"; this formed the basis of Piave's libretto. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - Murano is a series of islands linked by bridges in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy. It lies about north of Venice and measures about across with a population of just over 5,000 (2004 figures). It is famous for its glass making. It was once an independent \\"comune\\", but is now a \\"frazione\\" of the \\"comune\\" of Venice. - Francesco Maria Piave (18 May 1810 5 March 1876) was an Italian opera librettist who was born in Murano in the lagoon of Venice, during the brief Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372. For statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the term Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for identifying two of the five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Aroldo ( Italian pronunciation : ( arldo ) ) is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave , based on and adapted from their earlier 1850 collaboration , Stiffelio . The first performance was given in the Teatro Nuovo Comunale in Rimini on 16 August 1857 . - Federico Fellini (20 January 1920 31 October 1993) was an Italian film director and screenwriter. Known for his distinct style that blends fantasy and baroque images with earthiness, he is recognized as one of the most influential filmmakers of all time. His films have ranked, in polls such as \\"Cahiers du cinéma\\" and \\"Sight & Sound,\\" as some of the greatest films of all time. \\"Sight & Sound\\" lists his 1963 film \\"8\\" as the 10th greatest film of all time. - Rimini (Romagnol dialect: \\"Rémin\\"; Latin: \\"Ariminum\\") is a city of 146,606 inhabitants in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy and capital city of the Province of Rimini. It is located on the Adriatic Sea, on the coast between the rivers Marecchia (the ancient \\"Ariminus\\") and Ausa (ancient \\"Aprusa\\").

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

What would be the tax benefit if I purchased a health insurance policy for Rs. 2,00,000? Options: A). no; B). yes;","response":"A). No. These two questions have different meanings and focus on separate aspects of health insurance. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each question to clarify their distinct meanings. 1. How do you find your health insurance policy number? This question is primarily focused on the process of locating and identifying a specific piece of information related to your health insurance coverage, namely, the policy number. A health insurance policy number is a unique identifier assigned to an individual's health insurance policy. It is essential when seeking medical treatment, filing claims, or communicating with the insurer regarding covered benefits or services. To find your health insurance policy number, you can try the following methods: a. Check your health insurance card: The policy number is often printed on the front side of your insurance card. It might be labeled as \\"Policy Number,\\" \\"Member ID,\\" or a similar term. b. Review your policy documents: Upon purchasing health insurance, you should receive a document outlining the details, terms, and conditions of your policy. The policy number should be mentioned in these documents as well. c. Contact your insurer: If you cannot find your policy number through the above methods, you can contact your insurance company's customer service department, and they should be able to assist you in locating your policy number. 2. What would be the tax benefit if I purchased a health insurance policy for Rs. 2,00,000? This question focuses specifically on the intersection of taxation and health insurance, particularly on the potential tax benefits or deductions available when purchasing a health insurance policy. In this case, the policy's value is mentioned as Rs. 2,00,000, which is likely the annual premium paid by the individual. The tax benefits associated with purchasing a health insurance policy depend on the tax laws and regulations in the specific country where the policyholder resides. Generally, individuals can claim deductions or tax credits for the premiums paid towards health insurance policies under certain conditions. The exact amount of tax benefit or deduction available may depend on factors such as: a. Age: In some countries, tax benefits increase with age, allowing older individuals to claim more significant deductions. b. Number of dependents: Having more family members or dependents under a health insurance policy sometimes allows for higher deductions. c. Income level: High-income earners may have access to different tax benefits compared to lower-income earners. d. Type of policy: Some tax benefits may differ between individual and family policies or based on the policy's specific terms. To determine the exact tax benefit for purchasing a health insurance policy worth Rs. 2,00,000, you will need to refer to the tax laws and regulations in your country. Additionally, you may consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to ensure accurate calculations and deductions. In summary, the two questions have different meanings, as the first question deals with locating an existing health insurance policy number, while the second question is related to the tax implications of purchasing a health insurance policy. Hence, the correct answer is A). No."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the following conversation and answer the question. M: Look what's on tomorrow, mother.

The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) was an American political party created in 1964 as a branch of the populist Freedom Democratic organization in the state of Mississippi during the Civil Rights Movement. It was organized by African Americans and whites from Mississippi to challenge the legitimacy of the regular Mississippi Democratic Party, which allowed participation only by whites, when African Americans made up 40 % of the state population. Answer this question: why did the mississippi freedom democratic party emerge at the democratic party convention in 1964?","response":"As we delve into the historical context of the 1960s, we should first acknowledge that the United States was in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, a struggle led by African Americans and their allies to end racial segregation and discrimination. The state of Mississippi, in particular, was a hotbed for racial tension and hostility towards the idea of racial integration. The Mississippi Democratic Party, which at the time was the dominant political party in the state, was essentially a whites-only organization that excluded black people from full participation in the political process, despite them making up 40% of the state's population. Given this background, let us now explore the reasons why the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) emerged at the Democratic National Convention in 1964. 1. Challenging the white-dominated Mississippi Democratic Party: A core objective of the MFDP was to challenge the legitimacy of the regular Mississippi Democratic Party, which had a history of racial discrimination and exclusionary practices. By taking their cause to the national stage during the Democratic Party Convention in 1964, the MFDP sought to expose the discriminatory practices of the Mississippi Democrats and to raise awareness about the racial injustices that African Americans were experiencing in the state. 2. Representation at the Convention: Prior to the 1964 Democratic National Convention, the MFDP held a parallel election to select an integrated delegation of representatives to attend the convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The MFDP wanted their delegates to be seated instead of the all-white, segregationist Mississippi Democratic Party delegation. The decision to bring a racially integrated delegation to the Democratic Party Convention was a strategic move aimed at proving that full participation of Black voters in Mississippi was possible and necessary. 3. Garnering national support: The MFDP intended to use the public platform provided by the Democratic National Convention to gather national attention and support for their cause. They sought the endorsement of prominent figures within the Democratic Party, such as President Lyndon B. Johnson and other civil rights leaders, to legitimize their status as the true representatives of Mississippi voters and to push for more inclusive political practices in their home state. In summary, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party emerged at the Democratic Party Convention in 1964 because they wanted to challenge the discriminatory practices of the white-dominated Mississippi Democratic Party, ensure representation for both black and white residents at the national level, and garner national support for their quest for equality, integration, and voting rights."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Article: Linus Pauling,the only person who has won two undivided Nobel Prizes,was born in Portland,Oregon. He attended Washington High School but because of an unimportant detail he did not receive his diploma until 1962,long after he had received his Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Orgon State College in 1922. He had chosen to study his major because he could get a good job with it. He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substance. His interest in the \\"behavior\\" of molecules led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts,the amino acids ,which are called the\\"building blocks of life\\".In 1950,he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule,a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell. During World WarII,Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security,for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948. However,the use of the atomic bomb near the end of the war turned Pauling in a new direction. Having long worked on the structure of molecules,he took an immediate interest in the deadly effects of nuclear fallout on human molecular structures. From then on,Pauling protested the production of the hydrogen bomb and supported the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. Through his efforts,The NuclearTestBan Treaty,declaring all nuclear tests to be illegal except underground ones,came into effect on October 10,1963,the same day Linus Pauling was awarded the Nobel Peace. Question: Which of the following things did Pauling pay much attention to at first? - The \\"behavior\\" of molecules. - Physical chemistry. - Biological chemistry. - The human body.

The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help...

A few months ago, I wrote an appreciation as a way of marking his 75th birthday. The sentiments, of course, still stand and I'm glad I didn't wait until his death to write it. We have lost a hero of our times, a friend of freedom, who lived his life with integrity and sent forward ripples of hope into the world. He will be missed and remembered. ... Draw up a compelling character representing the arc of the 20th century and it might look like this -- a child whose homeland is conquered by the Nazis and then occupied by communists; a playwright, essayist and dissident turned state prisoner of conscience turned leader of a victorious nonviolent revolution over a totalitarian dictatorship. He culminates his career as president of his newly liberated nation. This is the life of Vaclav Havel as he celebrates his 75th birthday. In a time of Arab Springs still unfolding and uncertainty about what will emerge in the place of those Mideast dictatorships, Vaclav Havel's life story takes on renewed relevance. The revelation of Havel's leadership wasn't just the triumphant nonviolence of the Velvet Revolution -- it was his bracing honesty, which was itself a revelation. Read the opening lines of his first inaugural address to the Czech people: \\"My dear fellow citizens ... I assume you did not propose me for this office so that I, too, would lie to you.\\" This is the hallmark of Havel's writing -- challenges to power rooted not in imperious ideological rhetoric but harder-to-dismiss, human-size truths. Take a look at his most enduring essay, \\"The Power of the Powerless,\\" written behind the Iron Curtain in the darkest days of the 1970s. In this classic call for everyday citizens to recognize their power to change their world, Havel uses the example of a Soviet-era grocer placing a state-sponsored sign in his store window with the slogan: \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\" \\"If the greengrocer had been instructed to display the slogan 'I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient;' he would not be nearly as indifferent to its semantics, even though the statement would reflect the truth,\\" Havel wrote. So why does he do it? \\"The sign helps the greengrocer to conceal from himself the low foundations of his obedience, at the same time concealing the low foundations of power. It hides them behind the facade of something high. And that something is ideology,\\" Havel wrote. \\"Ideology offers human beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them.\\" The power of those words ultimately helped inspire a revolution of citizen resistance to the totalitarian state. It may yet inspire more uprisings -- because beneath his appeal is not a vision of a utopian alternative, but the more basic human-scale virtue of civic responsibility, both for yourself and future generations. Havel's experience with the Nazis and Communists taught him the lesson that utopian dreams often end in nightmares. Consequently, Havel has cautionary words for the overheated acolytes of perpetual revolution and retribution. \\"Violence is well-known to breed violence, which is why most revolutions have degenerated into dictatorships, devouring their own offspring,\\" he wrote, \\"not knowing that they were digging their own graves and confining society in a vicious circle of revolutions and counter-revolutions.\\" There is this enduring wisdom as well: Havel's vision of an anti-totalitarian state ended up looking a lot like liberal capitalist democracy, with an emphasis on preserving pluralism and the uniqueness of a community. Havel was not allergic to the responsibilities of self-government, but instead embraced the mantle of authority in his own quixotic manner, never pretending to be perfect, leading by the power of his example rather than the example of his power. In office, he was a clear voice arguing for the West's efforts to intervene militarily to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. At a time when many nations seemed confused, unable to see the conflict with moral clarity, Havel helped keep the Western world focused on our commitment to \\"never forget.\\" Retired from office and often wrestling ill-health, Havel continues to write. Because he is one of the few recent world leaders who is primarily an author and artist, it is probably best to let his words speak for themselves on a few more varied subjects. -- On purposeful politics: \\"True politics, worthy of the name â€” and the only kind I will practice â€” is the politics of service to one's neighbor. Service to the community; service to those who will succeed us ... If you are modest and do not lust after power, not only are you suited to politics, you absolutely belong there.\\" -- On globalization: \\"An amalgamation of cultures is taking place. ... We are in a phase when one age is succeeding another, when everything is possible and almost nothing is certain.\\" -- On hope and persistence: \\"The only lost cause is one we give up on before we enter the struggle.\\" -- On a keeping a sense of humor: \\"Anyone who takes himself too seriously always runs the risk of looking ridiculous; anyone who can consistently laugh at himself does not.\\" We sometimes wait until people have passed to honor them appropriately. This seems like an avoidable oversight. If you're inspired to learn more about Vaclav Havel, pick up one of his many books, from collections like \\"Open Letters\\" to interview collections like \\"Disturbing the Peace\\" to ruminations and recollections in books like \\"Summer Meditations\\" and the most recent, \\"To the Castle and Back.\\" In an uncertain, always evolving world, I am certain of this: Vaclav Havel's words and example will endure and continue to provide inspiration, lighting a path forward, reminding us that history takes place in the here and now and that we all contribute to making it.

Article: Is it a tree? Is it a bear? If you're looking at a tree in the shape of a bear, it's a topiary . A topiary is a tree or bush that is trained into a shape. Growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills. A topiary gardener should make a drawing first. The drawing shows the final shape that the gardener likes. The gardener then chooses a bush for the topiary. It may be one that just planted or one that is already in place. In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century. In the sixteenth century, people in Europe liked topiaries too. By the late 1600s, topiaries were also grown in America.

The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion.

He was brought up at Long White Cloud house on the right bank of the River Thames. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who became a successful rally driver and married Erik Carlsson. During his driving career, Moss was one of the most recognised celebrities in Britain, leading to many media appearances. In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show What's My Line? (episode with Anita Ekberg). In 1959 he was the subject of the TV programme This Is Your Life. On June 12 the following year he was interviewed by John Freeman on Face to Face; Freeman later said that he had thought before the interview that Moss was a playboy, but in their meeting he showed \\"cold, precise, clinical judgement... a man who could live so close to the edge of death and danger, and trust entirely to his own judgement. This appealed to me\\". Moss also appeared as himself in the 1964 film The Beauty Jungle, and was one of several celebrities with cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the James Bond film Casino Royale. He played Evelyn Tremble's (Peter Sellers) driver. For many years during and after his career, the rhetorical phrase \\"Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?\\" was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists. Moss relates he himself was once stopped for speeding and asked just that; he reports the traffic officer had some difficulty believing him. As related in the book The Life and Times of Private Eye, Moss was the subject of a less than respectful cartoon biography in the magazine Private Eye. The cartoon, drawn by Willie Rushton, showed him continually crashing, having his driving licence revoked and finally \\"hosting television programmes on subjects he knows nothing about\\". It also made reference to the amnesia Moss suffered from as a result of head injuries sustained in the crash at Goodwood in 1962. According to the book, Moss responded by offering to buy the original of the cartoon, an outcome the book describes as \\"depressingly common\\" for its satirical cartoons about famous people. Moss is the narrator of the popular children's series Roary the Racing Car which stars Peter Kay, a role he took on, having been approached by both David Jenkins, who had the original idea, and Keith Chapman, the latter the creator of Bob the Builder, as he saw the TV show as a way of introducing motorsport to the next generation. He is one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content.

He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway.

Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The premise states that two men are sitting on a bench and they are surrounded by plant life.

A garden is typically defined as a planned space, outdoors or indoors, used for the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. 3. While the premise does mention plant life, it does not explicitly state that the location the men are in is planned or cultivated as a garden. The men could be in a garden, but they could also be in a park, a forest, or any other place with a significant amount of plant life. 4.

Here is a hypothesis: Were we seeing that tonight? Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"In order to determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to first understand both statements and study the context in which they are given. Let us examine these statements individually. Premise: \\"Were we seeing it tonight?\\" This statement appears to be a question, inquiring if there were prior arrangements to watch or engage with something unspecified (\\"it\\") at a certain point in time (tonight). Due to the lack of context, we don't have specific information about what \\"it\\" refers to; it could be a movie, a live performance, a television show, or something else entirely. Hypothesis: \\"Were we seeing that tonight?\\" The hypothesis is constructed similarly to the premise, also in the form of a question. The key difference here is the use of \\"that\\" instead of \\"it.\\" Consequently, \\"that\\" suggests the speaker is referring to something specific, perhaps in view or previously mentioned in conversation. Importantly, without context, we cannot confirm whether \\"that\\" and \\"it\\" refer to the same thing. Given the lack of context in both statements, it is not ideal to make assumptions. However, let us evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis under two different scenarios. Scenario 1: The premise and hypothesis are about the same thing. Assuming \\"that\\" and \\"it\\" refer to the same object or event, it becomes easier to compare the premise and hypothesis. In this case, if the premise is true (there were plans to see \\"it\\" tonight), then it logically follows that the hypothesis would also be true (plans to see \\"that\\" tonight), as they refer to the same subject. Scenario 2: The premise and hypothesis are about different things. If we assume \\"that\\" and \\"it\\" refer to distinct objects or events, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is less clear. In this case, if the premise is true (there were plans to see \\"it\\" tonight), it does not imply that the hypothesis is true (there were plans to see \\"that\\" tonight). Coordinating plans for one event (the premise) does not necessarily confirm plans for another, separate event (the hypothesis). To conclude, in the absence of context, it is not possible to definitively establish that the hypothesis follows from the premise. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis depends on whether \\"it\\" and \\"that\\" refer to the same thing. If they do, then the hypothesis would follow from the premise. However, if they refer to two different things, the premise does not imply the hypothesis."},{"question":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony... Guess a valid title for it!","response":"A valid title for Symphony No. 6, considering its context and characteristics, could be \\"Symphony of Innocent Complexity\\". This title pays homage to the \\"Sinfonia Semplice\\" subtitle given by Nielsen, acknowledging the seemingly simple tonal language used throughout the work. However, the addition of \\"Innocent Complexity\\" highlights the intricate textures, captivating melodies, and subtle intricacies that lie beneath the surface, revealing a deeper level of sophistication and emotional depth in the music. This title also evokes the idea that the work may appear modest or unassuming at first glance, but in reality, it is an extraordinary and multifaceted composition that defies the expectations set by its seemingly straightforward exterior."},{"question":"Premise: you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess Hypothesis: What do you prefer, ease of handling or roominess? Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? OPT: A. yes; B. it is not possible to tell; C. no; And the answer is:","response":"B. it is not possible to tell. The premise given is quite unclear which makes it impossible to accurately determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by it or not. The premise appears to be a collection of disjointed words and phrases such as \\"you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess.\\" The hypothesis attempts to clarify the premise by framing a more specific question: \\"What do you prefer, ease of handling or roominess?\\" However, as the premise itself is ambiguous and lacks coherence, it is difficult to establish a concrete connection between the premise and the hypothesis. To improve the premise, it would be helpful to provide a clearer statement or question that focuses on either ease of handling or roominess as aspects to consider when making a decision. For instance, the premise could be rewritten as, \\"When choosing a car, do you prioritize ease of handling or roominess?\\" In this case, the hypothesis would align more closely with the premise, making it easier to determine whether it is entailed or not. Furthermore, the context or subject matter that the premise and hypothesis are addressing could also provide some insight into their relationship. For example, if the topic of discussion is transportation preferences or car purchasing decisions, then the hypothesis might reasonably follow from the premise. However, without a proper context or a more coherent premise, it is currently impossible to tell whether the hypothesis is entailed by the given premise."},{"question":"Určitě ne.

One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. I am facing a new situation today: Bob and Andy are two microbiologists. They are studying bacteria: Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria, while Andy studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which researcher learned less about sulfate reduction? A:","response":"Based on the background article and the new situation with Bob and Andy, we can deduce which researcher learned less about sulfate reduction by examining their respective focus areas. Bob is studying nitrogen-fixating bacteria, which involves bacteria with the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. The background article mentioned that this environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types, and this leads to ecologically important processes such as denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis. Thus, we can infer that Bob is learning about sulfate reduction through his study of nitrogen-fixating bacteria, since it is one of the consequences of this trait. On the other hand, Andy is studying non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products as waste. The example given in the background article is ethanol in brewing. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and using different terminal electron acceptors, depending on the environmental conditions they find themselves in. While these bacteria may have some indirect effects on sulfate-reducing bacteria, the background article offers no clear indication that non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes are directly involved in the process of sulfate reduction, indicating that sulfate reduction is not the primary focus of Andy's research. From this analysis, we can conclude that Andy, who is studying non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes, has likely learned less about sulfate reduction compared to Bob, who is studying nitrogen-fixating bacteria, a group in which sulfate reduction is a more prominent and relevant process."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A person wearing a gray sweatshirt and tennis shoes is sitting on something.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A person is getting ready for a run.\\" is true?

Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves.

Options: (A) 40 sec (B) 50 sec (C) 44 sec (D) 36 sec (E) 60 sec","response":"First, I need to find out the total distance the train needs to travel to fully pass the bridge. The train is 310 meters long, and the bridge is 140 meters long, so by adding their lengths I can find the total distance. Next, I need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to meters per second so I can easily calculate the time it takes to pass the bridge. Finally, I'll divide the total distance by the train's speed, and compare the result to the given options to find the correct answer. Now, let's calculate the values: Total distance = Train's length + Bridge's length = 310 m + 140 m = 450 m. Train's speed = 45 km/hr. To convert from km/hr to m/s, I'll multiply by (1000 m/km) and divide by (3600 s/hr). Train's speed in m/s = 45 * (1000/3600) = 45 * (5/18) = 12.5 m/s. Time taken to pass the bridge: Total distance ÷ Train's speed = 450 m ÷ 12.5 m/s ≈ 36 seconds. Comparing the result with the options, the correct answer is: (D) 36 sec"},{"question":"That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it.

Low scores on such tests could serve as a \\"red flag\\" for the progressive brain disease up to 18 years before it can be diagnosed, the study authors added. \\"The changes in thinking and memory that precede obvious symptoms of Alzheimer's disease begin decades before,\\" study author Kumar Rajan, of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said in a news release from the American Academy of Neurology. \\"While we cannot currently detect such changes in individuals at risk, we were able to observe them among a group of individuals who eventually developed dementia due to Alzheimer's,\\" Rajan said. The study involved more than 2,000 black and white people from Chicago. The participants were an average age of 73. None were diagnosed with Alzheimer's at the start of the study, and each completed tests of memory and thinking skills every three years over nearly two decades. During the study period, 23 percent of the black people and 17 percent of the white people developed Alzheimer's. Those who had the lowest test scores were at greater risk for the disease. After the first year, those with lower test scores were about 10 times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those with the best scores. These odds increased as the scores dropped below average, the study published online June 24 in the journal Neurology found. \\"A general current concept is that in development of Alzheimer's disease, certain physical and biologic changes precede memory and thinking impairment,\\" Rajan said. \\"If this is so, then these underlying processes may have a very long duration. Efforts to successfully prevent the disease may well require a better understanding of these processes near middle age.\\" More information The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more about Alzheimer's disease. ||||| Objective: To examine the relation of performance on brief cognitive tests to development of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia over the following 18 years in a sample of African Americans and European Americans. Methods: A composite cognitive test score based on tests of episodic memory, executive function, and global cognition was constructed in a prospective population-based sample of 2,125 participants (55% African American and 61% female) aged 65 years and older residing in 4 Chicago neighborhoods. Time before AD dementia diagnosis was categorized into 6 groups corresponding to data collection periods: 0.1–0.9, 1.0–3.9, 4.0–6.9, 7.0–9.9, 10.0–12.9, and 13.0–17.9 years. Results: Of 2,125 participants without clinical AD dementia, 442 (21%) developed clinical AD dementia over 18 years of follow-up. Lower composite cognitive test scores were associated with the development of AD dementia over the duration of the study. The magnitude of association between composite cognitive test score and development of AD dementia increased from an odds ratio of 3.39 (95% confidence interval 1.72, 6.67; p < 0.001) at 13.0–17.9 years to 9.84 (95% confidence interval 7.41, 13.06; p < 0.001) at 0.1–0.9 years, per SD increment. These associations were consistently larger among European Americans than among African Americans. Performance on individual cognitive tests of episodic memory, executive function, and global cognition also significantly predicted the development of AD dementia, with associations exhibiting a similar trend over 18 years. ||||| The latest breakthroughs in Alzheimer’s research focus on the time well before patients even know they might have the neurodegenerative condition. Studies so far have found evidence that the biological processes that cause the mental decline may begin 10 to 12 years before people first notice signs of cognitive decline. But in the most recent report published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, experts say that the disease may actually begin even earlier — 18 years earlier, in fact — than they expected. MORE: Mental and Social Activity Delays the Symptoms of Alzheimer’s For 18 years, Kumar Rajan, associate professor of internal medicine at Rush University Medical Center, and his colleagues followed 2,125 elderly people with an average age of 73 and who did not dementia. Every three years, the researchers gave the volunteers mental skills tests, and then compared these results over time. When the looked at the group that went on to receive an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, they found that these people showed lower scores on their tests throughout the study period. In fact, their scores steadily declined with each test. For each unit that the scores dropped on the cognitive tests, the risk of future Alzheimer’s increased by 85%. MORE: Many Doctors Don’t Tell Patients They Have Alzheimer’s Rajan stresses that the results only link cognitive testing scores on broad, group-level risk, and can’t be used to predict an individual’s risk of developing the disease. For one, more research will be needed to find the range of decline that signals potential Alzheimer’s dementia. But the findings do set the stage for studying whether such a non-invasive, easily administered test can, or should be, part of a regular assessment of people’s risk beginning in middle-age. That way, he says, people may have a longer time period in which to hopefully intervene to slow down the disease process. Rajan plans to study whether brain-stimulating activities like crossword puzzles or learning a new language and social interactions can improve the test scores, and in turn slow the time to diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. At the very least, he says, the current data shows that there is a longer window of time in which people might be able to intervene in these ways and potentially delay Alzheimer’s most debilitating effects. ||||| Summary:","response":"Researchers found out that making mistakes on memory and thinking tests might be early signs of Alzheimer's disease. Bad scores on these tests could work as a warning for the disease up to 18 years before it can be diagnosed. To understand this better, imagine if our brain was like a big computer. Normally, it works very well, but sometimes it can start having problems that make it harder for us to remember things and think clearly. That's what happens when someone has Alzheimer's disease. This study suggests that people who don't do very well on certain tests might be more likely to have Alzheimer's disease later in their life, even though they might still feel fine right now.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The first step of the process mentioned would be: \\"The light energy is used to convert carbon dioxide\\". Justification: The process described is photosynthesis, which is how plants convert light energy, usually from the sun, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the ground into glucose. The glucose is then used by the plant for energy. This sequence begins with the absorption of light energy. Therefore, the first step logically would be the light energy being used to convert the carbon dioxide because it initiates the process of photosynthesis."},{"question":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are Fiddler and Fifer doing when the Wolf attacks them? ?

Practical Pig warns his brothers to build their house with \\"War Savings Certificate\\" bricks so that the house will be a solid defence against the marauding Wolf. Fifer and Fiddler ignore him and continue to play, singing \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\". As they are singing, the Big Bad Wolf in Nazi swastika regalia, attacks the two spendthrifts, and blows Fifer's straw house down. Fifer manages to escape and hides at Fiddler's stick house but the Wolf also blows it down. The two pigs run and hide at Practical's brick house.

I bought the book and couldn't wait to get started. It didn't take long however before I became quite annoyed with it. The characters were very vanilla and very predictable. The plot was so paper thin that one could see through it without trying. Worst of all, the humor was NON-EXISTANT!! Honestly, I didn't even get so much as a single chuckle in a book billed as a work of fictional humor. I'm a teacher and the entire work reminded me of something that a junior-high student would have written. A bad \\"joke\\" was made and then beat into the ground, being repeated over and over, ad nauseum. I honestly considered not even finishing the book, it was that bad.

Sentence 2: There settlement was self dependent and relied on ships. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. To provide a detailed explanation, we can break down the information given in both sentences and analyze the correlation between them. In the first sentence, we are given information about a certain settlement. The settlement is described as \\"fiercely independent,\\" which suggests that it relies largely on its own resources and capabilities. The sentence also explicitly states that the settlement possesses its own fishing fleet and shipbuilding industry. This information tells us that the people in the settlement have the means to generate their food and resources from the sea (e.g., fishing) and the ability to construct the necessary tools and equipment to do so (e.g., shipbuilding). Now, let's turn to the second sentence. It asserts that \\"the settlement was self-dependent and relied on ships.\\" The notion of self-dependency aligns with the \\"fiercely independent\\" characteristic mentioned in the first sentence. It conveys the idea that the settlement sustains itself without depending heavily on external assistance. Furthermore, the phrase \\"relied on ships\\" in the second sentence also connects with the information in the first sentence, which established that the settlement had its own fishing fleet and shipbuilding industry. In summary, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence as both convey the idea of the settlement being independent and self-reliant, with a significant focus on ships for sustenance and resource generation. The second sentence serves as a concise summary or paraphrase of the main ideas presented in the first sentence without adding any contradictory information."},{"question":"Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"He poured cake into a cup\\" - Sentence B: \\"He poured coffee into a cup\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"Alright, let's analyze both sentences step by step to determine which one doesn't make sense. 1. Sentence A: \\"He poured cake into a cup\\" In this sentence, there are three main components: the subject (He), the verb (poured), and the object (cake). Let's examine their combination: - The subject, \\"He,\\" implies that a person is performing an action. - The verb, \\"poured,\\" implies the action of transferring a fluid or granular substance by tilting a container. - The object, \\"cake,\\" is a baked dessert usually made of flour, sugar, eggs, and other ingredients. When we combine these three components, the sentence states that someone is transferring cake as a fluid or granular substance into a cup by tilting a container. However, cakes are typically solid, rather than fluid or granular. This combination of components is therefore quite unusual and doesn't make logical sense. 2. Sentence B: \\"He poured coffee into a cup\\" In this sentence, we also have three main components: the subject (He), the verb (poured), and the object (coffee). Let's examine their combination: - The subject, \\"He,\\" again implies that a person is performing an action. - The verb, \\"poured,\\" remains the same as in Sentence A, suggesting the action of transferring a fluid or granular substance by tilting a container. - The object, \\"coffee,\\" is a beverage made by brewing ground coffee beans in boiling water. When we combine these three components, the sentence states that someone is transferring coffee as a fluid substance into a cup by tilting a container. This action is quite common and logically consistent, as coffee is indeed a fluid that can be poured. Conclusion: After analyzing both sentences, it is clear that Sentence A (\\"He poured cake into a cup\\") doesn't make sense. The combination of the verb \\"poured\\" and the object \\"cake\\" results in a logically inconsistent action, as cakes are typically solid and not pourable like fluids or granular substances. Sentence B (\\"He poured coffee into a cup\\"), on the other hand, is logically consistent and makes sense."},{"question":"Article: John had been on a business trip for three weeks. It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \\"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . \\"No, I have to have roses,\\" he said, \\"My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite.\\" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, \\"Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars.\\" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, \\"Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her.\\" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally.

The comment is divided into two parts: 1. \\"he was just joking - said Sara Huck-sand\\" 2. \\"he can't take a joke about the size of his weenie, but he jokes about nukes\\" In the first part of the comment, there isn't any explicit portrayal of sexual matters, so it would be classified as non-sexual-explicit. In the second part of the comment, there is a reference to \\"the size of his weenie\\" which is an informal term for a male's genitalia. This reference is explicit and portrays sexual matters, so this part of the comment would be classified as sexual-explicit. Based on the analysis of both parts of the comment, the overall classification of the comment would be sexual-explicit due to the presence of explicit sexual matters in the second part of the comment."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Jan began to feel ill, so Jesse decided to take them to a doctor. Given the context: What will happen to Jan? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, Jan is experiencing some form of illness in which the symptoms have become significant enough for Jesse to take notice and decide that medical intervention is necessary. Consequently, Jesse will be taking Jan to a doctor to diagnose the possible cause of these symptoms and receive a proper course of treatment. Upon arriving at the doctor's office or medical facility, Jan will likely have to provide some information about their medical history, current symptoms, and any other relevant factors that may help the doctor in determining the cause of their illness. This could include the onset and duration of symptoms, recent travel experiences, exposure to potentially harmful substances, and any known allergies. The doctor will then proceed to conduct a thorough examination of Jan, which may include checking vital signs, such as blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, as well as conducting any necessary physical exams focused on the affected areas or symptoms. In some cases, the doctor may also request diagnostic tests, such as laboratory work, X-rays, or other imaging studies, to gain further insights into Jan's condition and rule out any potential underlying conditions or complications. Once the doctor has gathered sufficient information from the examination and any needed tests, they will diagnose Jan with the most likely cause of their illness. This could range from a common ailment like a viral or bacterial infection to more serious conditions such as an autoimmune disorder or organ dysfunction. The doctor will then discuss the diagnosis with Jan and Jesse, explaining the potential causes, any recommended treatment options, and the expected recovery time. Depending on the severity of Jan's condition and the doctor's recommendations, the course of treatment can vary significantly. In more mild cases, they may be prescribed medication to manage their symptoms, such as pain relievers or anti-inflammatory drugs, and advised to rest and stay hydrated until their condition improves. In more severe cases, more aggressive treatments like hospitalization or surgery may be necessary to address the underlying cause of their illness or reduce the risk of complications. Throughout the treatment process, Jan may be required to attend follow-up appointments to ensure their condition is improving and adjust their treatment plan accordingly. Depending on the nature of Jan's illness, their recovery may be relatively quick and straightforward, or they may need additional support from healthcare professionals, such as specialists or rehabilitation services, to facilitate a full recovery. Overall, Jan's experience and prognosis will depend on the specific cause of their illness, the timeliness and appropriateness of their treatment, and any other individual factors that may impact their health. Ultimately, Jesse's decision to take Jan to a doctor will play a crucial role in ensuring they receive the necessary care to address their illness, improve their well-being and return to their daily lives as quickly and safely as possible."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

Based on the paragraph provided, one can indeed conclude that to push oneself when running, it is effective to choose a motivational phrase and repeat it constantly in one's mind before, during, and after the run, whilst maintaining a positive tone. The paragraph asserts that maintaining positivity is a method that often works, hence agreeing with the statement in question. Moreover, the concept of using positive mantras is an established technique widely used in various settings, not limited to physical activity or exercise, to instigate motivation, perseverance, and a general positive mindset toward the task at hand. In actual running or exercise settings, having a mantra can act as a distraction from physical exhaustion and discomfort, enables one to focus on the task at hand, and provides an extra psychological boost to push through the tough parts of a workout or run. Keeping the mantra 'short and positive' ensures that it's easy to remember even when physically strained, and that it imparts a positive, upbeat energy. That being said, it's important to note that different methods work for different individuals. While this could be an effective technique for some, others may find different techniques more suitable for their personal preferences or circumstances. However, within the context supplied by the paragraph, using a positive mantra is indeed portrayed as a possible way to 'push yourself when running.'

Lorraine Kelly came top of the pile for women in their 50s. Helen Mirren was the style icon for women in their 60s. 15% said they often dressed like their favourite celebrity. More than a quarter have tried to find out where a piece of clothing was from. Article:","response":"Title: Style Icons Across the Ages: Women in the UK Look to Royals and Celebrities for Fashion Inspiration There is no denying that our favorite celebrities and public figures have a significant impact on our style choices. Time and time again, we find ourselves drawn to their ensembles, captivated by their unique sense of fashion. Often, we may even go out of our way to replicate these style icons' outfits ourselves. A recent survey revealed that the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, is considered the most copied style icon for women in their 30s. Renowned for her sophisticated yet accessible sense of fashion, the Duchess has remained a popular figure of admiration not only in the UK but worldwide. Meanwhile, Scottish television presenter Lorraine Kelly has emerged as the go-to style guru for women in their 50s. Known for her effortless, chic, and age-appropriate dressing, Kelly is the embodiment of elegance and grace. Her approach to fashion showcases the perfect blend of style and practicality, resonating well with women in this specific age demographic. The iconic Dame Helen Mirren, famous for her exceptional acting talent and unfaltering beauty, takes the crown as the style icon for women in their 60s. Mirren has long been admired for her ability to exude sex appeal and breaking age stereotypes, demonstrating that style and fashion never go out of date—no matter the age. It's no surprise that 15% of the respondents claimed they often dressed like their favorite celebrity, with more than a quarter admitting that they've tried to find out where a piece of clothing was from to emulate the outfit themselves. As these famous faces set the trend, we are naturally drawn to emulate them and seek hints of their glamour, hoping to incorporate elements of their style in our own wardrobes. Celebrity influence seems to know no bounds. From posting images on social media channels to appearing in magazines and movies, they captivate our attention and, in some cases, drive our purchasing decisions. For many of us, they are seen as the ultimate authorities in what constitutes fashion, charm, and beauty. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the human tendency to admire and imitate others has long been ingrained in our psyche. Celebrities, in their elevated status, often present aspirational figures to their fans and followers. Secondly, the media and advertising industries work hard to create favorable associations between celebrities and certain products or fashion trends. In conclusion, style icons like the Duchess of Cambridge, Lorraine Kelly, and Helen Mirren are not only sources of inspiration for many women but also an essential part of our culture. Their influence drives fashion trends, encourages self-expression, and helps create a sense of individuality while still enabling us to feel connected to our favorite celebrities. Their impact transcends age and demographics, proving that fashion can be empowering and unifying. As women of different age groups gain inspiration from these icons, we continue to celebrate our shared love for style and fashion and appreciate the role these public figures play in inspiring and guiding our everyday wardrobe choices."},{"question":"Choose how you want this story to end.

A week-long stay at the Forte Village Resort costs around £4,000 for a family of four, and now parents can feel confident that their children are participating in a diverse, positive, and value-based experience. In addition to revamping their child-themed offerings, Forte Village Resort also made an effort to engage with parent and advocacy groups to gather feedback and understand the importance of avoiding gender stereotyping. The resort wins over former critics with their commitment to providing equal opportunities for all children, regardless of gender or interests. As a result, The Forte Village Resort is lauded for its progressive move towards inclusivity, eventually becoming known as a shining example of how luxury family resorts should cater to the diverse needs of their clientele. Families from all around the world flock to this resort, not only for its high-end amenities and stunning location but also for its dedication to providing memorable, inclusive, and enriching experiences for all children."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

O’Connor has stepped back from public life. The nation’s first... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, has stepped back from public life. For more than a decade after leaving the court in 2006, O'Connor kept up an active schedule: serving as a visiting federal appeals court judge, speaking on issues she cared about and founding her own education organization. But the 88-year-old, for more than two decades often the deciding vote in important cases, is now fully retired. She made her last public appearances over two years ago. This summer she turned over an office she had kept at the Supreme Court to the court's most recently retired justice, Anthony Kennedy. Her son Jay O'Connor said in a recent telephone interview with The Associated Press that his mother, like many who reach their upper 80s, began to have challenges with her short-term memory. That made some public events more difficult. Hip issues have meant she now primarily uses a wheelchair. And she now stays close to her home in Phoenix, he said. \\"When she hit about 86 years old she decided that it was time to slow things down, that she'd accomplished most of what she set out to do in her post-retirement years, that she was getting older physically and her memory was starting to be more challenging, so the time came to dial back her public life,\\" said Jay O'Connor. His mother is no longer doing interviews. Over about the past year, Jay O'Connor and his brother Brian cleared out O'Connor's Supreme Court office and went through hundreds of boxes of files and other items she had in the building's basement. A gavel used at her 1981 confirmation hearing, her Presidential Medal of Freedom and T-shirts made annually by an exercise class she started at the high court are among the items O'Connor has now donated to the court's collection, the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian. O'Connor was a state court judge before being unanimously confirmed to the Supreme Court at 51. She had graduated third in her class from Stanford Law School and was the first woman to lead the Arizona state senate. On the Supreme Court, her votes were key in cases about abortion, affirmative action and campaign finance as well as the Bush v. Gore decision effectively settling the 2000 election in George W. Bush's favor. She was 75 when she announced her retirement from the court in 2005. It was a decision influenced by the decline in the health of her husband, John O'Connor III, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Her departure was a moment not unlike Kennedy's retirement this summer. The fellow Reagan appointees were moderate conservatives who often held the key vote in high-profile cases. O'Connor's retirement and replacement by Justice Samuel Alito shifted the court right, making Kennedy's vote the often-pivotal one. Kennedy's replacement by Justice Brett Kavanaugh is expected to shift the court right again. For her part, O'Connor wasn't always delighted with the court's more conservative direction after she left. Asked at a 2009 event how she felt about the court retreating from or undoing rulings she was instrumental in shaping, she responded: \\"What would you feel? I'd be a little bit disappointed. If you think you've been helpful, and then it's dismantled, you think, 'Oh, dear.' But life goes on. It's not always positive.\\" After the court's 2010 Citizens United ruling allowing corporations to spend freely on elections for Congress and president, she told an audience: \\"Gosh, I step away for a couple of years and there's no telling what's going to happen.\\" Still, that year she told an interviewer that she didn't \\"regret for one minute\\" retiring when she did. O'Connor found other ways to make a mark off the court. In 2009, the same year her husband died, she founded the group iCivics, which promotes civic education in schools through free, educational online games. O'Connor has called it \\"the most important work I've ever done.\\" Last year, the group's 19 games were played by 5 million students. Even as she was championing iCivics, O'Connor was working on other projects. She wrote a children's book and a book about the history of the court. She served as a visiting appeals court judge, participating in more than 175 cases on appeals courts nationwide. And she campaigned to persuade states that judges should be appointed, not elected, to preserve judicial independence. One of the last times O'Connor made public comments was in 2016, after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Interviewed by an Arizona television station, O'Connor was asked what she thought about Republican senators' argument that the conservative justice's seat should be filled not by President Barack Obama but his successor because the vacancy happened in a presidential election year. She said she disagreed. \\"I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it,\\" she said, a recommendation Republicans didn't heed, holding the seat open until President Donald Trump could choose Scalia's successor, Neil Gorsuch. Though O'Connor has stepped back from public life, the court's other retired justices have varying degrees of public presence. David Souter, 79, lives in New Hampshire but rarely speaks publicly. Kennedy, 82, has already started making post-retirement appearances. Florida resident John Paul Stevens is still making appearances at 98. Three women now serve on the Supreme Court, a development O'Connor approved of. \\"It's all right to be the first to do something, but I didn't want to be the last woman on the Supreme Court,\\" she said in 2012. ___ Follow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jessicagresko ||||| FILE - In this Aug. 12, 2009 file photo, President Barack Obama presents the 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Sandra Day O'Connor.

Translate to English","response":"Indicators serve as the foundation for designing an appropriate monitoring system. Indicators play a crucial role in the development and implementation of a well-functioning monitoring system. These measurable components provide essential information on the progress and effectiveness of various projects, programs, or policies in different sectors. In turn, this data allows decision-makers to evaluate the impact of their work, identify areas for improvement, and adapt their strategies accordingly. This helps ensure that the monitoring system effectively supports the desired outcomes and contributes to the overall success of any given initiative. There are several types of indicators, such as input, output, outcome, and impact indicators. Each serves a unique purpose within a monitoring system, and the selection of appropriate indicators depends on the specific objectives of a project or program. 1. Input indicators measure the resources and efforts invested in an initiative and can include factors like staff, budget, training, and other materials or equipment. These indicators help to assess the efficiency of resources allocation and enable comparisons with similar initiatives. 2. Output indicators measure the immediate results of a project or program, focusing on the tangible goods or services produced. Examples include the number of workshops held, the construction of infrastructure, or the distribution of materials. Output indicators help track progress and ensure milestones are met in a timely manner. 3. Outcome indicators assess the short- to medium-term effects of a project or program on its target population or beneficiaries. These indicators are directly linked to the stated objectives of an initiative and can include changes in knowledge, attitude, behavior, or skills. Outcome indicators provide valuable information for evaluating the effectiveness of a project and determining whether it is on track to achieve its intended goals. 4. Impact indicators measure the long-term and broader effects of a project or program on its target population or an entire sector. These indicators are often associated with changes in the systemic, structural, or environmental dimensions that can result from successful interventions. Impact indicators are vital for assessing the overall value and contribution of a project or program to larger development goals. Choosing the right set of indicators is crucial to the effectiveness of a monitoring system. Indicators must be understandable, credible, relevant, and easily measurable. In designing an appropriate monitoring system, it is essential to involve various stakeholders, including project staff, decision-makers, and beneficiaries, to ensure the chosen indicators accurately reflect the needs and desired outcomes of the project or program. In conclusion, indicators serve as the foundation for designing an appropriate monitoring system by providing essential information on the progress and effectiveness of projects and programs.

We are given this equation: 0 = 719*z + 74*z - 87*z + 16944 Our job is to find the value of z. To do that, let's first add up all the z parts: 719*z + 74*z - 87*z = (719 + 74 - 87) * z = 706 * z Now, the equation looks like this: 0 = 706*z + 16944 We want to get z all by itself. So, let's move the 16944 to the other side of the equation by subtracting 16944 from both sides: 0 - 16944 = 706*z -16944 = 706*z Now, we need to get z by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 706: -16944 ÷ 706 = z After dividing, we will find the value for z: z ≈ -24 So, z is approximately equal to -24.

What is her net profit? If the answer is '50'; explain the reasoning:","response":"To calculate Elizabeth's net profit, we'll first determine her total costs and her total revenue, then subtract the costs from the revenue. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: Step 1: Calculate total costs Elizabeth uses 3.00 worth of ingredients for each bag of granola and makes 20 bags. So the total cost is 20 bags * 3.00 = 60.00. Step 2: Calculate total revenue She sells 15 bags for 6.00 each and then marks down the remaining 5 bags to 4.00 each. Revenue from the first 15 bags: 15 bags * 6.00 = 90.00. Revenue from the last 5 bags: 5 bags * 4.00 = 20.00. Total revenue: 90.00 + 20.00 = 110.00. Step 3: Calculate net profit Net profit = Total revenue - Total costs Net profit = 110.00 - 60.00 = 50.00. So, Elizabeth's net profit is 50.00. The reasoning behind this is that she earned a total of 110.00 in revenue from selling all 20 bags, and then we subtracted the 60.00 cost of making those bags, resulting in a net profit of 50.00."},{"question":"Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left. Question: suppose less birth control pills used happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"It can be assumed that there is no direct connection between the use of birth control pills and the weathering process of wood. The primary factors causing weathering on wood are environmental, such as wind, water, and temperature changes. However, if we consider the indirect effects of using less birth control pills, which could lead to an increased population, there might be a minor influence on the environment. An increased population may create more demand for resources, which in turn could lead to more deforestation and loss of natural habitats. This increased demand for resources can potentially have an effect on the weather patterns, as it can contribute to climate change over time. Putting all these assumptions together, it can be said that using less birth control pills may have a very minimal and indirect effect on slowing down the weathering of wood, through potential changes in the environment and climate. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the connection between birth control pills and weathering is quite weak, and numerous other factors play a more significant role in determining the weathering process.

At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).Albrecht Dürer was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful.

The group started as a children's group in 1982 and managed to evolve successfully into adulthood. Timbiriche is considered one of the most iconic Latin Pop acts of the 1980s and the early 1990s. It was the seed of numerous figures in the Latin American entertainment world, including successful singers like Thalia, Paulina Rubio and Edith Marquez, as well as actors, composers and conductors. After a few months of preparation, Timbiriche made its official debut on April 30, 1982 on the Mexican television show Siempre en Domingo, featuring Spanish singer Miguel Bose as its godfather. The group launches their first record production titled Timbiriche, which included the hit singles Amor para ti, Hoy tengo que decirte Papa, Y la fiesta comenzo and Somos amigos. Due to the success obtained, and in order to have a wider repertoire in their presentations, the group recorded a second album titled La Banda Timbiriche, which included the hit singles La Banda Timbiriche, La vida es mejor cantando, Mexico and Mama . The group is also chosen to interpret the musical theme of the children's telenovela Chispita. In that same year, the group participates in a special of television where it shares scene with the group Parchis. In 1983, the group released the album La Banda Timbiriche: En Concierto an album that was released under the concept of being a live album, although in fact the sound effects of the public were added in the recording studio. The album includes covers of songs in English and of musicals famous at that time like Time Warp of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, One Step (cover of Liza Minnelli and Goldie Hawn' song), Summer Nights (from the musical Grease) and Mickey (cover by Toni Basil). In this third album, the group already enjoyed a great acceptance in Mexico, receiving several disks of gold by the high sales of its albums. At that moment of the group, the voices of the only two male members of the group were confused with those of the female members due to their young age. Because of this, the producers considered the idea of integrating a third male member into the group. The chosen one was Erik Rubin, who joins the band in December 1983. The band launches its fourth disc, titled Timbiriche Disco Ruido. The album was the first big challenge of the band, because it was not known what the public reaction would be to the new member, who had to go through many conflicts to adapt with his peers. However, the album had a good reception and contained hits such as Disco ruido and Adios a la escuela.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"Section 8 housing, also known as the Housing Choice Voucher Program, is a federal program in the United States managed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the U.S. government. Its primary purpose is to provide financial assistance in the form of housing vouchers to low-income families, seniors, and disabled individuals to help them afford safe, decent, and sanitary housing in the private market. The program allows families to choose the type of housing they prefer, including apartments, single-family homes, or townhouses that meet program requirements. Section 8 housing is not limited to public housing projects or specific subsidized buildings — rather, it allows tenants to search for housing in any area or neighborhood, as long they meet the requirements set by the HUD. The assistance provided through the Section 8 program comes in the form of a housing voucher. This voucher is given to the eligible individual or family, and they are responsible for finding a landlord who accepts Section 8 vouchers. Once a suitable rental unit is found and the landlord agrees to accept the voucher, the Public Housing Authority (PHA) pays the difference between the tenant's portion of the rent and the actual market rent directly to the landlord. The tenant's portion of the rent is calculated based on their income. In general, the tenant pays 30% of their adjusted gross income towards rent and utilities, while the housing voucher covers the remaining balance. The maximum voucher amount varies depending on multiple factors, such as the size of the rental unit and the local Fair Market Rent (FMR). The 2,200 maximum voucher amount you mentioned is not a universally correct answer. This figure may apply to specific areas or rental situations, but it is not an accurate representation of how the Section 8 program works across the United States as a whole. The maximum allowed voucher varies from one location to another and depends on several factors, such as the family size and the number of bedrooms. In conclusion, Section 8 housing is a federal assistance program aimed at making housing more affordable to low-income families and individuals. The 2,200 maximum voucher amount you found may not be applicable to all situations or locations, as it is subject to local conditions and participant eligibility. It's essential to consult with the local PHA or conduct thorough research to gain accurate information about the Housing Choice Voucher Program in your area."},{"question":"Duplexapartmentwithaterraceof30sqmandaninteriorsurfaceareaofabout85sqmonthegroundfloor.

We can do this by subtracting 12*q from both sides of the equation: 37*q - 12*q = 12*q - 12*q + 250 This simplifies to: 25*q = 250 To solve for q, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation, which we can do by dividing both sides of the equation by 25: 25*q / 25 = 250 / 25 This simplifies to: q = 10 So, the solution to the equation is q = 10."},{"question":"Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. Question: \\"Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago near Lisbon following the orders of which leader?\\" Response: \\"Madiera\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? OPTIONS: a). no; b). yes;","response":"a). no; The correct response to the question should be \\"Henry the Navigator.\\" The paragraph mentions that João Gonçalves Zarco was sailing in the service of Prince Henry when he discovered the small volcanic archipelago that later became Madeira. The response \\"Madiera\\" is the name of the archipelago itself, not the leader who ordered the exploration."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Solution A: Placing the water bottle horizontally and filling the bottle through the side of the opening In this solution, the water bottle is placed on a horizontal surface, such as a table or countertop, with the opening exposed horizontally. This means the water is poured along the opening's side until it begins to fill the bottle. Pros: - The water bottle is less likely to tip over as it has a stable base while lying horizontally. - This method might be more accessible for individuals with limited mobility or difficulty lifting the water source. Cons: - Filling the bottle at this angle might require a steady hand and precise aim to avoid spilling water outside the bottle. - Water may accumulate along the interior sides of the bottle, creating uneven distribution and potentially altering the bottle's center of gravity as it fills up. This could make it unstable and prone to tipping over. - There is a risk of air bubbles forming inside the bottle as the water flows in, which can create pockets of void space and limit the bottle's overall capacity. - This position would allow less control over the water flow, which might result in overflow and spillage if not carefully monitored. Solution B: Placing the water bottle vertically and filling the bottle through the opening at the top In this solution, the water bottle is positioned upright on a surface, with the opening facing upwards towards the sky. This allows water to flow directly into the bottle from above. Pros: - Gravity aids the water flow, resulting in faster and more efficient filling of the bottle. - Monitoring and controlling the flow of water is significantly easier, reducing the risk of overflow and spillage. - The vertical orientation allows the air bubbles to naturally exit the bottle as it fills, optimizing the overall capacity and minimizing void space. - The even distribution of water lessens the risk of the bottle becoming destabilized or tipping over. Cons: - The water bottle might be more prone to tipping over when it's empty or partially filled, as its base may be less stable than when positioned horizontally. - Individuals with mobility difficulties may find it more challenging to lift a heavy water source over the opening. Considering the pros and cons of both solutions, Solution B (placing the water bottle vertically and filling the bottle through the opening at the top) appears to be the more sound and practical solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. While both methods are plausible, Solution B provides more control over the water flow, maximizes bottle capacity, minimizes spillage chances, and allows for more natural interaction with gravity. This makes it the preferable choice for filling up a water bottle efficiently and effectively."},{"question":"Hawk Films was a British film production company formed by Stanley Kubrick for his 1964 film \\"Dr. Strangelove\\".

I will then determine if the two questions are the same. 1. Why are there so few women in engineering? Step 1: Research historical context I would gather data on gender roles and expectations throughout history and explore how these societal norms might have played a role in creating a male-dominated engineering field. Step 2: Identify modern barriers I would examine the present-day factors that continue to contribute to this disparity, including limited access to education or mentorship, gender stereotypes, bias, and potential discrimination in the field. Step 3: Analyze the impact of educational institutions I would investigate the role educational institutions play in nurturing or discouraging females' interest in pursuing engineering careers. This can include the availability of STEM programs in schools, the gender ratio of students in engineering classes, or the support and opportunities offered by educators. 2. Why are there so few women who are engineering majors? Step 1: Examine the recruitment process I would look at how engineering majors are recruited, considering the role of pursuasive communications in encouraging or discouraging women to pursue this field. Step 2: Evaluate the educational environment I would explore the impact of the educational environment on retaining female engineering students, such as the presence of supportive professors and peers, resources available to women, and the overall campus culture regarding gender equality. Step 3: Analyze dropout rates and potential causes I would gather data on dropout rates among female engineering students and examine potential causes for these rates, such as a lack of representation and role models, feelings of isolation, or difficulties balancing academic and personal life. After analyzing both questions, I would conclude that while they are related, they are not exactly the same.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself?

In order to reduce global warming we need to make our carbon footprints smaller. But how much CO2are we responsible for? A new book by Mike Berners Lee, an expert, might be able to help. The carbon footprint looks at the different things we do and buy, and calculates the amount of CO2all of the following created: the ingredients, the electricity, the equipment, the travel and commuting of the beer, and the packaging. It's amazing how many different things need to be included in each calculation. And it's frightening how much carbon dioxide everything produces. This can help us decide which beer to drink. From Berners Lee's calculations, it's clear that a pint (568ml) of locally _ beer has a smaller carbon footprint than a bottle of imported beer. This is because the imported beer has been transported from far away, and it uses more packaging. The local beer only produces 300g of CO2, but the imported beer produces 900g! So, one pint of local beer is better for the environment. Berners Lee has even calculated the carbon footprint of cycling to work. Nothing is more environmentally friendly than riding a bike, surely? Well, it depends on what you've had to eat before. To ride a bike we need energy and for energy we need food. So if we eat a banana and then ride a kilometer, our footprint is 65g of CO2. However, if we eat bacon before the ride, it's 200g. In fact, bananas are good because they don't need packaging, they can be transported by boat and they grow in natural sunlight. So, does this mean that cycling is bad for the environment? Absolutely not, for a start, if you cycle, you don't use your car, and the fewer cars on the road, the fewer traffic jams. And cars in traffic jams produce three times more CO2than cars traveling at speed. Cycling also makes you healthy and less likely to go to hospital. So maybe it's time for us all to start making some changes. Pass me a banana and a pint of local beer, please. Where can we probably read this passage? A) In a science fiction story.

Conduct market research: It's crucial for Jesse to investigate and understand the market in which they plan to operate. This entails analyzing target demographics, identifying consumer needs, and studying competitors. Armed with this data, Jesse can tailor their business to address existing gaps and target their ideal customers more effectively. 2. Develop a business plan: A well-structured business plan outlines the strategy, goals, and financial projections for Jesse's business. This document proves invaluable when seeking investment or loans and acts as a roadmap for business growth. 3. Legal structure and permits: Jesse must decide on the appropriate legal structure for their business, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. This decision can have significant tax and legal implications, so it's critical to research which option best suits the business. Additionally, securing the necessary licenses and permits is crucial to operate legally. 4. Financing: As suggested, getting cash is a vital step before launching a business. Jesse can look for various sources of funding, including personal savings, loans, angel investors, and grants. A strong business plan and financial projections will improve their chances of securing these funds. 5. Brand identity: Establishing a cohesive brand identity helps convey the business's message, ideals, and value proposition to potential customers. Jesse should consider elements such as the name, logo, color scheme, and tone of voice when crafting their business's image. 6.

Jesse should adopt various marketing channels such as social media, local newspapers, business directories, and promotional events to increase brand visibility and draw in customers. 7.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: listen to preachers who deny miracles B: become a strong prayer warrior C: go to Sunday school for the 1st time Answer:","response":"C: go to Sunday school for the 1st time None of the given options seems to be the most relevant or best answer to the question according to the context. However, out of the three choices, Option C: \\"go to Sunday school for the 1st time\\" seems to be the most appropriate answer to the question as it potentially introduces Carson to the religious aspect or at least religious themes that might be relevant to the context. Option A, \\"listening to preachers who deny miracles,\\" would likely discourage Carson from attempting to raise a dog from the dead, since the preachers do not believe in miracles. Therefore, this option does not align with the context and the desired outcome. Option B, \\"becoming a strong prayer warrior,\\" might suggest that Carson needs to increase his prayer skills in order to raise the dog from the dead, but this choice leaves out one important thing - learning about the concept of miracle and why it could happen. By attending Sunday school, Carson would likely learn biblical stories, various teachings, and values, which could introduce him to the possibility of miracles. Additionally, the context mentions raising a dog from the dead - an action which requires a significant leap of faith, belief in miracles, and possibly supernatural abilities. Attending Sunday school for the first time could expose Carson to faith-building stories and teachings that might inspire him to attempt something as miraculous as raising a dog from the dead. Although attending Sunday school for the first time is far from a guarantee that Carson will be able to perform such a miracle, it is the option that best aligns with the context. The exposure to faith-based teachings and discussions that occur in Sunday school could increase Carson's awareness of miracles and the power of faith, possibly enabling him to take on the challenging task of raising a dog from the dead."},{"question":"Please add spaces between words: Contributeevenmorewholegrains,vegetablesandfruitstoyourdiet.","response":"Here is the sentence with appropriate spaces between words: Contribute even more whole grains, vegetables and fruits to your diet.

The speaker B clearly states that they \\"don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.\\" For a more detailed and long analysis of the context given in the conversation, let's break down the points addressed by speaker A and B: Speaker A asks, \\"How do you feel about that?\\", prompting Speaker B to share their perspective on a certain issue, presumably related to the government or the Soviet Union. In response, Speaker B conveys: 1. They do not know much about the government. Therefore, the speaker admits a lack of expertise or knowledge regarding the topic. 2. They do not consider the people to be a threat. By addressing the people, Speaker B implies they hold a distinction between the people's actions and the government. Moreover, the speaker expresses trust or confidence in the people; they are not perceived as dangerous or harmful. 3. The remark that they \\"don't really feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore\\" suggests that Speaker B believes the potential danger from the Soviet Union has either reduced or disappeared. This statement indicates their standpoint on the Soviet Union's impact in the current context. Using this information, it is evident that the next sentence, \\"the Soviet Union itself is a threat still,\\" contradicts the statement expressed by Speaker B. The original text supports the idea that the Soviet Union is no longer viewed as a threat, while the following sentence suggests the opposite. To preserve the logical flow of the conversation, the next sentence should not contradict Speaker B's opinion and should align with the belief that the Soviet Union is not a threat."},{"question":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Step 3: Calculate the probability of exactly 3 rainy days - There are 4 possible ways to have exactly 3 rainy days: RRRN, RRNR, RNRR, and NRRR (where 'R' represents a rainy day and 'N' represents a non-rainy day). - The probability of each of these cases happening is (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1, which equals 1/16. - Since there are 4 such possibilities, add up their probabilities: 4 * (1/16). Step 4: Find the correct answer choice The calculated probability is 4 * (1/16) = 1/4. The answer is: a) 1/4"},{"question":"Q:Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

A: Introduced - This option does not explain why Ludwig didn't speak the language well. B: Foreigner - This option indicates that Ludwig came from a different country, which could explain his lack of English proficiency. C: Alien - This option is generally used for extraterrestrial beings, not a person who doesn't speak English well. D: Immigrant - This option implies that Ludwig moved from another country, which could explain his lack of English proficiency. However, not all immigrants struggle with the language.

You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What was the name of one of the students? Options: A. not enough information B. John. C. Jill. D. Joseph. Answer:","response":"A. not enough information"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the below conversation. W: Tell me, Jack. Do you look through the Web much?

Rival magician Alfred Borden, in disguise, sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap door and into a waiting water tank, where Borden watches him drown. At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingÃ©nieur, John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads. In flashback, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, alongside ingÃ©nieur John Cutter and assistant Julia, who is also Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank, from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a more secure, yet difficult knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, infuriating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden. Borden launches a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingÃ©nieur, Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who gives birth to their daughter, Jess.

Movie title: Imprint Movie plot: Christopher (Billy Drago), a Victorian era American journalist, is traveling through Japan looking for Komomo (Itô), a lost girlfriend whom he had promised to rescue from prostitution and bring to America. He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums she killed herself in shame and torment.Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth. The girl starts again, in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist.

Again she tells of being sold into prostitution, but gives a new version...

In this case, the given sentence is: \\"art film\\" Given the limited information available, it would be inaccurate to label this statement with a clear sentiment. The term \\"art film\\" generally refers to a particular type of movie that is characterized by its unique style, content, and vision, often prioritizing artistic expression and visual storytelling over mainstream appeal. If the movie in question is, indeed, an art film, then this statement could be seen as a neutral descriptor, simply providing factual information about the movie's genre. However, if the reviewer's intention was to praise the movie for its artistic qualities, this statement could be perceived as positive. On the other hand, if the reviewer dislikes art films and is using the term as a criticism, it could be seen as negative. To better understand the sentiment behind this statement, it would be helpful to have more context or additional information about the reviewer's perspective. For the effective evaluation of a movie review, it's essential to consider the reviewer's opinions, specific details about the film, and overall tone of the review."},{"question":"Come up with a question and stream of consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: crisp","response":"Question: What attribute of a freshly made French fry would you describe as its most appealing characteristic? Stream of consciousness reasoning: When I think about freshly made French fries, the first thing that comes to mind is their taste. But when you dig deeper, the most appealing characteristic would be their texture. There are several textures one might consider for French fries, such as their soft interior or the thin layer of salt on their surface. But the most important aspect is the outer part of the fry, the part that makes the first impression when you bite into it. It's the contrast between the soft inside and the exterior that contributes to their appeal. Therefore, the word \\"crisp\\" perfectly describes the most appealing characteristic of a freshly made French fry."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? great fun , Available choices: 1. negative; 2. positive;","response":"The correct answer is: 2. positive The sentiment of the sentence \\"great fun\\" is positive because \\"great\\" is a positive word that shows something is very good or enjoyable, and \\"fun\\" means you are having a good time and enjoying yourself. The other choice, 1. negative, is not correct because there are no negative words or feelings in the sentence."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? tiresome ugliness","response":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"tiresome ugliness\\" is negative. The two words used in this sentence both suggest a disapproving and unfavorable view of the film. The word \\"tiresome\\" implies that the movie is wearying or exhausting to watch, meaning that it fails to engage viewers, might be repetitive, or could be filled with unnecessary and drawn-out scenes. It suggests that the movie does not hold the audiences' interest and may be disliked for its lack of entertainment value. The word \\"ugliness\\" refers to an unpleasant visual or thematic aspect of the film. \\"Ugliness\\" can mean that the movie features distasteful or repulsive imagery, which can detract from viewers' overall enjoyment. Alternatively, it might imply that the thematic content of the movie is immoral, offensive, or objectionable in some way. This could affect the perception of the film and create a negative reaction from the audience. In conclusion, the sentiment of the phrase \\"tiresome ugliness\\" is negative, as it highlights two flaws in the movie – one relating to its ability to maintain viewers' interest, and the other to its visual or thematic content. As a result, the audience might be more likely to avoid or dislike this film."},{"question":"Do these questions have the same meaning? Which Nobel prize winner you like? And why?

The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a restraining order against each other. With the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, 1983, he fatally drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \\"rock bands\\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \\"the wrong element\\", who would steal from attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, \\"...obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element.\\" Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, \\"They're my friends and I like their music\\". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had \\"shot himself in the foot\\". The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. On July 4, 1985, the group played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington. They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert. In 1985, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of \\"California Girls\\". \\"Getcha Back\\", released from the album, gave the group a No. 26 single in the U.S. Following this, the group put out \\"Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue\\" (U.S., No. 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\" (U.S., No. 57). In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song \\"Wipe Out\\" and filming a music video. It was a No. 12 single in the US and a No. 2 rank in the UK. Was he with the band when he died?","response":"Dennis Wilson, one of the founding members of The Beach Boys, was technically still a member of the band at the time of his death on December 28, 1983. However, due to his struggles with alcoholism and escalating tensions with other band members, particularly Mike Love, he was given an ultimatum to check into rehab or face being banned from performing live with the band. Dennis checked into rehab in an attempt to get sober, but he ultimately drowned while diving from a friend's boat in Marina del Rey. Although Dennis Wilson was going through a challenging time with the band and facing the possibility of being banned from performing live with them, he had not officially left or been removed from The Beach Boys when he passed away."},{"question":"Question: Given the following passage \\"In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\", answer the following question.

For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \\"In the Confucian mindset, the right thing to do is to share the burden, which is the sense of collective responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,\\" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU). In contrast, local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousand, but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups, job cuts will probably be less severe. Japan's jobless rate was 4 percent in September, up from 3.8 percent in January, while Hong Kong's was flat at 3.4 percent. But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6.3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January. Experts say that while there are noticeable differences in labor practices in East and West, the gap will narrow as more firms become more multinational and competition forces firms to adopt the best practices of rivals from abroad. Question: In which company can we infer the job cuts will be probably the most severe? Yes or no, is the answer \\"A local American group.\\"? Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer is \\"A local American group.\\" We can infer that job cuts will be probably the most severe in local Western companies like General Motors and Goldman Sachs."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Best Camera ever!\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

For moments of bad luck, Hungarians still say: \\"more was lost at Mohács\\" . Hungarians view Mohács as marking the end of an independent and powerful European nation. Whilst Mohács was a decisive loss, it was the aftermath that truly put an end to independent Hungary. The ensuing two hundred years of near constant warfare between the two empires, Habsburg and Ottoman, turned Hungary into a perpetual battlefield. The countryside was regularly ravaged by armies moving back and forth, in turn devastating the population. Only in the 19th century would Hungary regain some degree of autonomy, with full independence coming only after the First World War; however, the Treaty of Trianon awarded much of its former land to other states , and Hungary has never regained its former political power. In the 464 years from 1525 to 1989, Hungary spent the vast majority of the time under the direct or indirect domination of a foreign power. These foreign powers were, successively, the Ottoman Empire , the Holy Roman Empire , the Austrian Empire , and the Soviet Union ; furthermore, between 1867 and 1918 Hungary was widely considered the \\"junior\\" partner in the Austro-Hungarian Empire: autonomy was granted, but stopped well short of independence. The battlefield, beside the village of Sátorhely, became an official national historical memorial site in 1976 on the 450th anniversary of the battle. The memorial was designed by architect György Vadász. A new reception hall and exhibition building, also designed by Vadász and partially funded by the European Union, was completed in 2011.

Introduced in 1955, Kermit serves as the straight man protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, as well as in other television series, films, specials, and public service announcements through the years. Henson originally performed Kermit until his death in 1990; Steve Whitmire performed Kermit from that time up until his dismissal from the role in 2016. Jim Henson originated the character in 1955 on his local television series, Sam and Friends. Brian Henson described his father's performance as Kermit as \\"coming out of his own personality--was a wry intelligence, a little bit of a naughtiness, but Kermit always loved everyone around and also loved a good prank.\\" He continued to perform the character until his death in 1990. Henson's last known performance as Kermit was for an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show to promote The Muppets at Walt Disney World. Henson died twelve days after that appearance. Following Henson's death, veteran Muppet performer Steve Whitmire was named Kermit's new performer. In 2017, Whitmire seemed to imply in a blog post that Jim Henson had asked him to assume the role before he died, though Jim's daughter Cheryl Henson claimed Brian had selected him after Jim's death. Whitmire's first public performance as Kermit was at the end of the television special The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson in 1990. He remained Kermit's principal performer until 2016. Disney announced that Matt Vogel would be taking over as the performer and voice for Kermit on July 10, 2017. Whitmire later revealed that he had not chosen to voluntarily leave the role, but rather, had been recast by Muppet Studios in October 2016. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter later in July 2017, Whitmire elaborated he was fired for two reasons: long-term creative disagreements over Kermit's characterization and prolonged labor union negotiations that delayed his involvement in Muppet-related productions. For a brief demonstration at MuppetFest (a 2001 Muppet fan convention), Muppet performer John Kennedy performed Kermit opposite Whitmire's performance of young Kermit (from Kermit's Swamp Years). Kennedy also performed Kermit for Muppets Ahoy!, a 2006 Disney Cruise Line stage show (though Whitmire performed Kermit for the first few shows). Muppet performer Artie Esposito briefly performed Kermit in 2009 for a few personal appearances (an appearance on America's Got Talent, an appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards, and at the 2009 D23 Expo with Rowlf the Dog as part of a tribute to Jim Henson). Voice actor Frank Welker provided the voice of Baby Kermit on the animated Saturday morning cartoon, Muppet Babies. He also provided the voice of an adult Kermit for a short-lived spin-off, Little Muppet Monsters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many years had he been the performer?","response":"Steve Whitmire had been the performer of Kermit the Frog from 1990 until his dismissal from the role in 2016, which is a total of 26 years."},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires. I am facing a new situation today: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A. But the other house didn't have short circuit. He labeled that as case B. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, case A or case B? Answer:","response":"The situation where the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other directly, bypassing any appliance or resistor, would be case A. Case A is the one in which Greg, the electrical engineer, identified a short circuit. A short circuit as determined by the information provided in your background article, is a condition that arises when the wire bringing the current in comes into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire. This implies that the wires carrying in and out current are touching directly to each other. When this happens, all or some of the resistance placed in the circuit to limit the amount of current, such as appliances or other resistors, is circumvented. Consequently, the voltage can push a massive current through these wires without any limit. A situation that can pose a safety risk due to the production of excess heat or even an electric arc, leading potentially to electrical fires. Therefore, in case A when Greg noted a short circuit in one of the homes, the wires carrying in and out current would have been in direct contact with each other. On the other hand, in case B, the home without a short circuit, these electrical wires were effectively separated, allowing the current to safely flow through the appliances or other resistors, effectively managing the application of voltage and managing the current safety. Therefore, short circuit would not occur in case B. Greg's work as an electrical engineer helps to ensure that the wiring of homes is safe and complies with standards that seek to limit issues like short circuits. His identification of a short circuit in case A should bring about maintenance and remediation work to restore safety and proper electrical flow in the home's wiring."},{"question":"Principal Mark Bensley refused two Muslim women from completing their work placement at Redlands College in Queensland. A Christian school principal has come under fire from parents and members of the public after he turned away two Muslim women who wore hijabs on their first day as student teachers. People took to social media to express their disappointment at Principal Mark Bensley's decision. Redlands College parent Jennie Duke wrote she was 'so very sad' her daughter attended the school and her university sent student teachers there, The Courier Mail reported. Others re-branded Redlands College as 'Redneck College' and questioned Mr Bentley's Christian faith. 'It’s not very \\"Christian like\\" for a Christian school to tell student teachers that they are not welcome to teach and learn because they wear a hijab,' a reader wrote on the newspaper's website. 'Shame on you Redlands College. This could have been a very good way to show Christian love and acceptance.' The two Muslim women were allocated positions to start their work placement at Redlands College, as they are in their final year of studying teaching at university. But Mr Bensley didn't allow the women to go ahead with their placement, and justified his decision in the college newsletter on Tuesday, claiming he acted inside his duty of care, according to the paper. 'I have a duty of care to ensure that those teaching at the College are actively supporting the Christian principles, practices and beliefs of the College,' he wrote. He continued by writing that he viewed the wearing of the hijab to be in direct opposition to the principles which the college upholds. Mr Bensley said he respected the two women's right to wear the hijab but felt it was inappropriate at his school, and had them transferred to another school to complete their placement. In a statement to the publication, Redlands College said that they were accepting and loving of all people from all cultures and religions. A statement from the Christian College denied any wrongdoing and said they are not aware the student teachers had any opposition to being transferred. 'We are not aware that they [student teachers] had any concerns, and it is our understanding that all parties came to a mutual agreement for the benefit of all,' the school said. Redlands also claimed that they would not hide their Christian values and were there to provide for the families seeking a Christian education. A spokesperson for the school said that the decision had nothing to do with intolerance and they condemn any form of that behavior. The Islamic community are disappointed with the decision while a Reverend said it goes against fundamental Christian beliefs. According to Section 25 of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991, employers are allowed to enforce a 'genuine occupational requirement that workers act in a way that is consistent with the religious beliefs of the school'. However, the move has upset many, including the Muslim community with the Islamic College of Brisbane principal saying the decision was a matter of great concern. Reverend Anneli Sinnko told the Courier Mail that he also disagreed with it, and that the actions are a direct contradiction of the foundations of Christianity.

From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians., can you guess it ?

This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture.

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - The United States Maritime Service (USMS) was established in 1938 under the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. The mission of the organization is to train people to become officers and crewmembers on merchant ships that form the United States Merchant Marine per Title 46 U.S. Code 51701. Heavily utilized during World War II, the USMS has since been largely dissolved and/or absorbed into other federal departments, but its commissioned officers continue to function as administrators and instructors at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the several maritime academies. - The United States Maritime Commission (MARCOM) was an independent executive agency of the U.S. federal government that was created by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, passed by Congress on June 29, 1936, and replaced the United States Shipping Board which had existed since World War I. It was intended to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred modern merchant cargo ships to replace the World War I vintage vessels that comprised the bulk of the United States Merchant Marine, and to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act to offset the cost differential between building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. It also formed the United States Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship's officers to man the new fleet. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - USNS Kingsport ( T - AG - 164 ) was built as SS Kingsport Victory , a United States Maritime Commission VC2 - S - AP3 ( Victory ) type cargo ship . During the closing days of World War II the ship was operated by the American Hawaiian Steamship Company under an agreement with the War Shipping Administration . After a period of layup the ship was operated as USAT Kingsport Victory by the Army under bareboat charter effective 8 July 1948 . When Army transports were transferred to the Navy 's Navy 's Military Sea Transportation Service the ship continued as a cargo transport as USNS Kingsport Victory ( T - AK - 239 ) . On 14 November 1961 , after conversion into the first satellite communication ship , the ship was renamed Kingsport , preclassifird as a general auxiliary , and operated as USNS Kingsport ( T - AG - 164 ) . Assigned to duty supporting the U.S. Army Satellite Communications Agency USNS Kingsport was further modified and , in August 1963 while in Lagos harbor , transmitted the first satellite voice call between heads of state when John F. Kennedy and Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard Kingsport spoke in a two - way call . A demonstration of transmission of oceanographic data was made between a research vessel off Africa via the ship and satellite to Washington . The first air to ship satellite communication took place when Navy aircraft off Virginia established voice communication with Kingsport which was off Morocco . Further satellite communications work took place in the Pacific and Indian Oceans . Kingsport then supported Project Gemini into March 1966 . After conversion from satellite configuration , particularly removal of the large and very visible dome , Kingsport was engaged in acoustic work for the Navy supporting undersea surveillance programs . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land (January 8, 1879 November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design. Notable assignments included serving as Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s, and as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II. - The War Shipping Administration (WSA) was a World War II emergency war agency of the US government, tasked to purchase and operate the civilian shipping tonnage the US needed for fighting the war.

Land who continued as head of the Maritime Commission while also heading the WSA. - The United States Merchant Marine refers to either United States civilian mariners, or to U.S. civilian and federally owned merchant vessels. Both the civilian mariners, and the merchant vessels, are managed by a combination of the government and private sectors, and engage in commerce or transportation of goods and services in and out of the navigable waters of the United States. The Merchant Marine primarily transports cargo and passengers during peacetime; in times of war, the Merchant Marine can be an auxiliary to the United States Navy, and can be called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel for the military. Merchant Marine officers may also be commissioned as military officers by the Department of Defense. This is commonly achieved by commissioning unlimited tonnage Merchant Marine officers as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Naval Reserves. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier.

The revolution was marked by widespread violence, and the guillotine became a symbol of its brutality. Below are some of the most well-known individuals who were executed during this tumultuous period: 1. King Louis XVI: Louis XVI was the last king of France before the fall of the monarchy during the French Revolution. He was convicted of high treason and executed by guillotine on January 21, 1793. His execution marked a significant turning point in the revolution, as it effectively ended France's centuries-long monarchy and paved the way for the radical phase of the revolution. 2. Marie Antoinette: Marie Antoinette was the wife of King Louis XVI and the last Queen of France. She became a symbol of the monarchy's excesses and was accused of treason and collusion with foreign powers. She was convicted and executed by guillotine on October 16, 1793, nine months after her husband's execution. 3. Maximilien Robespierre: Robespierre was a prominent leader of the French Revolution and the architect of the Reign of Terror, a period of extreme violence and political repression. Ironically, he would eventually become a victim of the very terror he helped create. He was arrested on July 27, 1794, and executed without trial alongside 21 of his supporters on July 28, 1794. 4. Georges Danton: Danton was a leading figure in the early stages of the French Revolution and served as the first President of the Committee of Public Safety. However, he later fell out of favor due to his opposition to the Reign of Terror. He was arrested, tried for conspiracy and corruption, and executed by guillotine on April 5, 1794. 5. Camille Desmoulins: Desmoulins was a journalist and politician who played a significant role in the French Revolution. He was a close friend of Robespierre and Danton and supported their radical policies. However, his opposition to the Reign of Terror contributed to his downfall. He was arrested, tried, and executed by guillotine on April 5, 1794, alongside Danton and other members of their political faction. 6. Charlotte Corday: Corday was a Girondin sympathizer who assassinated radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat in his bathtub on July 13, 1793. She believed that by killing Marat, she could help end the Reign of Terror. She was quickly arrested and tried for the crime, and she was executed by guillotine on July 17, 1793. These are just a few examples of prominent figures who were executed during the French Revolution. The period was marked by widespread fear, suspicion, and violence, which led to the deaths of thousands of individuals, both famous and ordinary. The guillotine came to symbolize the harsh and arbitrary nature of revolutionary justice during this tumultuous time."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

The origin of a number of \\"kennings\\" is given; then Bragi delivers a systematic list of \\"kennings\\" for various people, places and things. He then goes on to discuss poetic language in some detail, in particular \\"heiti\\", the concept of poetical words which are non-periphrastic (like \\"steed\\" for \\"horse\\"), and again systematises these. This in a way forms an early form of poetic thesaurus. - Skoglar Toste or Skoglar Tosti ( there are several variations ) was a legendary chieftain from the Swedish province of West Götaland . His name ( skoglar , skauglar or skagul ) was reportedly due to his experience in battle . Toste is mentioned in several sagas , most notable in Heimskringla . According to Snorri Sturluson , he was the father of Sigrid the Haughty . For some time he gave refuge to Harald Grenske , who later came back to woo Sigrid , only to be killed by her for his persistence . According to the sagas , Skagul Toste was also the father of Ulf Tostesson , father of Ragnvald Ulfsson and grandfather of Stenkil who became the King of Sweden in 1060 . Toste is said to have collected great riches when he demanded danegeld as he led a Viking army to England in 970 . At Vallentuna , near Stockholm , the runestone of Orkesta ( U 344 ) reads : in ulfr hafir onklati - Stenkil (Old Norse: Steinkell) was a King of Sweden who ruled c. 1060 until 1066. He succeeded Emund the Old and became the first king from the House of Stenkil. He was not from Uppsala, but probably from Västergötland and related to the previous dynasty by marriage to Emund's daughter. - Västergötland, also known as West Gothland or the Latinized version Westrogothia in older literature, is one of the 25 traditional non-administrative provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish), situated in the southwest of Sweden. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Sigrid the Haughty, also known as Sigríð Storråda, is a queen appearing in Norse sagas as wife, first of Eric the Victorious of Sweden, then Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. Sigrid appears in many sagas composed generations after the events they describe, but there is no reliable evidence as to her existence as they describe her. The figure of Sigrid appears mainly in late Icelandic sagas, while more contemporary sources such as Thietmar of Merseburg and Adam of Bremen instead claim that Sweyn was married to a Polish princess, identified as witosawa. Snorri Sturlason gives conflicting information and in one place says that Sweyn was married to Sigrid and in another that he was married to a Gunhild of Wenden. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland.

He was elected twice as lawspeaker at the Icelandic parliament, the Althing. He was the author of the \\"Prose Edda\\" or \\"Younger Edda\\", which consists of \\"Gylfaginning\\" (\\"the fooling of Gylfi\\"), a narrative of Norse mythology, the \\"Skáldskaparmál\\", a book of poetic language, and the \\"Háttatal\\", a list of verse forms. He was also the author of the \\"Heimskringla\\", a history of the Norwegian kings that begins with legendary material in \\"Ynglinga saga\\" and moves through to early medieval Scandinavian history. For stylistic and methodological reasons, Snorri is often taken to be the author of \\"Egil's saga\\". - The Alþingi (anglicised as or ) is the national parliament of Iceland. It is one of the oldest extant parliamentary institutions in the world. The Althing was founded in 930 at , the \\"assembly fields\\" or \\"Parliament fields\\", situated approximately east of what later became the country's capital, Reykjavík.

It is generally referred to as Egla by Icelandic scholars. The saga is the only source of information on the exploits of Egill whose life is not historically recorded. Stylistic and other similarities between \\"Egil's Saga\\" and \\"Heimskringla\\" have led many scholars to believe that they were the work of the same author, Snorri Sturluson. - The Háttatal (\\"conversation of meters\\"; c. 20,000 words) is the last section of the \\"Prose Edda\\" composed by the Icelandic poet, politician, and historian Snorri Sturluson. Using, for the most part, his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, and often notes that \\"the older poets did not always\\" follow his rules. - Emund the Old or Edmund (Swedish: \\"Emund den gamle\\", Old Swedish: \\"Æmunðær gamlæ\\", \\"Æmunðær gammal\\", \\"Æmunðær slemæ\\") was King of Sweden from 1050 to 1060. - Uppsala (older spelling \\"Upsala\\") is the capital of Uppsala County and the fourth largest city of Sweden, after Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.

Two of Thietmar's great-grandfathers, both referred to Liuthar, were the Saxon nobles Lothar II, Count of Stade, and Lothar I, Count of Walbeck. They were both killed fighting the Slavs at the Battle of Lenzen. - Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: \\"Sveinn Tjúguskegg\\"; Danish: \\"Svend Tveskæg\\"; 960 3 February 1014) was king of Denmark, England, and parts of Norway. His name appears as Swegen in the \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\". He was the son of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, and the father of Cnut the Great. - Ragnvald Ulfsson the Old (beginning 11th century) was a jarl of Västergötland or Östergötland, and married to a sister of Olav Tryggvason. - Ynglinga saga is a legendary saga, originally written in Old Norse by the Icelandic poet and historian Snorri Sturluson about 1225. It is the first section of his \\"Heimskringla\\". It was first translated into English and published in 1844 by Samuel Laing. - Heimskringla is the best known of the Old Norse kings' sagas. It was written in Old Norse in Iceland by the poet and historian Snorri Sturluson (1178/791241) ca. 1230. The name \\"Heimskringla\\" was first used in the 17th century, derived from the first two words of one of the manuscripts (\\"kringla heimsins\\" - \\"the circle of the world\\"). - Eric the Victorious (Old Norse: \\"Eiríkr inn sigrsæli\\", Modern Swedish: \\"Erik Segersäll\\") (c. 945? c. 995) was the first Swedish king (c. 970995) about whom anything definite is known. Whether he actually qualifies as King of Sweden has been debated, as his son Olof Skötkonung was the first ruler documented to have been accepted both by the Svear around Lake Mälaren and by the Götar around Lake Vättern. - Gunhilda of Wenden was a semi-legendary Polish or other Slavic princess and Danish Viking age queen consort, the supposed spouse of 10th-century King Sweyn I of Denmark (9861014). - The Prose Edda, also known as the Younger Edda, Snorri's Edda or, historically, simply as Edda, is an Old Norse work of literature written in Iceland in the early 13th century. The work is often assumed to have been written, or at least compiled, by the Icelandic scholar and historian Snorri Sturluson around the year 1220. - Ulf Tostesson was a jarl and the son of the legendary Viking Skogul Toste.

(2) David Foster called her rehearsal performance \`\` very nice '' , and Andrea Bocelli called her voice spectacular . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","response":"While these two sentences may initially appear to convey the same general idea, they do not mean exactly the same thing. The discrepancies between the two sentences can be seen when we closely examine the attributes, the subjects, and the actions involved. In Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli called her sample performance \\"very nice.\\" - David Foster called her voice spectacular. In Sentence 2: - David Foster called her rehearsal performance \\"very nice.\\" - Andrea Bocelli called her voice spectacular. Now, let's break down the differences between the two sentences: 1. Difference in Subjects: Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli comments on the sample performance. - David Foster comments on her voice. Sentence 2: - David Foster comments on the rehearsal performance. - Andrea Bocelli comments on her voice. In Sentence 1, Andrea Bocelli is commenting on the sample performance, while David Foster is commenting on her voice. In contrast, Sentence 2 has David Foster commenting on the rehearsal performance, while Andrea Bocelli is focusing on her voice. Although Bocelli comments on her voice in both scenarios, the context differs as David Foster evaluates separate aspects of her performances. 2. Difference in Attributes: Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli: sample performance. - David Foster: her voice. Sentence 2: - David Foster: rehearsal performance. - Andrea Bocelli: her voice. Here, we notice that Andrea Bocelli is evaluating a sample performance in Sentence 1 and David Foster is assessing a rehearsal performance in Sentence 2. These two types of performances could possess distinct characteristics, and the feedback might not be interchangeable or identical. 3. Difference in Actions: Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli: called the sample performance \\"very nice.\\" - David Foster: called her voice spectacular. Sentence 2: - David Foster: called the rehearsal performance \\"very nice.\\" - Andrea Bocelli: called her voice spectacular. While both sentences include the phrase \\"called her voice spectacular,\\" the adjectives used to describe her performances differ. In Sentence 1, Andrea Bocelli describes the sample performance as \\"very nice,\\" while David Foster uses the same adjective for the rehearsal performance in Sentence 2. This difference implies that the feedback for the performances in each sentence may not be entirely the same. In conclusion, although Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 both highlight Andrea Bocelli and David Foster providing feedback on a performance, the nuances that differentiate the subjects, attributes, and actions involved make the two sentences distinct in their meanings."},{"question":"Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = The Vaults, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, priceRange = high, familyFriendly = yes Sentence:","response":"The Vaults is a high-end, family-friendly Italian restaurant that offers a premium culinary experience, catering to both young and old alike with their delectable menu and warm, inviting atmosphere, making it the perfect destination for patrons seeking both quality food and an enjoyable ambiance."},{"question":"Q:Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's? Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. A:","response":"Based on the information provided, Jeff's soil has more toxic compounds than Brandon's. This is because Jeff's soil is hypoxic, which means it has low oxygen levels. In hypoxic soils, nitrification is inhibited, and toxic compounds are formed as anaerobic bacteria use alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, manganese, and sulfate. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands, and the chemical consequences of hypoxia include the formation of toxic compounds and precipitation of metal ions like iron and manganese. On the other hand, Brandon's soil is not hypoxic, implying that his soil has normal oxygen levels and does not have the same chemical consequences as Jeff's hypoxic soil."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Sentence 2: Robert McKee professed his admiration of Citizen Kane. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"The first sentence implies that Robert McKee does not hold Citizen Kane and Orson Welles in high esteem. It mentions that McKee has reserved \\"a special place in hell\\" for the film and its director, even going as far as to criticize Welles for upstaging his own narrative. From this statement, we can infer that McKee disapproves of the way Citizen Kane was made and the approach taken by its creator. However, the second sentence states that Robert McKee professed his admiration for Citizen Kane. This assertion appears contradictory to the first sentence, as it suggests that McKee has a positive opinion about the film. Considering both sentences, it is difficult to reconcile the discrepancy in McKee's opinions. It is possible that these statements were made in different contexts or time periods, with McKee's feelings towards Citizen Kane changing over time. However, based solely on the information provided, the second sentence does not seem to be true if we accept the first sentence as accurate. One potential explanation for the contradiction is that McKee could have a complex opinion about Citizen Kane – admiring some aspects of the film while also highly disapproving of others. In this case, both sentences could hold some truth, albeit from different perspectives on McKee's overall viewpoint. It is important to note that without further context or direct quotes from McKee, we cannot definitively determine his stance on Citizen Kane. We could only infer his opinions based on the provided information, which is itself contradictory.

When asked his response to those, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who say there was no vital U.S. interest at stake when the Libya intervention began, McCain said: “Our interests are our values” and “our values are that we don’t want people needlessly slaughtered by the thousands,” as Moammar Gaddafi seemed to threaten to do, “if we can prevent such activity.” Under the McCain Doctrine, America’s military would have just begun to fight, and would never stop. Americans are, however, war weary — which is a good thing: What kind of people would they be if they were not? U.S. involvement in the Second World War lasted 1,346 days. U.S. fighting in Afghanistan reached that milestone six years ago (June 14, 2005). America is fighting there, in Iraq, in western Pakistan, in Yemen and in Libya. Where next? Under the McCain Doctrine, wherever U.S. “values” are affronted — and those who demur from this global crusade are isolationists, akin to those who, 70 years ago, thought broad oceans and placid neighbors guaranteed America’s security from Hitler and Japan. Is Jim Webb an isolationist? Virginia’s Democratic senator, who was Ronald Reagan’s secretary of the Navy, discusses Libya with a trenchancy that befits a decorated Marine combat veteran (Vietnam) and that should shame reticent Republicans: “Was our country under attack, or under the threat of imminent attack? Was a clearly vital national interest at stake? Were we invoking the inherent right of self-defense as outlined in the United Nations charter? Were we called upon by treaty commitments to come to the aid of an ally? Were we responding in kind to an attack on our forces elsewhere, as we did in the 1986 raids in Libya after American soldiers had been killed in a disco in Berlin? Were we rescuing Americans in distress, as we did in Grenada in 1983? No, we were not.” McCain, however, says we must achieve regime change in Libya because if Gaddafi survives, he will try to “harm” America. This is always the last argument for pressing on with imprudent interventions (see Vietnam, circa 1969): We must continue fighting because we started fighting. Sen. Lindsey Graham — Sancho Panza to McCain’s Don Quixote — says “Congress should sort of shut up” about Libya. This ukase might make more sense if Congress had said anything institutionally about Libya. Although Barack Obama’s shifting reasons for the Libyan war are as risible as his denial that it is a war, some conservatives seem to regard it as “a splendid little war.” That was Ambassador John Hay’s description (in a letter to Theodore Roosevelt) of the Spanish-American War. McCain has frequently expressed admiration for TR, the only president who was an unvarnished imperialist (see Evan Thomas’s book “The War Lovers”). McCain’s bellicosity is, however, at least less obnoxious than TR’s, which represented a toxic strain of early 20th-century progressivism — a cocktail of racialism and political Darwinism. Regarding Libya, McCain on Sunday said, “I wonder what Ronald Reagan would be saying today.” Wondering is speculation; we know this: When a terrorist attack that killed 241 Marines and other troops taught Reagan the folly of deploying them at Beirut airport with a vague mission and dangerous rules of engagement, he was strong enough to reverse this intervention in a civil war. Would that he had heeded a freshman congressman from Arizona who opposed the House resolution endorsing the intervention. But, then, the McCain of 1983 was, by the standards of the McCain of 2011, an isolationist. Summary:","response":"The article discusses the different opinions on the US intervention in Libya. Senator John McCain argues that the US must achieve regime change in Libya due to the potential harm Gaddafi could cause to America. He challenges those who do not support intervention by calling them isolationists. However, Senator Jim Webb raises questions about whether the US had justifiable reasons to intervene in Libya in the first place. The article also points out that while some conservatives supported the war in Libya, others criticized it as an imprudent intervention."},{"question":"Question: what color is the eiffel tower?

Answer the above question based on the context below: At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars.

Title: Raging Bull Movie plot: In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first.

Seizures can manifest in different forms, ranging from mild to severe. One type of epilepsy that is specifically triggered by visual stimuli is called Photosensitive Epilepsy. In this type of epilepsy, seizures occur when a person is exposed to certain visual stimuli, such as flashing lights or specific patterns. Here is the chain-of-thought: 1. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. 2. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. 3. Photosensitive Epilepsy is a type of epilepsy where seizures are triggered by visual stimuli. 4. Common visual triggers for Photosensitive Epilepsy include flashing lights, rapidly changing images, and certain patterns. 5. Therefore, people suffering from epilepsy, particularly Photosensitive Epilepsy, may have seizures triggered by visual phenomena."},{"question":"OK. You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"I went to the park for a hike.\\" - Sentence B: \\"I went to the mall for a hike.\\"","response":"Ultimately, the sentence that doesn't make sense here is Sentence B: \\"I went to the mall for a hike.\\" Reasoning: - Sentence A: \\"I went to the park for a hike.\\" This sentence makes sense because going to the park for a hike is a plausible and common activity. Parks often have trails, green spaces, and natural landscapes, which are suitable environments for hiking. - Sentence B: \\"I went to the mall for a hike.\\" This sentence doesn't make sense because going to the mall for a hike is not a reasonable or typical activity. Malls are primarily commercial establishments with shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. While one can walk around the mall for exercise, it is not a place where people generally go for a hike, as hiking typically implies walking in a natural setting or on specific trails."},{"question":"The Sand Pebbles - The Sand Pebbles is a 1962 novel by American author Richard McKenna about a Yangtze River gunboat and its crew in 1926.

Given a choice of categories company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, the text refers to which one? Answer:","response":"The text refers to a \\"written work.\\""},{"question":"Information: - The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. In some ways, calling it a \\"joint\\" (singular) is a misnomer, since the lumbosacral junction includes a disc between the lower lumbar vertebral body and the uppermost sacral vertebral body, as well as two lumbosacral facet joints (right and left zygapophysial joints). - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The cecum or caecum (plural ceca ; from the Latin \\"caecus\\" meaning blind) is an intraperitoneal pouch that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine. It is typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of the body as the appendix, to which it is joined). - In human anatomy, the thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm, is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases and air is drawn into the lungs. - An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. Their role as shock absorbers in the spine is crucial. - The pelvic inlet or superior aperture of the pelvis is a planar surface which defines the boundary between the pelvic cavity and the abdominal cavity (or, according to some authors, between two parts of the pelvic cavity, called lesser pelvis and greater pelvis). - The ascending colon is the part of the colon located between the cecum and the transverse colon. - The thorax or chest (from the Greek \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain. - In anatomy, the abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls. - The rectum (from the Latin \\" \\", meaning \\"straight intestine\\") is the final straight portion of the large intestine in some mammals, and the gut in others. The human rectum is about long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge. - The transverse colon is the longest and most movable part of the colon . It crosses the abdomen from the ascending colon at the hepatic or right colic flexure with a downward convexity to the descending colon where it curves sharply on itself beneath the lower end of the spleen forming the splenic or left colic flexure . In its course , it describes an arch , the concavity of which is directed backward and a little upward . Toward its splenic end there is often an abrupt U-shaped curve which may descend lower than the main curve . It is almost completely invested by peritoneum , and is connected to the inferior border of the pancreas by a large and wide duplicature of that membrane , the transverse mesocolon . It is in relation , by its upper surface , with the liver and gall - bladder , the greater curvature of the stomach , and the lower end of the spleen ; by its under surface , with the small intestine ; by its anterior surface , with the posterior layer of the greater omentum and the abdominal wall ; its posterior surface is in relation from right to left with the descending portion of the duodenum , the head of the pancreas , and some of the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum . The transverse colon absorbs water and salts . - The pubic symphysis or symphysis pubis is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting the superior rami of the left and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2 mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth. - The sigmoid colon (pelvic colon) is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. It forms a loop that averages about 35-40 cm in length. The loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma () or Latin letter S (thus \\"sigma\\" + \\"-oid\\"). This part of the colon normally lies within the pelvis, but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity. - The pelvic brim is the edge of the pelvic inlet. It is an approximately apple-shaped line passing through the prominence of the sacrum, the arcuate and pectineal lines, and the upper margin of the pubic symphysis. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys. - The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans and many other animals that contains many organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet , opening into the pelvis. - The descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum. - The spleen (from Greek \\"spln\\") is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - The cephalothorax, also called prosoma in some groups, is a tagma of various arthropods, comprising the head and the thorax fused together, as distinct from the abdomen behind. (The terms \\"prosoma\\" and \\"opisthosoma\\" are equivalent to \\"cephalothorax\\" and \\"abdomen\\" in some groups.) The word \\"cephalothorax\\" is derived from the Greek words for head and thorax . This fusion of the head and thorax is seen in chelicerates and crustaceans; in other groups, such as the Hexapoda (including insects), the head remains free of the thorax. In horseshoe crabs and many crustaceans, a hard shell called the carapace covers the cephalothorax. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. - The large intestine, or the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.

Mr Zuma is accused of an improper relationship with wealthy businessmen. He had tried to block the release of the report, but dropped his court bid on Wednesday. The president and leader of the governing African National Congress (ANC) has been dogged by corruption allegations for more than a decade, but has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Police fired water cannon to disperse protesters who marched on Mr Zuma's main office in Pretoria to demand his resignation. The 355-page report by former anti-corruption chief Thuli Madonsela is entitled \\"State of Capture\\" and is illustrated on its front page with a hand strung with puppet wires. Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas is quoted in the report as saying that businessman Ajay Gupta offered him 600m rand (44.6m; Â£36.2m) last year, \\"to be deposited in an account of his choice\\", if he accepted the post of finance minister. Mr Gupta also asked him if he had \\"a bag which he could use to receive and carry 600,000 rand in cash immediately\\", Mr Jonas alleged, adding that Mr Zuma's son, Duduzane, was present at the meeting. He was expected to remove key Treasury officials from their posts and advance the Gupta family's \\"business ambitions\\", Mr Jonas is quoted as saying. The businessman has not yet commented on the report, but has previously denied any wrongdoing. The Gupta family is close to President Zuma, and the two have been nicknamed by the opposition as the \\"Zuptas\\". After Mr Jonas rejected the alleged offer, little-known ANC MP Des van Rooyen was appointed finance minister. Ms Madonsela said she had obtained evidence, including telephone records, placing Mr Van Rooyen at the Gupta's family home on seven occasions, including the day before the appointment. Mr Zuma was forced to sack him four days later after South Africa's currency went into a tailspin. The report also contains allegations that: Opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Musi Maimane said state coffers were being \\"plundered\\" by \\"crooks\\", but the \\"good guys\\" were winning in the battle to safeguard the democracy which emerged in South Africa at the end of minority rule in 1994. There has not been any immediate reaction from Mr Zuma, who did not co-operate with the investigation, saying he had not been given enough time. This report is bad for President Zuma but certainly not as damning as opposition parties and many others had hoped when they went to court. The findings and subsequent remedial action seem to kick the can down the road. It says that the president should appoint a judicial commission of inquiry. This means that Mr Zuma would still occupy the highest office in the land for many months to come, as he slowly approaches the end of his second and last term. There is no doubt that should the inquiry recommend that Mr Zuma be censured, there would be grounds for impeachment. But that would present a political problem in the house of assembly because Mr Zuma's own party, the ANC, holds an overwhelming majority. The loyal MPs have overcome many attempts by the opposition to have a vote of no confidence in the president. Mr Zuma lives to fight another day but he must surely be nearing the last of his nine lives. An earlier statement from the president's office said the decision to abandon a court bid to block the report's release was made \\"in the interest of justice and speedy resolution of the matter\\". \\"The president will give consideration to the contents of the report in order to ascertain whether it should be a subject of a court challenge,\\" it said. Mr Zuma survived an impeachment vote earlier this year after South Africa's highest court upheld another finding of Ms Madonsela - that he had \\"unduly benefited\\" from government money used to upgrade his private home in the rural area of Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal province. Ms Madonsela stepped down as Public Protector at the end of her seven-year term last month. The Guptas in South Africa: Who are the Guptas?

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers were land owners. Bill owned 40 acres of forest, , with very well developed soil. His brother Rick owned 40 acres of grasslands, with a poor soil. Rick decided to sell his land. Answer this question please: Which brother owned a land which had lower amounts of fulvic acid? The answer is:","response":"Rick, the brother who owned the grasslands, had a land which had lower amounts of fulvic acid in its soil compared to Bill's forest land. To understand the difference in fulvic acid content between the two types of land, it's important to consider the differences in their environments and how these factors contribute to the formation and accumulation of fulvic acid. In the forest that Bill owned, the thick humus layers and rich diversity of large trees provided an environment where slow rates of decomposition occurred. Slow decomposition helps in the formation and retention of larger amounts of fulvic acid, a compound which is instrumental in enhancing chemical weathering in the soil. Additionally, the higher precipitation rates in forests lead to excess water percolating downward through the soil layers, resulting in a process called podzolization. During podzolization, elements like magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) are leached from the soil and transported downward. This process contributes to the higher amounts of fulvic acid, and subsequently, marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the forest soil layers. On the other hand, Rick's grassland had poorly developed soil. Grasslands typically have lower organic matter content, less diverse vegetation cover, and faster rates of decomposition compared to forests. These factors collectively contribute to the reduced production and accumulation of fulvic acid in grassland soils. Moreover, grasslands generally experience less precipitation, which decreases the amount of water percolating through the soil, therefore limiting podzolization and the subsequent leaching of elements that would otherwise lead to higher fulvic acid content. Taking these factors into account, it's evident that Rick's grassland had lower amounts of fulvic acid in its soil compared to his brother Bill's forest land."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

His strategy was to pick off Siam's peripheral regions rather than launch a full-scale invasion. On 30 November 1613, he sent a small army of 4,000 to drive out the Siamese from upper Tenasserim coast. On 26 December 1613, the army defeated the Siamese at Tavoy. The Burmese followed down to Tenasserim port itself. But the Burmese were driven back with heavy losses by the wealthy port's Portuguese broadsides in March 1614. The Siamese tried to retake Tavoy but failed. Anaukpetlun then switched theatres to Lan Na, which like Martaban before was only a nominal vassal of Siam.

Both sugar intake and fatty tissue increase the probability of elevated LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. Elevated amounts of Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is the primary factor in heart disease. In order to avoid all the dangers of sugar, moderate consumption is paramount. Q: Within the past 30 years, how has the number of diabetes cases changed?","response":"Within the past 30 years, the number of diabetes cases has quadrupled in the United States.

His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts., can you guess it ? The answer is:","response":"Tom. The first name of the person whose art bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh is Tom.

El hombre ha ido aprendiendo, desde los tiempos más remotos, a utilizar los recursos y materiales que la naturaleza le brindaba. Poco a poco aprendió a efectuar modificaciones sobre ellos, como en las aleaciones metálicas, pero sólo recientemente se ha producido una auténtica revolución con la creación de nuevos materiales, cada vez mejores, en mayor número y más adaptados a las propiedades específicas que en cada caso se les demandan. Nace así una nueva rama científica intrínsecamente interdisciplinar: La Ciencia de Materiales. Dentro de este campo, una importantísima propiedad en nuevos materiales orgánicos es la conductividad eléctrica, incluida la superconductividad.

Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. In early January 2010, multiple media outlets reported that, following the 2010 Winter Olympics, The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and begin airing weeknights at 11:35 pm ET, with Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon's shows following it beginning at 12:05 am on March 1, 2010. On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment Chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would indeed move to 11:35. Leno immediately accepted the return to 11:35 p.m., calling the move \\"all business.\\" He had made it known in the press in November 2009 that he wished to return to his old timeslot; behind the scenes, Leno had privately indicated that he did not believe the 10:00 experiment would work. On the other hand, O'Brien's contract stipulated that the network could move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty, a loophole put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions, the network's traditional nightly Wimbledon tournament highlights show, and specials such as New Year's Eve with Carson Daly. O'Brien did not seriously respond for several days after the announcement, then drafted a press release explaining why he felt it was unfair to him, his staff, Fallon, and the legacy of The Tonight Show to move the show past midnight. He concluded by saying that he \\"cannot participate in what I honestly believe is [The Tonight Show's] destruction.\\" O'Brien received an outpouring of celebrity and viewer support for rejecting the move, while Leno received heavy criticism.

Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return. Guess a valid title for it!

However, the provided statement doesn't convey explicit information about whether she is performing in a competition or not. The act of a woman figure skater holding her leg in the air by the blade of her skate doesn't automatically imply she's in a competition.

Gavin Boby, once linked to the far-right English Defence League, boasts he has already blocked plans for 16 out of 17 mosques being built. Under the banner of the Law and Freedom Foundation, he calls for people to come to him for free professional legal help in opposing mosque proposals and claims that Islam encourages paedophilia, sexual abuse and pimping. Scroll down for video. Gavin Boby, a self-styled 'mosque buster' who boasts that he has blocked plans for mosques being built and should be contacted for free legal advice. He claims to help followers resist planing applications for mosque developments by raising opposition with councils. The 48-year-old says in a video posted online: 'If anyone out there knows of an application for a new mosque, a cultural centre for some phoney community centre or some multi-faith inter-faith harmony institute then let me know.' Mr Boby, from Bristol, runs a planning consultancy but also provides legal assistant for those who oppose mosque developments, according to the Sunday Times. On the foundation website he claims to have stopped the construction of 16 out of 17 mosques in total. These include mosques in York, Blackpool, Bolton, Ealing and one in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, which was to replace 'the beautiful old Jolly Sailor Pub', according to the site. Mr Boby reportedly launched the service with a mock-up of the Ghostbusters logo - swapped for Mosquebusters - in which the ghost was replaced by hate preacher Abu Hamza. Vacancies for volunteers were posted on the EDL website. EDL has since endorsed the Law and Freedom Foundation, saying it is a 'great organisation' on Twitter and referring its followers who have a proposed mosque in their area to Mr Boby. In the website's 'about section' it explains the three threats to the survival of state authority in Britain and Europe. The Law and Freedom website which boasts 16 out of 17 plans to build mosques have been blocked. The third, it reads, is : 'Ethnic division, particularly between Islamic and non-Islamic. society, and the violence at the heart of Islamic doctrine. This is the. most visible problem, and the one that people will blame. 'Political and intellectual elites are undermining law or freedom. So we. need to take what action we can to preserve them ourselves.' Mr Boby has written an online guide that show how local citizens can make a legal case against mosques. In the guide it reads: 'Let councils know that they're on the hook for their decisions. Be relentless. Push.' He also suggests opposing an Islamic centre on the grounds of 'parking congestion', 'disturbance' and 'community relations'. The Jolly Sailor pub in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, which Mr Boby described as 'beautiful' and 'old'. There were proposals to turn the pub in to a mosque but Mr Boby helped block the plans. His advice is rooted in legal arguments, as he continues to suggest emphasising the proposed project will 'cause unacceptable pollution' from traffic and is a hazard to schoolchildren as it will 'bring outsiders with no connection to the area'. He appears to be driven by an apparent ideological hatred of Islam, referring in a video posted on YouTube to recent sex abuse cases, and claims mosques are 'not like churches' and are instead used to instruct followers to commit acts of paedophilia, sexual abuse and pimping. He says: 'Islamic doctrine permits, encourages and to a certain extent mandates Muslim men to take non-Muslim women as slaves to be used for sex. 'In order to stop the Islamic doctrine, which is the root of this problem, you have to prevent further mosques from being built.' Councils contacted by the Sunday Times said Mr Boby had not been instrumental in blocking the development of local mosques. Mr Boby told MailOnline: 'I are (sic) extremely proud that, when these concerned neighbourhoods approach us for help, we enable them to use the laws and consultation procedures that exist for their protection.' A spokesman for the EDL said: 'We support his organisation wholeheartedly and send many people from different communities with different issues concerning mosques in their area.'

To support this possibility, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has expressed his best wishes and good luck to Lula for his potential UN job candidacy. As a prominent political figure in Brazil, Lula served as the country's president from 2003 to 2011. During his tenure, he gained international recognition for his successful efforts in promoting social and economic development, as well as reducing poverty and inequality. His experience in international diplomacy and leadership make him a suitable candidate for a position within the United Nations. Upon hearing the rumors surrounding Lula's potential candidacy, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was quick to show his support. In a statement, Ban said, \\"I wish Mr. da Silva good luck in his rumored bid for a UN position. His experience and leadership on global issues could potentially benefit the organization in addressing pressing international concerns.\\" Lula's potential bid for a UN position remains unconfirmed, as the former president himself has not yet made an official announcement regarding his intentions. In the meantime, his supporters and political analysts are closely following the situation, speculating about the possible impact of his appointment on the UN and the international community. If Lula decides to pursue a role within the United Nations, it could mark a significant milestone in his already remarkable political career. Not only would this appointment provide him with an opportunity to further contribute to the global dialogue on pressing issues, but it could also potentially strengthen the relationship between Brazil and the UN, fostering greater international cooperation and collaboration. In conclusion, the rumors surrounding former Brazilian President Lula's possible bid for a UN position have garnered attention and support from high-ranking officials, including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. While Lula's intentions are not yet confirmed, his potential candidacy could have a profound impact on both the United Nations and the international community as a whole."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What city if Joe in where he is desperate for bus fare?

Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

Even if the life of a person has been a disaster, even if it is destroyed by vices, drugs or anything else_God is in this person's life.\\" ___ ON FAITH AND DOUBT: _\\"If one has the answers to all the questions_that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself. The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt. You must leave room for the Lord, not for our certainties; we must be humble.\\" ___ WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE OF WOMEN? Pope Francis has previously called for greater study of the role of women in the church, although he has ruled out women's ordination. He went further in this interview, saying women must be involved in top decision-making matters. _\\"The feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions. The challenge today is this: to think about the specific place of women also in those places where the authority of the church is exercised.\\" ___ ON BEING ARGENTINA'S JESUIT LEADER _\\"I found myself provincial (the Jesuit leader) when I was still very young. I was only 36 years old. That was crazy. ... It was my authoritarian way of making decisions that created problems.\\" ___ HOW DO YOU LIKE TO PRAY? _ \\"What I really prefer is adoration in the evening, even when I get distracted and think of other things, or even fall asleep praying. In the evening then, between seven and eight o'clock, I stay in front of the Blessed Sacrament for an hour in adoration. But I pray mentally even when I am waiting at the dentist or at other times of the day.\\" __ WHAT ABOUT THE OLD LATIN MASS? Pope Benedict XVI opened up the Latin Mass for wider use among traditionalists who were opposed to the modern liturgy: _ \\"I think the decision of Pope Benedict was prudent and motivated by the desire to help people who have this sensitivity. What is worrying, though, is the risk of the ideologization of the (Old Mass), its exploitation.\\" ___ HOW GREAT ARE THOSE NUNS?

When I went through my lung disease at the hospital, the doctor gave me penicillin and streptomycin in certain doses. The sister who was on duty tripled my doses because she was daringly astute; she knew what to do because she was with ill people all day.

In a wide-ranging interview published Thursday, the pope also said that women must play a key role in church decisions and brushed off critics who say he should be more vocal about fighting abortion and gay marriage. Moreover, if the church fails to find a \\"new balance\\" between its spiritual and political missions, the pope warned, its moral foundation will \\"fall like a house of cards.\\" The interview, released by Jesuit magazines in several different languages and 16 countries on Thursday, offers perhaps the most expansive and in-depth view of Francis' vision for the Roman Catholic Church. The pope's comments don't break with Catholic doctrine or policy, but instead show a shift in approach, moving from censure to engagement. Elected in March with the expectation that he would try to reform the Vatican, an institution that many observers say is riven by corruption and turf wars, Francis said his first mission is to change the church's \\"attitude.\\" \\"The church has sometimes locked itself up in small things,\\" the pope said, \\"in small-minded rules.\\" \\"The people of God want pastors,\\" Francis continued, \\"not clergy acting like bureaucrats or government officials.\\" MORE ON CNN: New interview shows why the pope is so beloved The interview was conducted by the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, editor of La Civilta Cattolica, a Jesuit journal based in Rome, over three meetings this August at Francis' apartment in Rome. The pope approved the transcript in Italian, according to America magazine, a Jesuit journal based in New York that initiated the interview and supervised its translation into English. Advance copies of the interview were provided to several news organizations, including CNN. Jesuits from around the world submitted questions to Spadaro. Francis answered them with the frankness that has become a hallmark of his young papacy. To begin the interview, Spadoro bluntly asks, \\"Who is Jorge Mario Bergolio?\\" - Francis's name before he was elected pope. \\"I am a sinner,\\" the pope answers. \\"This is the most accurate definition. It is not a figure of speech, a literary genre. I am a sinner.” The pope didn't mention any particular sins, and Catholic theology holds that all humans are sinners, a consequence of Adam and Eve's original transgression. Still, a pope describing himself foremost as \\"sinner\\" is striking. MORE ON CNN: The pope said what? Six stunners from Francis Offering new glimpses of his personal life, Francis said he prays at the dentist's office and felt trapped in the Vatican's traditional papal apartments. (He moved to a smaller one in a nearby building.) He has a taste for tragic artists and Italian films and keeps the will of his beloved grandmother in his prayerbook. But it was the pope's vision for the church's future - painted in broad strokes - that's sure to rile or inspire Catholics, depending on which side of the church they sit. Here are some highlights: On Women In July, Francis said, emphatically, that the \\"door is closed,\\" on women's ordination, a statement that disappointed many Catholic liberals. But that doesn't mean the church should consider women secondary or inferior, Francis said. \\"The feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions,\\" he told Spadora. Francis also called on Catholics to think hard about the function of women in the church. \\"Women are asking deep questions that must be addressed,\\" the pope said. \\"The church cannot be herself without the woman and her role.\\" On Homosexuality When Francis was a bishop in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he received letters from gays and lesbians who said they were \\"socially wounded\\" by the church, he said. \\"But the church does not want to do this,\\" Francis said in the interview. The pope then recalled his comments in July, when he told the media aboard a flight to Rome, \\"Who am I to judge\\" gay people? MORE ON CNN: Pope Francis on gays: 'Who am I to judge?' \\"By saying this, I said what the catechism says,\\" the pope told Spadaro. The catechism, the Catholic Church's book of official doctrine, condemns homosexual acts, but says gays and lesbians \\"must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity.\\" \\"Religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people, but God in creation has set us free: it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person.\\" Francis said that someone once asked him if he \\"approved\\" of homosexuality. \\"I replied with another question,\\" he said. \\"\`Tell me, when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?’ We must always consider the person. Here we enter into the mystery of the human being.\\" Abortion, gay marriage and contraception Some American Catholics grumble that Francis has been largely silent on signature Catholic political issues. \\"I’m a little bit disappointed in Pope Francis that he hasn’t, at least that I’m aware of, said much about unborn children, about abortion, and many people have noticed that,\\" Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, said earlier this month. Francis said that he's aware of the criticism, but he is not going to change. “We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods,\\" he told his Jesuit interviewer. \\"I have not spoken much about these things, and I was reprimanded for that.\\" But the pope said the church's teachings on those issue are clear, and he clearly believes in those teachings, so what else is there to say? \\"It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,\\" Francis said. False prophets and quick decisions Only false prophets claim to have all the answers, Francis said. \\"The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt,\\" he said. \\"You must leave room for the Lord.\\" But church leaders, including himself, haven't always practiced humility, the pope admitted. Many of the bad decisions he made while leading Catholics in Argentina came about because of his \\"authoritarianism and quick manner of making decisions,\\" the pope said. That won't happen again, Francis said, as he begins to steer the church in a new direction. He didn't offer an exact course, but he said change will come. Sooner or later. \\"Many think that changes and reforms can take place in a short time,\\" he said. \\"I believe that we always need time to lay the foundations for real, effective change. And this is the time of discernment.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","response":"In an interview with La Civilta Cattolica, a Jesuit journal in Rome, Pope Francis, the first Jesuit pope, reflected on his style, influences, and priorities. He emphasized the importance of finding God in everyone's life, humility, the role of women in the Church, being a leader, personal prayer, Latin Mass, nuns, and his favorite artists. In another wide-ranging interview, Pope Francis expressed that the Church has the right to express its opinions, but not to \\"interfere spiritually\\" in the lives of gays and lesbians. He stated that the Church must find a \\"new balance\\" between its spiritual and political missions, or else its moral foundations will fall \\"like a house of cards.\\" The Pope called for women to play a key role in Church decisions, and reiterated that the Church must not judge homosexuals. While his comments do not break with Catholic doctrine or policy, they signal a shift in approach from censure to engagement."},{"question":"Q:What is the full name of the person who was classified legally as a Frenchman? Answer the above question based on the context below: Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

The 32-year-old woman, a maid at the Sofitel Hotel in Manhattan, reportedly told her brother that she was trapped inside Strauss-Kahn's bedroom while he twice tried to force himself on her. \\"She rang me and she said, 'Somebody has done something really bad to me. I've been attacked,'\\" the woman's brother told the newspaper. Strauss-Kahn, who heads the International Monetary Fund, spent the night in jail at Rikers Island, a 400-acre penal complex that offers a strikingly different level of comfort than the 3,000-a-night Manhattan hotel suite where authorities say he tried to rape the maid. Strauss-Kahn was being held on a charge that would normally result in release, but he was denied bail Monday after prosecutors warned the wealthy banker might flee to France and put himself beyond the reach of U.S. law like the filmmaker Roman Polanski. Strauss-Kahn's weekend arrest rocked the financial world as the IMF grapples with the European debt crisis, and upended French presidential politics. Strauss-Kahn, a member of France's Socialist party, was widely considered the strongest potential challenger next year to President Nicolas Sarkozy. Making his first appearance Monday on the sex charges, a grim-looking Strauss-Kahn stood slumped before a judge in a dark raincoat and open-collared shirt. The 62-year-old, silver-haired economics chief said nothing as a lawyer professed Strauss-Kahn's innocence and strove in vain to get him released on bail. \\"This battle has just begun,\\" defense attorney Benjamin Brafman told scores of reporters outside the courthouse, adding that Strauss-Kahn might appeal the bail denial. Because of his high profile, Strauss-Kahn will be held in protective custody on Rikers Island, away from most detainees, said city Correction Department spokesman Stephen Morello. Unlike most prisoners who share 50-bed barracks, he will have a single-bed cell and will eat all of his meals alone there. He'll have a prison guard escort when he is outside his cell. Rikers is one of the nation's largest jail complexes, with a daily inmate population of about 14,000 — more than the prison populations of many states. The complex's notable history includes accounts of run-ins between inmates and guards. In one such case last year, a guard was sentenced to six years in prison for ordering inmate beatings as part of a rogue disciplinary system. Prosecutors said he imposed order in a unit at the complex by having teenage inmates beat other teenagers who had stepped out of line. The union that represents jail guards said the prisoners fabricated the allegations. Also last year, more than a dozen correction officers were injured while stopping fights between inmates awaiting pretrial hearings at a jail there. And in February, the city settled a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of an inmate who died after a scuffle with guards. Strauss-Kahn was ordered jailed at least until a court proceeding Friday. He cannot claim diplomatic immunity because he was in New York on personal business and was paying his own way, the IMF said. He could seek that protection only if he were conducting official business, spokesman William Murray said. The agency's executive board met informally Monday for a report on the charges against Strauss-Kahn, the managing director at the international lending agency since 2007. The French newspaper Le Monde, citing people close to Strauss-Kahn, said he had reserved the suite at the Sofitel hotel for one night for a quick trip to have lunch with his daughter, who is studying in New York. Strauss-Kahn is accused of attacking the maid, who had gone in to clean his penthouse suite Saturday afternoon at the luxury hotel near Times Square. He is charged with attempted rape, sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. The most serious charge carries five to 25 years in prison. The maid told authorities that she thought the suite was empty but that Strauss-Kahn emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway, pulled her into a bedroom and later dragged her into a bathroom, police said. He grabbed her breasts, tried to pull down her pantyhose, grabbed at her crotch and forced her to perform oral sex on him during the encounter at about noon, according to a court complaint. She ultimately broke free, escaped the room and told hotel staffers what had happened, authorities said. She was treated at a hospital for minor injuries. \\"The victim provided a very powerful and detailed account of the violent sexual assault,\\" Assistant District Attorney John \\"Ardie\\" McConnell said. He added that forensic evidence may support her account. Strauss-Kahn voluntarily submitted to a forensic examination Sunday night. The alleged victim's brother, whom the U.K. Daily Mail did not name, said he's confident Strauss-Kahn will be brought to justice. \\"I trust the American justice system and will let it do what it has to do,\\" the brother told the newspaper. \\"I want him to see justice. Justice will be served/\\" Brafman said defense lawyers believe the forensic evidence \\"will not be consistent with a forcible encounter.\\" Defense lawyers wouldn't elaborate, but Brafman said \\"there are significant issues that were already found\\" that make it \\"quite likely that he will be ultimately be exonerated.\\" Prosecutors asked the judge to hold Strauss-Kahn without bail, noting that he lives in France, is wealthy, has an international job and was arrested on a Paris-bound plane at Kennedy Airport. He had left the Sofitel hotel before police arrived, leaving his cell phone behind, and appeared hurried on surveillance recordings, authorities said. At one point, Strauss-Kahn called the hotel \\"in a panic\\" about the phone, a law enforcement official said Monday. Hotel security officers hadn't found a phone. But they were instructed by NYPD investigators to set a trap by informing him they had it and asking where they could get it to him, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation had not been completed. Strauss-Kahn told them he was about to board a flight — unknowingly tipping off authorities to his whereabouts, the official said. Prosecutors said they couldn't force Strauss-Kahn's return from France if he went there. \\"He would be living openly and notoriously in France, just like Roman Polanski,\\" said Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel Alonso, referring to the film director long sought by California authorities for sentencing in a 1977 child sex case. Defense lawyers suggested bail be set at 1 million and promised that the IMF managing director would remain in New York City. His lawyers said Strauss-Kahn wasn't trying to elude police Saturday: The IMF head rushed out of the hotel at about 12:30 p.m. to get to a lunch date with a family member, then caught a flight for which he had long had a ticket, they said. Allegations of other, similar attacks by Strauss-Kahn began to emerge Monday. In France, a lawyer for a novelist said the writer is likely to file a criminal complaint accusing him of sexually assaulting her nine years ago. A French lawmaker accused him of attacking other maids in previous stays at the same luxury hotel. And in New York, prosecutors said they are working to verify reports of at least one other case, which they suggested was overseas. A lawyer for 31-year-old French novelist Tristane Banon said she will probably file a complaint alleging Strauss-Kahn sexually attacked her in 2002. Lawyer David Koubbi told French radio RTL that Banon hadn't pressed her claim earlier because of \\"pressures\\" but would do so now because \\"she knows she'll be taken seriously.\\" The Associated Press is identifying Banon as an alleged victim of sexual assault because she has gone public with her account. McConnell, the assistant district attorney, said in court Monday that New York authorities are working to verify at least one other case of \\"conduct similar to the conduct alleged.\\" When the judge asked whether the potential other incident occurred in the United States, McConnell said he \\"believed that was abroad.\\" In France, defenders of Strauss-Kahn, a former finance minister who had topped the polls as a possible candidate in presidential elections next year, said they suspected he was the victim of a smear campaign.

Short-lived performance: The reviewer shares their experience of the product's performance, highlighting that it only functioned for a short duration (about half an hour) before failing. This raises concerns about the product's durability and reliability. 3. Negative overall experience: The review title itself, \\"You Can Take A Chance,\\" implies an element of uncertainty or risk in purchasing the product.

Today, 14 staff attorneys, 26 office workers and 21 University of Memphis third- year law students work out of rented offices in the old Claridge Hotel building at 109 N. Main. Offices are spartan. There are no lush rugs or stylish furniture. The large table in the conference room is simple varnished wood. Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees. But so many of the cases we handle have to do with basic rights and a decent life. There is just no profit motive.\\" Larry Pivnick, law professor at the University of Memphis Law School and director of political programs at MALS, said Legal Services is a great learning laboratory for law students. \\"There are thousands and thousands of people who have problems that never get an opportunity to appear in court,\\" Pivnick said. \\"Some people may not be particularly articulate. Courts have rules that clients don't always understand.\\" Brewer said a major focus of the agency's work involves housing. \\"Although a lot of our work is grant-driven, we find that the lack of safe and decent affordable housing and the prevalence of predatory lending are the biggest problems in our client population,\\" Brewer said, referring to clients such as James. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What type of work is done by MALS?\\" is \\"Medical work\\"? [A]. no [B]. yes","response":"[A]. no MALS does not do medical work. Instead, they focus on providing legal assistance to low-income individuals, as mentioned in the passage. They deal with issues related to housing, basic rights, and ensuring a decent life for their clients. The passage does not mention any medical work being done by MALS."},{"question":"Answer this question.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why has the narrator chosen to put off moving their stuff for so many days ?","response":"Based on the evidence provided in the passage, several reasons can be identified for the narrator's decision to put off moving their stuff for so many days. 1. Emotional state: The narrator expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with their situation, potentially due to a lack of help from their mother. This emotional state could have diminished their motivation and focus on the task at hand. Mentioning ice cream in the freezer indicates the narrator might be seeking comfort or stress relief, supporting the idea that they could be emotionally distraught, and thus postponed the moving task. 2. Feeling guilty and overcompensating with work: The narrator reveals that they spent the next three days working on lecture prep after feeling guilty for declaring the rest of Monday a wash, which indicates they might have prioritized work-related tasks over their moving responsibilities. Going from not working at all to spending the majority of their time on lecture prep might have left little room to focus on moving furniture during those days. 3. External factors: The narrator had to spend a significant portion of their Tuesday morning at the driver's license office, which prevented them from moving their furniture that day. This experience added to their delay in completing the tasks they wanted to do. In summary, the narrator's decision to put off moving their stuff is influenced by their emotional state, a sense of guilt that led them to prioritize work over moving, and external factors that consumed their time. These factors, taken together, resulted in the narrator's choice to delay moving their furniture both at home and at work."},{"question":"Translate \\"Moreover, when we compare this gap in the third year of the current Financial Perspective with the gap in the third year of the previous Financial Perspective, which was only 3%, we simply do not see how such an enormous gap can be justified.\\" to Czech?","response":"Navíc, když porovnáme tuto mezeru ve třetím roce současného finančního výhledu s mezerou ve třetím roce předchozího finančního výhledu, která činila pouze 3%, opravdu nevidíme, jak lze tak obrovskou mezeru zdůvodnit.

During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic asthma, which also plagued her at a later age. Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, the owner of a carriage company, decided that it would be good for her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz. Context: The first major female tennis star to turn professional, Lenglen was paid US50,000 by American entrepreneur Charles C. Pyle to tour the United States in a series of matches against Mary K. Browne. Browne, winner of the US Championships from 1912 to 1914, was 35 and considered to be past her prime, although she had reached the French final earlier that year (losing to Lenglen 6-1, 6-0). For the first time in tennis history, the women's match was the headline event of the tour (which also featured male players). In their first match in New York City, Lenglen put on a performance that New York Times writer Allison Danzig lauded as \\"one of the most masterly exhibitions of court generalship that has been seen in this country.\\" When the tour ended in February 1927, Lenglen had defeated Browne, 38 matches to 0. She was exhausted from the lengthy tour, and a physician advised Lenglen that she needed a lengthy period away from the game to recover. Instead, Lenglen chose to retire from competitive tennis to run a Paris tennis school, which she set up with the help and money of her lover Jean Tillier. The school, located next to the courts of Roland Garros, slowly expanded and was recognised as a federal training centre by the French tennis federation in 1936. During this period, Lenglen also wrote several books on tennis. Lenglen was criticised widely for her decision to turn professional, and the All England Club at Wimbledon even revoked her honorary membership. Lenglen, however, described her decision as \\"an escape from bondage and slavery\\" and said in the tour programme, \\"In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis and have paid thousands of francs in entrance fees to be allowed to do so.... I have worked as hard at my career as any man or woman has worked at any career. And in my whole lifetime I have not earned 5,000 - not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study - tennis.... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy - should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? Or should I smile at the prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune - for whom?\\" As for the amateur tennis system, Lenglen said, \\"Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, and the fact of the matter is that only wealthy people do compete. Is that fair? Does it advance the sport? Does it make tennis more popular - or does it tend to suppress and hinder an enormous amount of tennis talent lying dormant in the bodies of young men and women whose names are not in the social register?\\" Question: How did Suzanne Lenglen commence her professional career?. Whats the answer?","response":"Suzanne Lenglen began her professional career when a man named Charles C. Pyle paid her US50,000 to play tennis in the United States. She played many matches against another lady named Mary K. Browne. Imagine if you played a lot of games against your friend and you won all of them. That's what Suzanne did, winning all 38 matches! But she was very tired after playing so many games and got sick, so she had to stop playing for a while. Then she decided to stop playing in competitions and instead started a school where she taught others how to play tennis. Does that make sense?"},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing. Write the full name if mentioned in the text. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Last Monday in Vancouver the feisty Canucks wing Alex Burrows -- suddenly a hot scorer -- was named the NHL's first star of the week. But the referee Stephane Auger was not congratulating him later that evening when television cameras caught him with his arm around Burrows' shoulder before a game against Nashville. \\"It was personal \\" Burrows told reporters after the game. He said that Auger complained that he had made him look bad in a game on Dec. 8 against Nashville. \\"He said he was going to get me back tonight and that's what he did in the third I think \\" Burrows said. Burrows said the league should suspend Auger for the rest of the season something the league declined to do. In the first game at Nashville Burrows was hit by the Predators' Jerred Smithson. Auger assessed Smithson a five-minute charging major and a game misconduct but the league later rescinded the misconduct. In the third period of the second game Auger called two penalties on Burrows. In the final moments Burrows complained to Auger who slapped him with an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. On Wednesday the NHL fined Burrows 2 500 for his remarks and issued no sanction against Auger saying that the nature of the pregame conversation between the two men \\"could not be substantiated.\\" Colin Campbell said that Auger told Burrows he did not need his help in making calls and did not appreciate the embellishment.

Right from the moment I set my foot on the premises, I was immediately taken aback by the meticulously maintained gardens, immaculate arrangements, and an ambiance that seemed to serenely whisper tranquility. Despite being nestled amid high concrete structures and noisy streets, Eden Gardens was as breathtaking as it was surprising. On entering, a friendly and professional attendant greeted me. He efficiently guided me through the ticketing process and gave a brief introduction about the gardens' history and physical map, which was both interesting and useful to navigate through. The Gardens brim with diversified flora and fauna, exhibiting an array of vivid colors and patterns. Perfectly trimmed hedges, proudly standing trees of all shapes and sizes, contrasting against the vibrant blankets of flowers gently swaying with the breeze was a sight to behold. It was a haven for a photographer, a delight for a botanist, and nirvana for someone seeking peace. Apart from the mesmerizing natural beauty, there were well-spaced, comfortable seating chairs. Not to forget the numerous thoughtfully placed waste bins, promoting a clean and litter-free environment. Here, one could unreservedly lose track of time delving into a book, sketching the picturesque scenery, or simply relaxing. The Garden also housed a quaint little café aptly named “The Garden Delights Cafe.” It offered a wide array of refreshments with several healthy and organic options. The staff was warm and attentive, and the service was prompt. Sipping coffee overlooking the beautifully landscaped gardens was an experience in itself. What significantly drew my attention was the well-paved and unobtrusive wheelchair-accessible paths. The Gardens demonstrates an inclusive approach, which was heartening to witness. Family friendly features like large grassy areas for informal games, clean restroom facilities, and a children's play area have been incorporated seamlessly into the Garden’s setting. Furthermore, the Garden's management team deserves a mention for their impeccable maintenance of such a vast area. The park consistently exhibited spruceness, a testament to their dedication towards providing visitors with a delightful experience. The presence of adequate security staff further augmented a sense of safety within the premises. Something that is not to be missed is the magnificent sunset view. As dusk descended, the silhouette of the trees against oranges, purples, and pinks of the setting sun was Nature’s masterpiece. In conclusion, Eden Gardens is a cherished public space promoting wellness, relaxation, and recreation. It's a shining example of blending nature within an urban setting. A visit to this lovely oasis comes strongly recommended – immerse yourself in the gift of natural beauty. Eden Gardens is not just a place to visit; it's an experience."},{"question":"Most businesses would hate to see their customers running out their doors, but in one suburban strip mall near Denver, Colorado, they are chasing the customers away -- with a chainsaw. \\"We're 'hauntrepreneurs,' we like to do things that are just a little bit different,\\" says KathE Walker, who owns four haunted houses in the Denver area. \\"It's really exciting because you know you've done a good job,\\" Walker says. \\"If they are running out screaming, then the actors have done their jobs, everybody has had a good time because they want to be scared. That's why they come. \\"If they're not scared, they won't come back.\\" KathE Walker -- the capital E isn't a typo, \\"it's a '60s thing,\\" she says -- laughs a lot for a woman in the business of scaring her customers. Walker, 59, runs her haunts with her husband and two grown sons. They spend the rest of the year making props for other haunted houses around the country and they throw a big science fiction convention each spring. Despite the tough economy, Walker says, business is good. She anticipates a total of 40,000-50,000 visitors, each paying 14.95 to get scared. She employs about 175 people for the Halloween season. Three of her haunts are in unused storefronts in suburban strip malls and a fourth operates out of trailers in a field near a state park. Visitors are also asked to contribute a can of food for a local food bank. Larry Kirchner, president of the Haunted House Association, says business is booming across the country for seasonal frightfests. The association says there are 2,000 for-profit haunts across the country, plus another 1,000 houses run for charity. Around 20 million fright-seekers will pay an average of 15 a visit this Halloween season, according to the group. That's a surprising figure to some in these lean economic times. \\"We feel very fortunate,\\" Walker says. \\"I know that the economy is very scary for a lot of people. The people that we aim the haunted houses at are kids in high school and college, kids that have a lot more disposable income. They're still living with their parents. \\"We don't draw a lot of people that are desperate to make their mortgages. ... It's great date-night stuff. Guys love bringing their girlfriends here, they're holding onto them. It's fun.\\" It's fun for Walker, too. While giving a tour of Slaughterhouse Gulch, which features a series of movie monsters, she giggles as a cluster of date-night teenagers scream and run from Leatherface, the villain from the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" films. \\"You make some money, obviously that's why you keep doing it,\\" she says. \\"But for the most part we put a lot of money back into the haunted house so we can keep making them bigger and better. ... It can be kind of expensive. You cross your fingers each year hoping people will come.\\" Walker says she loves the challenge of scaring people. \\"Some people come in and they say 'Oh you can't scare me,' \\" she says. \\"And they all end up running out of here, just terrified.\\" So what scares Walker? \\"Clowns. I hate clowns. It took me a long time to finally let clowns be in the haunted house.\\" 'Scaring people is really fun' Walker staffs her haunted houses with teens and 20-somethings who seem to have as much fun as the patrons.

Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - Henrietta Maria of France (25 November 1609 10 September 1669) was queen consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of his two immediate successors, Charles II and James II. - Barrier islands are coastal landforms and a type of dune system that are exceptionally flat or lumpy areas of sand that form by wave and tidal action parallel to the mainland coast. They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. They are subject to change during storms and other action, but absorb energy and protect the coastlines and create areas of protected waters where wetlands may flourish. A barrier chain may extend uninterrupted for over a hundred kilometers, excepting the tidal inlets that separate the islands, the longest and widest being Padre Island of Texas. The length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including tidal range, wave energy, sediment supply, sea-level trends, and basement controls. - The Chincoteague Pony, also known as the Assateague horse, is a breed of pony that developed and lives in a feral condition on Assateague Island in the United States states of Virginia and Maryland. The breed was made famous by the \\"Misty of Chincoteague\\" series written by Marguerite Henry starting in 1947. While phenotypically horse-like, they are commonly called \\"ponies\\". This is due in part to their smaller stature, created by the poor habitat on Assateague Island. Variation is found in their physical characteristics due to blood from different breeds being introduced at various points in their history. They can be any solid color, and are often found in pinto patterns, which are a favorite with breed enthusiasts. Island Chincoteagues live on a diet of salt marsh plants and brush. This poor-quality and often scarce food combined with uncontrolled inbreeding created a propensity for conformation faults in the Chincoteague before outside blood was added beginning in the early 20th century. - Padre Island is the largest of the Texas barrier islands and is the world's longest barrier island. It is part of the U.S. state of Texas. The island is located along Texas' southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is noted for its white sandy beaches at the south end. Meaning \\"father\\" in Spanish, it was named after Father José Nicolás Ballí (c.1770-1829), who owned the island and served as a missionary priest and collector of finances for all the churches in the Rio Grande Valley. He also founded the first mission in present-day Cameron County. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - Sinepuxent Bay is an inland waterway which connects Chincoteague Bay to Isle of Wight Bay, and is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Ocean City Inlet. It separates Sinepuxent Neck, in Worcester County, Maryland from Assateague Island, and West Ocean City, Maryland from downtown Ocean City. Islands in the Sinepuxent Bay include Horn Island and Skimmer Island. It is crossed by the Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge on U.S. Route 50 and the Verrazano Bridge on Maryland Route 611 (not to be confused with the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City; both were named for Giovanni da Verrazzano, who explored the coastline in 1524). The bay is the location of the islands that compose the Sinepuxent Bay Wildlife Management Area. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all U.S. national parks, many American national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations. It was created on August 25, 1916, by Congress through the National Park Service Organic Act and is an agency of the United States Department of the Interior. The NPS is charged with a dual role of preserving the ecological and historical integrity of the places entrusted to its management while also making them available and accessible for public use and enjoyment. - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. - Charles I (19 November 1600 30 January 1649) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649. - Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as \\"Washington\\", \\"the District\\", or simply \\"D.C.\\", is the capital of the United States. - A motor vehicle is a self-propelled road vehicle and off-road vehicle, commonly wheeled, that does not operate on rails, such as trains or trams and used for commercial purposes on the highways in the transportation of passengers, or passengers and property. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England. - The Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife preserve operated by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. It is primarily located on the Virginia half of Assateague Island with portions (only about 3%) located on the Maryland side of the island, as well as Morris Island and Wildcat Marsh. The refuge contains a large variety of wildlife animals and birds, including the Chincoteague Pony. The purpose of the refuge is to maintain, regulate and preserve animal and plant species as well as their habitats for present and future generations. - Assateague Island National Seashore is a unit of the National Park Service occupying about half of Assateague Island, located off Maryland's eastern shore on the Atlantic Ocean. The park covers an area of . The portion of the island designated as national seashore extends South of the Ocean City inlet to the Maryland/Virginia state border. In addition, a one-mile portion of the VA district including the recreational beach and interpretive facilities is managed by the National Park Service. Over 2.1 million people visit the park each year. The park was created in 1965 after a strong nor'easter (the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962) destroyed the planned, but never built, resort community of Ocean Beach, Maryland. The national seashore is famous for its white sand beaches and wild ponies. - A nor'easter (also northeaster; see below) is a macro-scale cyclone. The name derives from the direction of the strongest windsas an offshore air mass rotates counterclockwise, winds tend to blow northeast-to-southwest over the region covered by the northwest quadrant of the cyclone. Use of the term in North America is associated with several different types of storms, some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Typically, such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within of the shore between Georgia and New Jersey. The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms. Noreasters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow, and can cause severe coastal flooding, coastal erosion, hurricane-force winds, or blizzard conditions. Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Canadian Maritimes. They thrive on converging air massesthe cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the waterand are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater. - The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is a government agency in the state of Maryland charged with maintaining natural resources including state parks, public lands, state forests, state waterways, wildlife and recreation areas.

If you receive a mailing that does not look familiar, read through it and look for common fraudulent practices. If you see something that usually occurs in fraudulent mailings, be suspicious. For example, fraudulent mailings commonly: Require you to pay \\"insurance\\", \\"processing\\", or \\"service\\" fees. Ask you to provide someone with personal information, including Social Security numbers and credit card information. Promise things that are too good to be true (e.g., unreasonable returns on investments, loans for people with bad credit). Pressure you into making decisions quickly (e.g., require that you respond to the mailing within a matter of days). If you get a mailing that looks out of the ordinary, do some research. A lot of fraudulent mailings will be disguised to look like something legitimate. For example, some fraudsters will make their mailings look identical to official government documents. In another common scenario, fraudsters will disguise their scheme as a legitimate invoice (e.g., an outstanding bill). If you get one of these mailings: Do a quick online search to see if anyone else has gotten them. Describe the mailing in your search and include the word \\"fraud.\\" There are websites dedicated to people who report questionable mailings. Search online to verify the accuracy of the information in the mailing. For example, if the mailing provides an address, consider searching for the address online and see what comes up. Call the number on the mailing. If a phone number is provided, call and question their intentions. If you do speak with someone, try to gauge their demeanor. Are they nervous? Are they pushy? Are they rude? If you do speak with someone, never give out any personal information. In addition to common practices, fraudsters usually utilize the same schemes over and over again. If you get a piece of mail you suspect may be fraud, analyze it and see if it fits within one of the following categories: Sweepstakes and 'free' prizes 'Free' vacations Solicitations disguised as invoices Foreign lotteries Chain letters Charity fraud Investment fraud Fees charged for services that are normally free Advance-fee loans Unsolicited merchandise Fake check scams Don't fall for fraudsters who disguise their solicitations as invoices. Often, people will try to get you to buy something by making their mailing look like a bill. They are hoping you will automatically pay and think you placed an order but forgot about it. Always read the fine print. Most of these mailings will state they are solicitations but will do so in small print on the bottom of the mailing. Never make a payment until you have verified whether you actually ordered something. If you haven't ordered the item it says you did, or if you haven't received the item it says you did, do not pay. A lot of fraudsters will take advantage of your good will and will ask you to donate to phony charities. This type of mail fraud often takes place after a natural disaster or some other event that the country rallies behind. To avoid this type of fraud, only give to charities you know and trust. Check out the charities you don't know. Look online to determine what they are about. Beware of organizational names that are similar (but not the same) to reputable charities. Do not donate to charities that only accept cash. If you do write a check, always make it payable to the organization and not to an individual. Avoid investment solicitations you get in the mail that promise unreasonable returns on your investments. Fraudulent promoters will try to get you to invest a lot of money in bogus vehicles (e.g., fake securities, commodities, or property). If you can answer \\"yes\\" to any of the following questions, you may be dealing with mail fraud: Does the mailing make it sound as if you cannot lose? Are you promised unusually high rates of return? Are you pressured into making a decision quickly? If you have trouble obtaining loans through normal means, you may get targeted for advance-fee loan schemes. These mailings will offer you \\"guaranteed\\" loans so long as you pay a fee in advance. The mailing will usually tell you they can obtain a loan for you without a problem. In reality, the person has no such ability. If you pay the fee, the fraudster will take your money and not return any phone calls. Only enter into loan agreements with reputable lending institutions (e.g., banks and credit unions). Always read and understand the terms of your loan before signing. Never allow someone to choose and enter into a loan for you. A lot of mail fraud takes the form of unsolicited gifts, which are sent to you with the hope you will pay a fee for it. If you receive a free gift in the mail that you did not ask for, you can do any of the following: If it has not been opened, you can simply return it. If you have opened it but do not want the gift, you can simply throw it away. If you want to keep the gift, you can do so. For free. Do not send any money to the person who sent the gift. Unsolicited merchandise is yours to keep. Summary:","response":"Mail fraud involves various schemes that usually ask for money or personal information. To identify and avoid mail fraud, be cautious of mailings that require payment for \\"insurance,\\" \\"processing,\\" or \\"service\\" fees, ask for personal information, promise unrealistic returns or benefits, or pressure you into making quick decisions. Fraudulent mailings may imitate official government documents or legitimate invoices. Conduct research online to verify the legitimacy of the mailings, and never give out personal information. Common types of mail fraud include sweepstakes, 'free' vacations, fake invoices, foreign lotteries, charity fraud, investment fraud, advance-fee loans, and unsolicited merchandise. To avoid falling victim to mail fraud, be vigilant in reading the fine print, only make payments for verified orders, give to known and trusted charities, avoid suspicious investment opportunities, and deal with reputable lending institutions. If you receive unsolicited gifts, you are not obligated to pay any fees or send money to the sender, and you can keep the merchandise for free."},{"question":"Which of the following two sentences does not make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"Most people like to have coffee and doughnuts in the morning.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Most people like to have hamburgers and pudding in the morning.\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","response":"Both sentences can be considered grammatically correct and make sense in terms of structure. However, we need to determine which sentence is less common or less likely to be true based on typical food preferences and habits. Sentence A: \\"Most people like to have coffee and doughnuts in the morning.\\" This sentence makes sense, as it is a common preference for many people to have coffee and doughnuts as a breakfast meal or snack in the morning. Coffee is frequently consumed in the morning to help people wake up and feel energized, while doughnuts are a popular sweet treat that pairs well with coffee. Sentence B: \\"Most people like to have hamburgers and pudding in the morning.\\" This sentence is less likely to make sense, as hamburgers and pudding are not typically considered breakfast foods. While some people might enjoy having a hamburger or pudding earlier in the day, it's not a popular choice for the majority of people as a morning meal. Breakfast foods are generally lighter and simpler in comparison to hamburgers, which are usually consumed during lunch or dinner. Pudding is also typically considered a dessert item, so it is less likely that most people would prefer it in the morning. Based on the analysis, Sentence B, \\"Most people like to have hamburgers and pudding in the morning,\\" is the option that makes less sense in terms of typical food preferences and habits."},{"question":"\\"Actiniaria (family list)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it.

A: A:","response":"A: Solvation is a crucial process in a variety of chemical and biological systems, as it involves the interaction of solute particles, such as ions or molecules, with the molecules of a solvent. In order to understand solvation, it is important to recognize the role that solvent molecules play in stabilizing and organizing the solute particles. One of the key aspects of solvation is the formation of a \\"solvation shell\\" or hydration shell in the case of water as the solvent, which involves the surrounding of solute ions or molecules by solvent molecules. This shell forms due to the electrostatic interactions between the charged or polarized regions of the solute and solvent particles, as well as through hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions, and van der Waals forces. The solvation shell helps to stabilize the solute particles and reduce their tendency to interact with each other, thereby facilitating their dissolution or dispersion in the solvent. In the case of a polar solvent such as water, the solvation process is typically driven by the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the solute particles. When a positively charged solute ion (cation) is introduced into the water, the oxygen atoms in the water molecules, which possess a partial negative charge due to their electronegativity, will orient themselves towards the cation, forming a solvation shell around it. In contrast, for a negatively charged solute ion (anion), the hydrogen atoms in the water molecules, which bear a partial positive charge, will surround the anion, creating another solvation shell. The solvation shell, therefore, effectively neutralizes the charged solute ion and minimizes its interactions with other ions in the solution. For non-polar or less polar solvents, the solvation process involves the formation of a solvation shell through van der Waals forces and, in some cases, dipole-induced dipole interactions, which can arise due to the temporary distortion of electron density in the solute and solvent molecules. These weaker forces promote the organization of solvent molecules around the solute particles and drive their dispersion or dissolution in the solvent. To summarize, solvation involves the surrounding of solute ions or molecules with solvent molecules, which form a solvation shell through various types of interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic forces, van der Waals forces, and dipole-induced dipole interactions. These interactions stabilize the solute particles in the solution and reduce their tendency to aggregate, promoting the overall dissolution or dispersion of solutes in solvents."},{"question":"Question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

But the way to test a student's knowledge and ability still remains as poor as it was. We have almost done nothing to improve our examination system. It is well known that the examination system we are now using may be a good way of testing a student's memory, but it can tell you nothing about a student's ability. It does no good to students and teachers. As soon as a child begins school, he enters a world of examination that will decide his future of job. In fact a good examination system should train a student to think for himself. But it now does nothing about that. So students are encouraged to member what is taught. It does not enable them to gain more and note knowledge. The students who come out first in the examination often may not be the best in their studies. Besides, the examinations often force teachers to train students what to do with the coming examination from time to time. There must be some simpler and better way to test a student' s ability besides knowledge. And that is what we should do at once.

Step 2: Set the goal for an improved examination system The goal is to develop an examination system that trains students to think for themselves and assesses their abilities beyond memorizing information. Step 3: Determine how teachers can help achieve the goal Teachers can develop their students' abilities by engaging them in activities that promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. They can also use various assessment methods that go beyond traditional testing. Step 4: Implement the new teaching approach Teachers should incorporate strategies that focus on developing their students' abilities throughout their lessons. This may include problem-based learning, group discussions, and practical applications of knowledge. Step 5: Monitor progress and adjust teaching strategies as needed Teachers should regularly assess their students' development and progress to determine the effectiveness of their teaching strategies. They should be willing to adapt their methods as needed to ensure students are developing the desired abilities. By following these steps, teachers can help improve the examination system to better assess and develop a student's abilities beyond just memorization.

But the 40yearold Langteau isn't a parent.He's a veteran of the video game industry--one who played producer on three \\"Medal of Honor\\" games and cofounded his own game development company. Langteau has just published a children's books called Sofa Boy,which tells the story of a kid who spends too much time sitting on the couch with controller clutched in hand and the rather terrible consequences that follow. It's a fairy tale plucked straight from Langteau's own experiences as a lad with a fondness for video games and his own bouts with a bit of game addiction.But first,Langteau would like to make one thing clear,\\"I'm not saying that you shouldn't play video games.I think video games are great.I think they do great things for kids.\\"Instead,Langteau says his book is all about a little something called moderation . \\"It's about being well rounded,\\" he says.\\"Just like with anything else,we all need to make sure that there's a variety in what we do.\\" Video gamers can be rather badtempered when it comes to accepting criticism about their favorite entertainment.And understandably so.After all,most people who go around talking about the dangers of playing video games tend to be outsiders--people who don't play video games and certainly don't understand that they can be a valuable and healthy form of entertainment.

Translate to English English:","response":"We wish to see the restoration of the General Assembly and the Senate, and we demand respect for the mandates and immunities of parliamentarians. In elaborating further on this statement, the speaker is expressing a desire for the reestablishment of the General Assembly and the Senate. The General Assembly is a legislative body that brings together representatives from various constituencies to vote on and discuss matters of national importance. The Senate, on the other hand, is a smaller legislative chamber, often made up of representatives elected or appointed to serve on behalf of specific constituencies or regions, or as representatives of particular interest groups. By calling for the restoration of these two entities, the speaker may be signaling that they believe the democratic process has been disrupted or weakened, or that the will of the people is not being adequately represented in the current political landscape. This could be in response to a political crisis, a perceived power imbalance, or any number of other factors that may threaten the functioning of a democratic system. Alongside the reinstatement of these legislative bodies, the statement also emphasizes the importance of respecting the mandates and immunities of parliamentarians. A mandate, in this context, refers to the authority a representative is granted either by voters or in accordance with established procedures in order to fulfill their duties as a member of a legislative body. The respect of the mandates thus implies that elected or appointed officials should have the authority to carry out their responsibilities without undue interference. In addition, immunity for parliamentarians is another important component of a well-functioning democracy. Immunity protects members of the legislative bodies from certain types of legal repercussions, which may arise as a result of the actions they've taken in their official capacity. This protection ensures that they are able to act in the best interests of their constituents without fear of retribution or false accusations. It encourages open and honest debate, as well as the transparent performance of one's public duties. In summary, the statement calls for the restoration of the General Assembly and Senate to strengthen the democratic process and ensure that the will of the people is effectively represented. Alongside this, the speaker demands that the mandates and immunities of parliamentarians are respected, enabling them to act without fear and in the best interests of their constituents. This suggests a belief that these key components of a well-functioning democracy have been undermined and that action must be taken to address these issues."},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: (B)","response":"Question: Which of the following best describes Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula? Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Alright, let's try to remember what we've learned about Albert Einstein and his famous formulas. We know he was a physicist who made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of the universe. Now, one of his most famous equations is E=mc². This equation demonstrates the relationship between mass and energy. In this formula, 'E' stands for energy, 'm' is the mass, and 'c' is the speed of light in vacuum, which is a constant. The equation shows that energy can be converted into mass and vice versa, and when the mass is multiplied by the square of the speed of light, it yields the equivalent energy amount. Therefore, the best way to describe this formula is as a mass-energy equivalence equation.

(CNN) -- Does John Edwards deserve to go to prison? The jury has decided, and he's walking. Whatever we may think of the Edwards trial, one thing is certain: the prosecution was a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money on a non-crime. Who cares if a billionaire wants to give a multimillionaire some money to hide his mistress (who pays taxes on the gift)? The prosecution of Edwards was never so much about Edwards as it was about George Holding. Wait -- who is George Holding? And why should we care? After winning a recent primary, Holding is likely the next congressman in the 13th District of North Carolina. He initiated the prosecution against Edwards while he was a U.S. Attorney. But he didn't argue the case in court. Instead, after receiving a year's worth of headlines (and Republican praise) for charging Edwards, Holding resigned from the case to run for Congress. Of course, prosecuting OPTIONS: - Andrew Young wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - CNN wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Congress wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Edwards wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - George Holding wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Holding wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Jeff Smith wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - John Edwards wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - North Carolina wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Republican wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Smith wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - U.S. wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress.","response":"Of course, prosecuting John Edwards wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. It seems that the pursuit of this case was more about enhancing Holding's political career than it was about achieving justice. With the media attention the case garnered, Holding was able to capitalize on his role as the prosecutor, even though he stepped down from the case before it went to court. The fact that the jury ultimately decided against sending Edwards to prison suggests that the case may not have been as strong as it initially seemed. Yet, Holding's decision to focus on such a high-profile target has allowed him to ride the wave of publicity all the way to a likely seat in Congress. This situation raises questions about the motivations behind certain legal actions by ambitious politicians seeking to make a name for themselves. Moreover, the Edwards trial serves as a cautionary example of the potential dangers of allowing political ambitions to influence legal processes. When prosecutors focus on cases that will generate attention, rather than on those that are truly deserving of their time and resources, it can lead to the unjust treatment of individuals involved. Additionally, it diverts attention from other more serious matters that require the time and expertise of skilled prosecutors with the best interests of the public in mind. In the end, the question of whether or not John Edwards deserves to go to prison remains a matter of personal opinion and debate. What is clear, however, is that the prosecution of Edwards served the interests of George Holding far more than it did the interests of justice. As Holding moves on to his new role in Congress, one can only hope that he will strive to bring about change in a way that truly serves the needs of his constituents, rather than focusing on furthering his own career through the manipulation of public opinion and political maneuvering."},{"question":"Q:Title: WIll not last Review: There are three of these squeaker balls in the pack.

Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler in the middle of a sub-zero frozen Arctic lake. Tyler is at a loss of what to do about his situation until he is rescued by a traveling Inuit named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who transports him and his gear off the ice and builds a shelter for him. Alone, Tyler divides his days between research and survival, while nights are fraught with nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves â which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them. He and the wolves begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them.

With so many confusing headlines hitting your inboxes on a daily basis and the dreaded Christmas shopping to come, here’s an early tonic to focus into 2013. A top eight ‘risks, ruses and rumblers’ for energy in 2013. Here goes: 1) Risk: MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles Hardly new I know, but no matter what any investment house tells you on benchmark prices, we’re stuck in a 50-150/b world, that’s defined by whichever part of the supply-demand balance proves to be most dysfunctional at any one time. The key supply side risk remains the Middle East. The political debris from 2011-12 will continue into 2013 and beyond, with popular pressures continually growing. That’s not just in the Arab Nationalist Republics such as Egypt, where vocal demonstrators on Tahrir Square have made clear President Morsi needs to deliver the goods or else. Or indeed Syria, whose internal implosion will have increasingly regional effects: But in Gulf Monarchy’s as well. The trigger point to watch is all about political secession. The exact timings are by definition uncertain, but Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and most importantly Saudi Arabia, are in the same boat. If the old secession model passing power from one aging leader to another is seen to be broken, then prices will rapidly lift when the Arab Street erupts. The fact that Saudi Arabia has a very ‘awkward neighbourhood’, with deep seated problems in Bahrain, Yemen and Iraq hardly helps its own Eastern Province either. Forget ‘Arab Spring’; think ‘Salafist Séance’. 2) Risk: Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices Holding things together in the Middle East will in large part depend on maintaining high oil prices in the first place. Given likely Eurozone failures, a realisation that the U.S. debt position is unsustainable, and daunting domestic challenges in India, Brazil and China to head off hard landings, then demand side fundamentals all point towards two digit oil prices. Having made over 1.115trillion in 2012, you could be excused for thinking OPEC would have ample wiggle room to buy themselves more political time; not so. 100/b is no longer deemed expensive across OPEC ranks, but a necessary price for regime survival. Besides notoriously overstretched patronage states like Algeria, Nigeria, Venezuela or Iran, even Gulf States are starting to feel the pinch. There are no true price moderates left in the oil cartel, merely gradations of hawks. The geopolitical cost of survival is what matters, and it’s seriously out of sync with the geological cost of production. Bottom line: It’s 100/b or bust for petro-states. While it’s true that most recessions since the 1970s have been preceded by oil price spikes, OPEC has never been very good at heading the lessons of demand destruction, and with emerging markets dominating the headlines, it is unlikely to do better now. Most producer states will be caught seriously short if this happens. Russia will be first out of the money, Central Asian budgets will be squeezed and MENA producers will have to make uncomfortable trade-offs. Latin America is in no better shape, no matter whether you look at Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador or indeed Brazil. In a back to (conventional) basics scenario, the bulk of producer states will go for volume over price, in the hope that the Saudis will do the heavy lifting to set a viable floor. Riyadh might play ball for a while, but it’s unlikely to stop producer states reverting to what they know best as a short term coping mechanism: ‘blunt repression’. Whether that works or not remains to be seen, but if nothing else, we could see a ‘2013 paradox’ of heightened instability across producer states underpinning prices as panic sets in. Pleasant OPEC meetings in Vienna will be irrelevant to the political unrest sweeping producer states. ‘Cyclical’ will take on a whole new meaning as far price and political instability is concerned – the lower the price, the more likely we will see supply disruptions as more vulnerable producers opt for a Libyan or Syrian course. Watch out for Iraq on that score; Kurdish plays look good right now, but Baghdad is unlikely to give up the Northern ghost without a fight – Sunni factions could easily get caught in the crossfire. 3) Ruse: Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head Amid all this, Iran will be the nuclear dog that doesn’t bark. Sanctions will remain in place, with the U.S. turning the screw a little harder around June presidential elections in Tehran. The Iranian’s will increase their bluster around the Strait of Hormuz in response, not to mention continuing to vie for regional influence across the Gulf, and especially in Syria, Bahrain and Iraq. But for all the huffing and puffing in Washington and Tehran, the nuclear question will remain a stalemate. As long as Iran can find Eastern outlets for its crude, the only way the nuclear clock is stopped is by impatience, miscalculation or misreading of intent that prompts somebody (aka Tel Aviv), to hazard a high risk first move. That’s an unlikely prospect given the political factors in play, Iran will be deferred to 2014 or 2015. Traders who don’t ‘get that’; expect to get burnt. 4) Rumbler: Russia Goes To Internal Energy War Classically Russian, but in the midst of extreme market uncertainty, the main wars they’ll be fighting are internal between Rosneft and Gazprom. It’s quite clear after the TNK-BP deal that Rosneft has become the new national champion of choice, producing up to 4.6mb/d (taking overall state control of hydrocarbon output to over 50%). How well Rosneft performs remains to be seen, as does the amount of international capital Russia can attract into Arctic plays, but it’s Gazprom that’s the canary in the Moscow mineshaft here. After pursuing endless political goals such as Nord Stream (and nascent South Stream pipelines), Gazprom failed to respond to the most fundamental ‘fundamental’ of all; the unconventional gas world developing around them. To remain a ‘market maker’ rather than price taker, Gazprom had to get out of petty pipeline politics and into serious quantities of LNG. That never happened, and with most Russian fields now looking horribly expensive to develop, Gazprom will need to fork out over 45bn per anum over the next five years. That doesn’t bode particularly well for the Kremlin to fall back on gas revenues, especially if shale plays and LNG continue to cut international market share. Gazprom only contributes 7% of total state revenues, a figure that will be squeezed into 2013. But the competition isn’t just coming from overseas, but directly from Rosneft. Igor Sechin’s outfit has already secured a 25 year gas supply agreement with Inter RAO (the state electricity provider), next stop will be going after Gazprom’s gas export monopoly. That spells trouble for Gazprom, and indeed private players such as Novatak. Gazprom gets left holding the European baby, playing regional pipeline politics, while Rosneft performs a global energy role. As the battle unfolds, expect Russian production to suffer in the interim and for Moscow to fall back on its free-rider role wherever possible. Hostilities will be brutal, but Rosneft is likely to be the long term winner. Civil war is an ugly thing, and especially so in Russia. 5) Rumbling Risk: American Schizophrenia Sets In Then we have America. It’s been the trail blazer for shale gas gains over the past decade, and’s increasingly replicating the ‘revolution’ for liquids. As everyone knows, U.S. shale gas gains have turned gas into a perennial buyers’ market, so much so that henry hub prices have become a victim of their own success. The key question in 2013 is not whether America will maintain its number one (650bcm) gas slot, but how much it intends to export as LNG? Those expecting the floodgates to open next year could be disappointed; any volumes signed off in Washington will keep a very keen eye on domestic prices. Of the 125bcm/y of LNG trains awaiting FERC approval, 40-50bcm would be remarkably good going. But even if America gets cold LNG feet, price convergence will slowly continue to play out across the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. The mere prospect of U.S. liquidity hitting the market has been seized upon by Asian buyers, with the upshot that Washington’s virtual impact on the gas world will be far larger than its physical presence in 2013. That’s not particularly great news for global energy companies trying to develop expensive LNG projects in West Africa, East Africa and Australia, but as the old adage from abundant energy goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’. Qatar and Russia serve as the perfect case in point, rueing the slow, but painful death of oil indexed prices for gas. In terms of liquids, America will probably push towards 11.5mb/d production next year. That means very different things to different people. It’s ‘energy independence nirvana’ for some, especially those willing to lump the Americas all under a single Washington production figure. When President Obama signs off the Keystone XI pipeline in 2013 the narrative will gain far greater traction, even though it’s actually the first step towards fixing WTI prices back towards international benchmarks. That’s chilling news for OPEC of course, not because America can play any kind of swing producer role, but because of the collateral damage it will do to oil prices. Where things get considerably worse for the cartel, is not only that the Americas will use Washington as a production hedge to send tankers East, (Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico all know that relying on a single source of supply and single source of demand is a no brainer), but that Beijing will continue to go ‘long’ in the Americas to make sure they remain firmly tied into global energy markets. Just as China is strategically investing in any cost overruns on LNG plays right now, it’s going to do exactly the same for liquids. Why? Because China wins most from a cheap and abundant energy world. 2013 will mark a transitional step towards that outcome; the vexed Nexen deal will be the watershed moment underpinning Chimerica’s physical and virtual stake in the game. But a word of caution for Beijing, political risk is just as lethal, if not more so in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Just ask BP. 6) Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind The perceived U.S. upside from its energy gains is that it no longer has to do all the heavy lifting for global energy supplies. True enough; but the blunt fact to consider is that two-thirds of global oil supplies are still sitting on politically shaky ground, and doing so in an increasingly large external power vacuum in the Middle East. The vacuum will get significantly bigger as US power (and interest) ebbs and Chinese oil flows, albeit without overarching political or security guarantees in place. It also had the distinct potential for conflict should Washington and Beijing end up misreading each other’s actions. Both of whom remain OPEC price takers at this stage. Summary:","response":"The top energy risks for 2013 include the following: 1) The Middle East and North Africa unrest and secession struggles, which revolve around political secession and may lead to a rise in oil prices. 2) Producer states might overreact to falling oil prices, with many countries such as Russia, Central Asian nations, and Latin America facing increased pressure on budgets. 3) The Iranian nuclear situation could come to a head, though it is expected to remain a stalemate with sanctions in place. 4) Russia's internal energy war between Rosneft and Gazprom, with Rosneft becoming the new national champion of choice. 5) The United States shale gas gains and potential LNG exports, though limited amounts are expected to be signed off next year. 6) The perceived shift in U.S. and Chinese roles in global energy supplies, with 2/3 of global oil supplies sitting on politically shaky ground. These risks underpin the uncertainties in the energy world going into 2013."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Bug Review: This movie really bugged me (pun intended).

The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi, (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (genos) to be Hellenic. There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman millet system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Greek Orthodox protector, the Russian Empire, or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-Christian. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as Greek Muslims - excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the devshirme - were to be found in Crete (Cretan Turks), Greek Macedonia (for example among the Vallahades of western Macedonia), and among Pontic Greeks in the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands. Several Ottoman sultans and princes were also of part Greek origin, with mothers who were either Greek concubines or princesses from Byzantine noble families, one famous example being sultan Selim the Grim, whose mother Gülbahar Hatun was a Pontic Greek.

This group was not based on language or where you were from, but on being part of the Orthodox Church. So, if you were an Orthodox Christian, the Ottoman Empire would call you a Greek, even if you spoke another language or came from a different place. This was because religion was the main way to group people together during that time. But remember, being part of this group also meant you were not treated as well as the Muslims in the Ottoman Empire."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A man gets air time on his wakeboard.\\" that \\"The man is playing golf.\\"?

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When I'm in trouble, I always take out a book and read quietly. I put my heart into it so that I'll forget all the troubles. I've formed the habit of reading in this way. When I was a little boy, I was interested in picture books and storybooks. When I was a middle school student, I began to read novels, plays, essays and so on. I found I could get much from them. Little by little I took great interest in literature and last term I won the first prize in the composition contest among middle school students in our city. Reading The Emperor's New Clothes, I had to let out a burst of laughter over his silly action. The Little Match Girl couldn't keep me from crying for her misery . Robinson Crusoe took me into a strange world full of danger. And I was also deeply impressed by Helen Keller's perseverance . Besides these, books also tell me other things -- how to be a brave man and how to tell the difference between the right and the wrong. In a word, good books can make me know what I didn't know before. So I think of good books as my best friends. I'll never forget this famous saying, \\"Good books are the best friends who never turn their backs upon us.\\" Question: What does the writer think of the emperor in the story The Emperor's New Clothes? Answer: A:","response":"The writer perceives the emperor in the story \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" as silly. This is evident from the mention of having to let out a burst of laughter over the emperor's silly action, which highlights the amusement and absurdity the writer finds in the character's behavior. The story is a well-known tale that revolves around an emperor who is tricked into wearing \\"invisible\\" clothes, only to realize later that he is parading around naked in front of his subjects. This silly situation provides the writer with comical relief and entertainment through reading."},{"question":"Concepts: city, map, route Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"A map shows the different parts of a city and helps us find the best route to get from one place to another."},{"question":"Use some thinking to answer the following question. A pipe can fill a cistern in 20 minutes whereas the cistern when fill can be emptied by a leak in 70 minutes. When both pipes are opened, find when the cistern will be full? Options: (A) 17 minutes (B) 87 minutes (C) 70 minutes (D) 28 minutes (E) 11 minutes","response":"Let's analyze this problem step by step. 1. A pipe can fill a cistern in 20 minutes. This means that the rate of filling the cistern by the pipe is 1/20 of the cistern's capacity per minute. 2. The cistern when full can be emptied by a leak in 70 minutes. This means that the rate of emptying the cistern by the leak is 1/70 of the cistern's capacity per minute. 3. When both pipes are opened, we need to find when the cistern will be full. To do this, we'll subtract the rate of emptying from the rate of filling: (1/20 - 1/70) of the cistern's capacity per minute. To calculate this expression, we'll have to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 20 and 70 to combine the fractions: LCM(20,70) = 140 Now we can combine the fractions: (1/20 - 1/70) = (7/140 - 2/140) = 5/140 This means that, when both pipes are opened, the net rate of filling the cistern will be 5/140 of the cistern's capacity per minute. Now we'll have to find out how long it will take for the cistern to be completely full at this net rate: 1 cistern / (5/140) per minute = 140/5 minutes = 28 minutes So, the cistern will be full in 28 minutes when both the filling pipe and the leak are opened. Therefore, the correct answer is: (D) 28 minutes"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Sacha Baron Cohen is a British comedian, actor, writer, and producer who is known for his unique style which includes creating fictional characters and personas. Born on October 13, 1971, in London, United Kingdom, Sacha Baron Cohen gained fame with his television series \\"Da Ali G Show\\" in which he portrayed various characters, including the titular Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, and Brüno Gehard. He later brought some of these characters to the big screen in movies such as \\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\\" (2006), \\"Brüno\\" (2009), and \\"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\\" (2020). Cohen lent his distinctive voice to the character of King Julien XIII, a hilarious and self-absorbed ring-tailed lemur, in the Madagascar animated film series. The franchise includes several installments, such as \\"Madagascar\\" (2005), \\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\\" (2008), and \\"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\\" (2012). In addition to the movies, King Julien's character also appeared in various spin-offs, like \\"The Penguins of Madagascar\\" series, and had a standalone series titled \\"All Hail King Julien.\\" However, it's worth noting that Sacha Baron Cohen did not provide the voice for King Julien in the spin-offs or \\"All Hail King Julien\\" series. In those productions, actor Danny Jacobs took over the role and continued to provide the voice for the character. Jacobs did such an excellent job of capturing Cohen's portrayal that many audience members might not have noticed the switch. In summary, Sacha Baron Cohen is the acclaimed actor who provided the voice for King Julien in the Madagascar film series, bringing his comedic talents and unique vocal stylings to the beloved character."},{"question":"(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people.

It covers an area of about 179 square kilometers (69 square miles) and has a population of around 106,000 people. The capital of Aruba is Oranjestad, a vibrant city that serves as the island's hub for commerce, tourism, and culture. Aruba has a rich history that includes colonization by the Dutch in the early 17th century. The Dutch established their presence on the island in 1636 when they claimed possession of it from the indigenous Caquetio Indians. They ruled Aruba for over two centuries under the jurisdiction of the Dutch West India Company until it became a colony of the Netherlands in 1815. During the 20th century, Aruba began to seek greater autonomy from the Netherlands. In 1954, it achieved a certain degree of self-government as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which also included the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands. In 1986, Aruba decided to separate from the Netherlands Antilles, becoming a separate and autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. There were initial plans for Aruba to gain complete independence by 1996, but the process was halted in 1990 due to concerns about the island's economic stability and sustainability. Since then, Aruba has maintained its status as a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands but continues to steadily move towards greater autonomy and potentially full independence. In recent years, there has been an increased push for self-determination, with various political parties and movements advocating for more control over the island's natural resources, environment, and economic policies. The issue of independence remains a topic of debate among the Aruban population, balancing the potential benefits of complete self-governance against the costs and uncertainties of disconnecting from the Dutch support system. While Aruba has not yet achieved complete independence, it continues to cultivate its unique identity, culture, and political system, which could shape the island's future relationship with the Netherlands. In conclusion, the island of Aruba is a former Dutch colony with its capital at Oranjestad that continues to move slowly towards independence. As a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba has been gradually asserting more of its autonomy and self-governance over the past decades. With an evolving political landscape and an ongoing debate on the benefits and challenges of full independence, Aruba's future remains a subject of discussion and interest."},{"question":"Two signatures. That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Hometown of Mayor Dan Reed looks forward to each year with enthusiasm to all the events, friends and family that fill this special season. Together with his brother Greg, they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright, a mean-spirited and embittered militant atheist returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious. Mitch is a highly successful big city lawyer who has never wanted anything to do with Trapper Falls. The rivalry re-ignites when the frustrated Mitch takes offense to what he sees as the town's violation of his rights. Mitch wants the Nativity scene removed from the front of City hall and the word Christmas switched to Happy Holidays on all signs. Fifty years of tradition are now challenged not by an outsider, but a former member of the community.

I give it a tie, with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early Thirties musicals. Although the movie clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line. And what's the story line? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney) who produces musicals, and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over. He starts doing Prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts. He gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them, moving them around the country. He's a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things. But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise-cracking secretary, loves him but he's too busy too notice; an office girl in black-rimmed, round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all; a blonde gold-digger is setting her hooks in him; his partners are cheating him...my gosh, what's next? This may all sound like a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, with Cagney bouncing, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it's done. Instead of \\"Let's put on a show, gang\\" we have \\"We need to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing.\\" These three super Prologues are going to feature 40 chorines, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty Kent units in deluxe movie houses...the whole Apollo movie house circuit! Exhaustion threatens, feet ache, but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour; you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic) stay the course, dancing their hearts out, giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty. And then the curtains go up as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses, one after the other on the same night, with the owner of the Apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save Chester's skin or not. First up is \\"Honeymoon Hotel\\" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some might even be married), bedrooms and beds, and doors with \\"Do not disturb\\" signs. Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of \\"By a Waterfall\\" that probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy. This number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with waterslides, a giant pool -- you'd never think there was a Depression on. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks -- synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things -- and he does it in the water, with a lot of underwater photography looking up. The girls are sure game. They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a couple of quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks a bit cautious.

There's Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar, dancing on a table, Cagney fighting. There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines, hupping back and forth, rifles tossed and caught.

Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along.

Babe is not aware of his brother's true occupation.Doc is often supposedly out of the country on business for extended periods of time but comes to New York under the guise of a visit to Babe. The brother of a Nazi war criminal possesses a safety deposit box key, but is killed in a traffic accident (after a road rage altercation with a short tempered middle-aged Jewish American motorist). Doc suspects that the criminal, Dr. Christian Szell (Laurence Olivier) will be arriving to retrieve an extremely valuable diamond collection. Szell later sends a burly assassin named Chen (James Wing Woo) to kill Doc in his Paris hotel room, but Doc fights the hit man and breaks his back.Babe enters into a relationship with a young woman named Elsa Opel (Marthe Keller), who claims to be from Switzerland. One night while out on a date Elsa and Babe are mugged in a park by two men dressed in suits.

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

Every Sunday John is allowed to watch cartoons. However, for every 10 minutes of cartoons, he has to do 8 minutes of chores. If he watches cartoons for 2 hours, how many minutes of chores does he have to do?","response":"Step 1: Convert hours to minutes John watches cartoons for 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes of cartoons. Step 2: Calculate the proportion between cartoons and chores For every 10 minutes of cartoons, John has to do 8 minutes of chores. To find out how many total chores he has to do, we need to calculate the proportion between the time he watches cartoons and the time he spends on chores. The proportion is 8 minutes of chores per 10 minutes of cartoons. Step 3: Determine the total amount of chores based on the proportion Using the proportion calculated in step 2, we can now find out how many minutes of chores John has to do based on the 120 minutes of cartoons he watches. To do this, we can set up a simple equation: (8 minutes of chores / 10 minutes of cartoons) = x minutes of chores / 120 minutes of cartoons. Step 4: Solve for x Cross-multiplying the equation, we get: 8 * 120 = 10 * x Simplifying the equation, we have: 960 = 10x Dividing both sides by 10, we get the final answer: x = 96 minutes of chores.

The attacker, only described as wearing a black shirt and blue pants, was the subject of a broad search Sunday by the sheriff's departments of Calaveras and surrounding counties, the California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Justice. Eight-year-old Leila Fowler was stabbed to death on Saturday at the home in Valley Springs, Coroner Kevin Raggio said. The town has about 2,500 people. \\"This is way too close to home,\\" Julia Poland, who took her 13-year-old daughter to an afternoon news conference on the search, told the Modesto Bee. \\"This kind of thing does not happen here.\\" Leila was found by her brother _ reported by local media to be 12-years-old _ after he encountered a male intruder in the home. When the intruder ran away, the boy found his sister stabbed. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital, officials said. Authorities spent Saturday night and into Sunday conducting a door-to-door sweep of homes scattered across hilly terrain, checking storage sheds and horse stables, and even searching attics. \\"It is a difficult area to search, it's rural, remote,\\" sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said. Mass notifications alerted residents about the incident and the search for the suspect, officials said. \\"I was working on my tractor and a CHP copter kept flying over my house,\\" area resident Roger Ballew, 35, told The Associated Press on Sunday. A SWAT team showed up at his house Saturday night and told him to stay inside, Ballew said. \\"It was nerve-wracking, I didn't sleep well,\\" he said. Investigators on Sunday were interviewing several people, but no suspects had been named by late afternoon. Investigators were checking out tips that had come in to the sheriff's office, including leads and tips that came from outside the county, officials said. \\"It's just terrible,\\" area resident Paul Gschweng told Sacramento television station KCRA. \\"What can I say about it, it's just a tragedy.\\" The station reported that a neighbor told police that a man was running from the girl's home after the incident. Investigators were asking area residents to call authorities if they had any information, or knew of anyone who may have unexplained injuries, or may have left the area unexpectedly after the girl was killed. Valley Springs is a community of about 2,500 people in an unincorporated area of Calaveras County, known as \\"Gold Country,\\" in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento. The county became world-famous in 1865 with Mark Twain's short story, \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\\" according to the Calaveras County Chamber of Commerce website. ||||| CALAVERAS COUNTY- Schools in the Calaveras Unified School District will be open Monday, two days after 8-year-old Leila Fowler was stabbed to death in her Valley Springs home. Mark Campbell, the district’s superintendent, said in a statement Sunday, “As we all grapple with the tragic and senseless loss of one of our own, we do so knowing that we will be ready to do what is necessary to provide a safe environment for students and for staff, and to stand unified and strong as we provide whatever level of support and assistance that is necessary to help the family, our students, our parents and our staff process the unthinkable.” Campbell added that counselors will be on hand at Jenny Lind Elementary, Toyon Middle School and Calaveras High School. There will also be an added law enforcement presence at Jenny Lind elementary and bus stops nearby. ||||| — The Calaveras County coroner's office has released the cause of death for 8-year-old Leila Fowler. Deputy coroner Steve Moore said she died from shock and hemorrhaging from multiple stab wounds. Moore said Leila arrived by ambulance at Mark Twain Medical Center in San Andreas at 12:55 p.m. Saturday and was pronounced dead at 1:01 p.m. Moore declined to release more details. On Monday, the Sheriff's Department scaled back its massive manhunt for the man suspected of fatally stabbing Leila at her Rancho Calaveras home over the weekend. Leila was a third-grader at Jenny Lind Elementary School in Valley Springs. Friends described her as a child with a smile that would melt anyone's heart and a winning personality, and as a daddy's girl who loved the color purple. Sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said Leila's family has asked the public to help catch her killer by reporting anything relevant to a tip line at (209) 754-6030. Leila's slaying has rocked Valley Springs and Rancho Calaveras, two small towns a couple of miles apart along Highways 12 and 26 and by New Hogan Lake. A few dozen anxious and frustrated people turned out Sunday afternoon for a news conference at the sheriff's Valley Springs substation for an update. \\"This is way too close to home. This kind of thing does not happen here,\\" said Julia Poland, who brought her 13-year-old daughter, KyLee, to the news conference. Authorities said a white or Latino man attacked Leila at her Rippon Road home early Saturday afternoon. Leila's 12-year-old brother told investigators he encountered the man, who fled on foot, and then discovered his sister. Macedo said the boy called his parents, who were nearby, and then called 911. The parents also called 911. Leila was taken to a hospital in Calaveras County, where she was pronounced dead. Authorities called residents of Rippon Road and other nearby streets and asked them to lock their doors and windows and stay inside as officers launched a search for the child killer. Officers searched houses, attics, crawl spaces, sheds, outbuildings and tall grass Saturday afternoon and through the night. Authorities closed part of Rippon Road and other nearby streets, although residents were able to come and go. The search continued through Sunday afternoon. Macedo, the sheriff's captain, said searchers found fingerprints and what they believe to be DNA evidence in the girl's home and hope to have lab results back within a week. Macedo declined to release many details of the homicide, saying he did not want to jeopardize the investigation. He could not say when the search would end, saying it would depend on the leads officers developed from their interviews and the search. Details on search areas beyond the neighborhood were not available. Macedo said officers from several nearby sheriff's departments, including Tuolumne and San Joaquin, as well as the California Highway Patrol and the Angels Camp Police Department were helping in the manhunt. Searchers brought in dogs and search and rescue volunteers. The slaying took place in a hilly, rural neighborhood that residents described as quiet and safe, with large homes typically built on one-acre lots. They said most of the homeowners are retirees or workers who commute to jobs in the Northern San Joaquin Valley or Bay Area. Rancho Calaveras is about 30 miles east of Stockton. Residents said they moved to Rancho Calaveras to escape the crime and violence that have become commonplace in their former hometowns. Leila has a brother who is a sixth-grader at Jenny Lind, another brother who attends Toyon Middle School and a sister who attends Calaveras High School, said Mark Campbell, superintendent of the Calaveras Unified School District.

Article: Most people are aware of what the adoption process is because it has become rather common in our society. Adoption is where a child is legally placed with guardians or parents (or perhaps a single parent) other than the birth mother or father. Once an adoption is finalized, all parental rights are turned over to the adoptive parents and there is no legal difference between adoptive parents and natural birth parents. There are generally two types of adoption, which are closed adoption and open adoption. When an adopted person has access to his or her adoption file and original records, it is referred to as an open adoption. The term is also used to describe any contact that may be between the adoptive family, the birth parents, and the adopted child. The level of openness can change greatly in such contact depending on each individual relationship. There can be indirect contact between the natural birth parents and the child through the form of letters and photographs, or there can be actual physical contact. A semi-open adoption is where the birth parents may have contact with the adoptive parents before the birth of the child, either once or several times. After the birth there is no more contact. A semi-open adoption may remain as it is or it can become either open or closed. A closed adoption is where only the medical and historical information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive family. Typically, the birth and adoptive parents do not know each other's identities. The record of the birth parents is kept sealed . A closed adoption is usually only effective in the adoption of babies. The adoption of an older child who already knows his or her birth parents cannot be kept closed. Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE about the closed adoption? Options: A: The birth parents may have indirect contact with the adoptive parents. B: The biological parents may often go to see their birth child. C: No information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive parents. D: Generally speaking, the adoptive parents do not know the birth parents' identities.

At the office Willard is constantly belittled by Martin, finding understanding from Joan Simms (Sondra Locke).At home there is the celebration of his birthday, Charlotte Stassen (Jody Gilbert) and the rest of his mom's friends nag him about being more aggressive and going for an executive job, although Henrietta thinks that he wouldn't have been able to take charge of the business. He is nagged by his mother, particularly to kill some rats she has seen in their backyard. In the process of exterminating the rats, Willard saves them and finds as he feeds and plays with them that he can train the animals, by feeding them, and setting himself in their instincts as a rescuer. He baits the rats onto a pillar in the center of a well, and removes the wood bridge that they crossed. Then, as he fills the well, they are frantic, and he replaces the wood bridge; thus he cements their allegiance, and, in effect communicates with them. Meanwhile, Charlotte appears to take care of Henrietta, who falls sick and is an annoyingly meddlesome woman.The mother rat, whose life Willard saved, brings one of her off-spring to him. Willard learns that through Socrates, as he has named his pet, he can order the others in the pack to do his bidding, except for the mischievous Ben, who occasionally disobeys.

The great part about kissing is that you’re taking time away from the world to enjoy your partner. You don’t need to scramble into things like the world is about to end. In all honesty, you will probably find it to be much more romantic and rewarding if you take the time to explore each other than if you kiss super fast and chaotically. Try it. This is a great technique for romantic kissing. As you are kissing normally, pull back just slightly and see how the other person responds. If they follow you then you can continue kissing, and potentially even push them forward very slightly back in the other direction. However, this maneuver works best if you create a slight separation between your lips. This manufactures of a moment of romance, with your lips only slightly apart and your bodies close together. This should be a natural position. While you are kissing your lips are generally slightly parted and you aren’t always meeting your partners lips directly head on. Aim for the lower lip and then before pulling away suck on it a little bit or give it a tiny bite. This will feel new and exciting for your partner and it also adds some sensation. Sometimes less is more. By pecking softly, you are setting the stage for more to come and it can also be very romantic if you pause on your partners face during one of the pecks and breathe out slowly that can add to the romance. Greeting with a passionate kiss can be a nice surprise and lead into passionate kissing. The same goes for a good morning kiss or a goodbye kiss. Really there is never a bad time for a kiss, but these times can help punctuate a kiss and make it more passionate than it otherwise would have been. Try to think of romantic occasions to kiss your partner.

In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial.

By Jessica Jerreat Oprah Winfrey's former stepmother has been given more time to vacate the 1.4 million Nashville home the talk show host bought for her and her ex-husband to live in. Barbara Winfrey was married to Oprah's father Vernon for over a decade, but the bitter fight over the house has hung over the family since he filed for divorce in 2012. Following a court appearance on Monday, Barbara Winfrey now has two months to move out of the house in Franklin, Tennessee. Dispute: Barbara and Vernon Winfrey pictured in 2010. The couple divorced in 2012 A spokesman for Oprah said that the talkshow hostâ€™s company has granted Barbara 60 days to leave following her request for more time. In a messy legal dispute, Barbara claimed","response":"that Oprah had promised to provide her with the house as a permanent residence after her divorce from Vernon. She stated that the media mogul was using her financial power and influence to force her out of the home she had lived in for over ten years. However, Oprah's representatives argued that the house was always intended to be a temporary arrangement and that Barbara was aware of this agreement. As the legal battle escalated, public opinion seemed to be divided. Some sympathized with Barbara, believing that Oprah should honor her alleged promise to help her ex-stepmother with housing after the divorce. Others sided with Oprah, asserting that it was not her responsibility to provide for Barbara indefinitely, and that it was time for Barbara to move on and take care of herself. During the two months that Barbara was granted, a mediation session occurred between both parties, in an attempt to resolve their differences amicably. It has been a difficult process, involving a careful examination of the facts, testimony from both Barbara and Vernon, as well as expert analysis of the legal and financial implications of the case. Ultimately, the mediator was able to facilitate a settlement that satisfied all parties. In this settlement, Oprah agreed to provide financial assistance to Barbara for a period of two years, enabling her to secure alternate accommodation and adjust to her new life. Additionally, Oprah would cover the moving expenses and help Barbara in finding a suitable place to live. On the condition that Barbara gave up any further legal claims against Oprah or her company, the media mogul also agreed to donate a significant amount to Barbara's favorite charity. This generous donation allowed Barbara to save face and feel secure in the knowledge that her departure from the Nashville home would benefit a worthy cause. The charity would publicly recognize Barbara's role in facilitating Oprah's donation, keeping her name connected to philanthropic efforts. After weighing the pros and cons, Barbara finally agreed to the terms of the settlement, signing all necessary paperwork to finalize the deal. With this resolution in place, both parties could finally put the matter behind them and move forward from this challenging ordeal. In the months that followed, Barbara successfully found a new home and began the next chapter of her life. Oprah, meanwhile, continued her philanthropic and professional endeavors, her reputation remaining strong despite the public dispute.

Its language was similar to the Syriac language.[citation needed] The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran more than the New Testament. Muslims believe the common elements or resemblances between the Bible and other Jewish and Christian writings and Islamic dispensations is due to their common divine source,[citation needed] and that the original Christian or Jewish texts were authentic divine revelations given to prophets. Who has claimed that Christians and Jews had heard and discussed the Quran before it took on its standardized Arabic form?","response":"The claim that Christians and Jews heard and discussed the Quran before it was standardized in its Arabic form is found in some historical Islamic sources, including interpretations of certain Hadiths. One of the most prominent authoritative collection of Hadiths in Sunni Islam is \\"Sahih al-Bukhari,\\" compiled by Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari in the 9th Century. Sahih al-Bukhari is regarded as one of the most trustworthy collections of Hadith, which are accounts of the sayings or actions of the Prophet Muhammad, and serve as significant sources of Islamic theology and law. These sources indicate that the Quran, in its pre-standardized form, had been recited and even debated among different communities, including the Levantines and Iraqis, and among Jews and Christians. While it's essential to note that the Quran was revealed in Arabic, it's also relevant that its language had similarities with the Syriac language - a fact often utilized by scholars to explain why it may have been accessible to a broader audience beyond just Arab Muslims. The Quran contains numerous accounts from Jewish and Christian scriptures such as the Tanakh and the Bible, and devotional literature like the Apocrypha and Midrash, which further supports this theory. While there are distinct differences within these narratives, the Quran recounts stories of many individuals also found in these texts, including but not limited to Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus, and many others. Muslims believe in the divine source of these common elements and maintain that these resonate between the Bible, other Jewish and Christian writings, and Islamic tradition because they are all revelations given by Allah (God) to various prophets. It is relevant that even though these stories have been viewed from different angles and relayed in different languages over time, the original Christian or Jewish texts are considered by Muslims as authentic divine revelations. However, regarding the claim, it's important to note that there is ongoing academic discourse and debate. Not all scholars agree, particularly since many of these discussions inevitably involve conjecture and the interpretation of ancient texts and oral traditions that are, in many cases, not wholly definitive. Also, the original transmission of the Quran was primarily oral, which adds an additional layer of complexity to these investigations."},{"question":"Heian period: Nominally, sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact power was wielded by the Fujiwara nobility.

From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was warmly welcomed by the staff, and the ambience immediately enveloped me in an aura of sheer sophistication and elegance. Right from the start, our server, Ricky, was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. He recommended the chef's special five-course tasting menu, and after hearing the mouthwatering descriptions of each dish, we couldn't resist. Ricky also suggested a perfect wine pairing for our meal, showing an impressive understanding of not only the cuisine but also the accompanying beverages. The first course, Seared Scallops with Cauliflower Puree, set the tone for the evening. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the puree was velvety and rich. The dish was artfully plated, featuring an impressive balance of colors, textures, and flavors. Next came the second course, an exquisite Heirloom Tomato Salad with fresh burrata and a basil-lemon vinaigrette. The tomatoes were plump, juicy, and full of flavor, complemented by the creaminess of the burrata and the zesty vinaigrette. Needless to say, I savored every bite. The third course showcased a perfectly cooked Chilean Sea Bass with asparagus and sun-dried tomatoes. The sea bass was succulent and melted in my mouth, while the asparagus was crunchy and fresh, accompanied by the robustly flavored sun-dried tomatoes. It was visually stunning and absolutely delicious. Our fourth course, which happened to be my favorite, was the Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb with rosemary-garlic potatoes and mint chimichurri. The lamb was exceptionally tender, and the herbs and mint chimichurri added layers of complexity that tantalized my taste buds. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, making it a match made in heaven. Finally, we concluded our meal with a delightful Chocolate Lava Cake with raspberry coulis and fresh berries. The lava cake was oozing with warm, gooey chocolate that tantalized my senses, while the tartness of the raspberry coulis and berries perfectly cut through the richness of the chocolate. Throughout the evening, Ricky checked up on us frequently, ensuring that our glasses were always full and our questions about each dish were answered in detail. His attentiveness and charm added a personal touch to the already exceptional dining experience. Cocina De Luna has redefined fine dining for me. The exquisite flavors, impeccable presentation, and top-notch service were all part of an unforgettable experience that has me anticipating my next visit.

În limba română, acest text se traduce astfel: Am votat în favoarea acestui document, care codifică Directiva Consiliului 87/402/CEE din 25 iunie 1987 privind structurile de protecție la răsturnare montate în fața locului șoferului pe tractoare agricole și forestiere cu roți cu ecartament îngust. Această directivă abordează o problemă importantă în domeniul siguranței în munca din agricultură și silvicultură, respectiv riscul de accidente cauzate de răsturnarea tractoarelor. Un aspect crucial al Directivei 87/402/CEE este stabilirea unor cerințe tehnice și de proiectare pentru structurile de protecție la răsturnare, având în vedere faptul că ele pot salva viețile șoferilor și pot preveni rănirea gravă a acestora în caz de accident. În plus, directiva promovează uniformizarea reglementărilor privind structurile de protecție la nivel european, facilitând practicile agricole durabile și protecția mediului. Cele trei tipuri principale de structuri de protecție la răsturnare menționate în Directiva 87/402/CEE sunt structurile cadru, arce de securitate și cabină. Directiva stabilește criterii de proiectare specifică și metode de încercare pentru fiecare dintre aceste structuri, în scopul de a asigura un nivel adecvat de siguranță. Totuși, un aspect important de remarcat este faptul că Directiva 87/402/CEE nu se aplică tuturor categoriilor de tractoare, ci doar celor cu ecartament îngust. Acest lucru reflectă, de asemenea, preocuparea legiuitorului pentru a aborda problemele de siguranță într-un mod echilibrat și eficient, adaptat nevoilor și particularităților specifice ale diverselor tipuri de tractoare. În concluzie, Directiva Consiliului 87/402/CEE reprezintă un pas important în asigurarea unui mediu de lucru mai sigur pentru operatorii de tractoare agricole și forestiere cu ecartament îngust și promovarea unei abordări uniforme în ceea ce privește siguranța la răsturnare.

Answer:","response":"The question requires a combination of geographical and botanical knowledge to deduce the capital of the only triply landlocked U.S. state where Maianthemum canadense is found. Let us comprehend each part of the question separately before combining them to reach the final answer. Maianthemum canadense, also known as Canadian Mayflower or Canada Mayflower, is a native plant species found primarily in North America. It thrives in the forest understory. Its distribution ranges from East to Central Canada, extending further south into the Eastern and Central United States. A triply landlocked state refers to a geographical location where it takes at least three border crossings between states or provinces to reach a major body of water, such as an ocean. In the United States, there is only one triply landlocked state: Nebraska. Nebraska is situated within the Great Plains region of the central United States, and it takes three border crossings to reach the Gulf of Mexico in the South or the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on either coast. The state borders Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Iowa, and Missouri. It is worth noting that there is only one other triply landlocked location globally, and that is the Uzbek capital city, Tashkent. Now, combining the botanical and geographical facts, we look for the capital of Nebraska, as that is the state fitting the triply landlocked criterion mentioned in the question. Nebraska's capital city is Lincoln. Lincoln was founded in 1856 and serves as the administrative, educational, and cultural center for the state. In conclusion, the capital of the only triply landlocked U.S. state where one can find Maianthemum canadense growing is Lincoln, Nebraska."},{"question":"Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the premise and hypothesis - Premise: \\"Easier pre-Newsweek coverage\\" and \\"buzz\\" - Hypothesis: \\"Newsweek coverage\\" and \\"buzz\\" Step 2: Analyze the premise - The premise states that buzz is created primarily due to an easier time before Newsweek coverage. This implies that when something gets coverage more easily before being picked up by Newsweek, it generates buzz. Step 3: Analyze the hypothesis - The hypothesis states that Newsweek coverage, by itself, does not necessarily result in buzz. This implies that there might be factors other than Newsweek coverage that contribute more significantly to generating buzz. Step 4: Compare the premise and hypothesis - The premise addresses the relation between easier times before Newsweek coverage and buzz, while the hypothesis examines the relationship between Newsweek coverage and buzz directly. Step 5: Determine entailment - The premise does not strictly entail the hypothesis, as it is mainly speaking to occurrences before Newsweek coverage. The hypothesis focuses on the direct relationship between Newsweek coverage and buzz. However, the premise does suggest that being covered more easily before Newsweek possibly contributes more to generating buzz than Newsweek coverage itself. Conclusion: The premise \\"Easier pre-Newsweek coverage = buzz\\" does not directly entail the hypothesis \\"Newsweek coverage does not equal buzz\\" as they're considering different aspects, but it does imply that there may be a greater importance of factors outside of Newsweek coverage for generating buzz."},{"question":"Un documentar privind frumuseţile Vrelo, canionului Matka, şi imagini ale explorării din acest an este în curs şi va fi editat în Italia.

With nearly 400 people being identified, along with their email addresses, Facebook pages, and additional information, it has garnered much attention. Although this list from Anonymous doesn't include the previously promised 1,000 names or those of politicians, it does reveal a few retired law enforcement officers. The following article aims to delve deeper into this shadowy world and explore the context, implications, and potential fallout of this event. Anonymous and Operation KKK: Operation KKK is an initiative by Anonymous to combat and expose the KKK in response to a local Klan chapter threatening violence during protests in Ferguson. The list released on Thursday is the result of 11 months of intensive research and \\"digital espionage\\" using various tactics to unearth the alleged members of the hate group. According to Engadget, Anonymous managed to trick some people into admitting their KKK affiliation while chatting online. In the words of Operation KKK, \\"You never know who you are talking to on the internet.\\" This highlights the strategy and tactics used by Anonymous in revealing these individuals. The List: The list, although shorter than expected, is primarily composed of various alleged KKK members' personal information, minus any politicians mentioned in an earlier, widely discredited list. However, some retired law enforcement officers find themselves among those featured on Anonymous's exposé. These aspects of the list prompt further questions and investigations. One significant aspect of the list is the inclusion of popular online hangouts for KKK members, where they likely coordinate efforts and discuss their objectives. This serves as an additional insight into the world of the KKK, offering opportunities for further research and counteraction. Consequences and Reactions: Anonymous stands firm in its belief that releasing this list is a critical form of resistance against the hate group. The statement from Operation KKK reads, \\"We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history.\\" While some names initially mentioned in the non-Anonymous list were found to be misleading, Operation KKK tweeted that several other names had been removed \\"for further investigation,\\" according to Raw Story. As a result, there might be potential updates to the list in the future. Initial reactions to the list have been mixed – some appreciate the efforts of Anonymous in unmasking the KKK members, while others criticize the public exposure of individuals, especially given the still unconfirmed status of some of the identities. The potential backlash against the named individuals, if found incorrect, could also have legal and social implications for Anonymous. Conclusion: Overall, the release of the alleged KKK members' list by Anonymous highlights the ongoing power struggle between hate groups and online activists. As Anonymous continues their efforts in combating the KKK through digital means, the evolving nature of online activism becomes all the more significant, with potentially far-reaching consequences in this digital age. It remains to be seen if this action will bring about positive change or further entrench the divisions and animosity between groups."},{"question":"What would be an example of an negative review?","response":"A negative review is when someone shares their not-so-happy experience with something, like a toy, a movie, or a restaurant.

Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. Which village was more thoughtful about the environment? Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","response":"Davin village"},{"question":"Given the question: Jordan never got a driver's license and made other people drive for him.

However, assuming a general context, the most salient words can be outlined as follows: 1. \\"Patterns\\": 'Patterns' is a crucial word in the sentence, as it sets up a significant characteristic of the images that are being referenced. The term 'pattern' means a repeated decorative design, implying that there is a recurring motif or theme in the decoration of the wall. It can also suggest symmetry, repetition, or discernible order in the design, which can have implications in art, design, psychology and more. 2. \\"Flowers\\": This word can serve as the core of the visual image the sentence creates. 'Flowers' brings a strong visual aspect to the sentence, and refers to the specific design theme of the patterns. It indicates that the recurring design involves flowers, implying a natural, aesthetic, or perhaps even a colorful theme. Flowers universally symbolize beauty, life, and nature. Therefore, 'flowers' largely dictates what the patterns look like and contribute to understanding what the wall might represent. 3. \\"Wall\\": Lastly, 'wall' identifies where these floral patterns exist. A wall can mean a physical boundary, but it can also be symbolic of a canvas for art or an architectural element. This hints at a broader context surrounding the pattern of flowers, whether this context is a specific room, building, or type of space (like a garden or a home), or a metaphorical or emotional context (for instance, a 'wall' of emotion or memory). In a nutshell, these three words together set the scene, the subject, and the thematic design in the sentence. Understanding their salience or significance helps enrich our understanding of the sentence in terms of its descriptive, symbolic, or metaphorical implications."},{"question":"POMPANO BEACH (CBSMiami) — A 19-year old is behind bars accused of stealing from the elderly including a World War II veteran. The Broward Sheriff’s Office says Eric Vanyo not only stole from his victims — like 93 year old Dan Thomas — but he is accused of committing the crimes while his victims were sleeping. Dan Thomas is still incredulous that Vanyo allegedly stole the 70-year old wedding ring right off his hand while he slept one night last month. “While I was asleep in bed,” Thomas said, incredulously. CLICK HERE to watch Carey Codd’s report Detectives say Vanyo lived in Thomas’ neighborhood and broke in through Thomas’ laundry room door. Thomas said he knew something was wrong when he woke up and looked around his home. “The two medicine cabinets in the bathroom were open,” Thomas said. “I never leave them open. That door to the washroom was open. I never leave that open.” BSO says Vanyo burglarized Thomas a few weeks before the August incident and also burglarized another sleeping neighbor. Thomas’ son, James, is glad his father, a decorated World War II veteran, was not hurt. He wants Vanyo to face a serious punishment. “I’m just happy they caught the guy,” James Thomas said. “I’d rather have him buried than in jail but as long as he’s in jail permanently, I’ll be happy. As long as he quits bothering other people.” Thomas got his ring back. He said it’s an ongoing reminder of his late wife. BSO says the pawn shop where Vanyo sold it made Thomas pay to recover it. For now, Thomas feels safe in his longtime home with a security system in place but he says he doesn’t have the freedom he once did. “Now I’m home in my house and I’m not free,” Thomas said. “I’m locked in. I’m just like being in jail. It’s a different life now than it was a month ago.” Jail records show the suspect Vanyo is in the Broward County Jail without bond. The Broward Sheriff’s Office says they are actively investigating whether Vanyo has done this to anyone else. RELATED CONTENT: ||||| POMPANO BEACH — After serving four years in the Army during World War II, Dan Thomas had only 500 to his name. The then-23-year-old used that money to give his high school sweetheart a wedding they could cherish forever, including a ring for her and a ring for him. Years later, Thomas would replace his wife's ring; however, the same gold band from their 1944 wedding remained on his finger, untouched, for 70 years. That is, until a robber crept into the 93-year-old's bedroom last month and stole the ring, which acts as a reminder of his wife, who died seven years ago. \\"I got robbed,\\" Thomas said. \\"How do you put it? A band given to you by your wife – it means a lot to me. Somehow [the robber] got this ring off my finger while I was asleep. My hands are very arthritic. I still can't understand how [the robber] got it off there without waking me up. I guess I'll never know that.\\" According to the Broward Sheriff's Office, Eric Vanyo, of Pompano Beach, pried open the door to Thomas' laundry room and stole a television, power tools and the ring. The 19-year-old convicted felon was arrested Thursday in connection with the Aug. 6 burglary, as well as two other similar crimes. It was the second time Vanyo had burglarized Thomas' house in the 600 block of Northeast 23rd Court, detectives said. He is also accused of prying open the window of the master bedroom on July 22, cutting himself as the window shattered, while Thomas slept. Once inside, Vanyo took a gold ring with the letter \\"D,\\" a watch and two rolls of quarters from the victim's dining room, as well as other items with sentimental value. That same night, Vanyo also broke into the nearby residence of Finas Geller through a laundry room window, detectives said. Geller, 93, was asleep when Vanyo walked into her bedroom. She woke up to see him at the foot of her bed, rummaging through dresser drawers. He fled with several pieces of costume jewelry. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"A 19-year-old boy named Eric Vanyo has been arrested for stealing from elderly people while they were sleeping, including from a 93-year-old World War II veteran named Dan Thomas.

Answer:","response":"Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating User Experience Review: I've been using the \\"com.google.android.marvin.talkback\\" app for a week now, and I firmly believe it deserves nothing more than a 1-star rating. The app falls drastically short of providing its promised accessibility support for users with visual impairments. Firstly, the user interface is extremely confusing, and the poor navigation options make the app-use a nightmare. The button placements are counterintuitive and the awkward gesture controls hinder the app's overall usability. Secondly, the app's performance is lackluster, as it frequently crashes, freezes, and often fails to respond to user input. This severely disrupts the user experience and forces the visually impaired user to constantly restart the app. Moreover, the speech output is somewhat incoherent, making it difficult to understand the content being read aloud. The voice has poor intonation, and there's a disconcerting delay between when a user selects an item and when the app starts the text-to-speech function. To make matters worse, customer support is virtually non-existent, with no immediate assistance available, and emails taking ages to get responses (if one is even lucky to receive one). Users are thus left to fend for themselves when facing issues with the app. Overall, I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with the \\"com.google.android.marvin.talkback\\" app. It has failed miserably in its primary function of aiding visually impaired users to enjoy a seamless and efficient mobile experience.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: Life can often become overwhelming, and we tend to focus on our work and responsibilities, and at times, our health takes the back seat. Many overlook the importance of physical activity in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, instead deeming it unnecessary or time-consuming. However, multiple studies have shown that incorporating even a small amount of daily exercise can lead to significant improvements in our overall health and well-being. Exercise enhances cardiovascular health, reduces stress, and improves cognitive function. These benefits extend to mental health as well, as exercising regularly has been proven to alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms and boost mood. Furthermore, staying active can help prevent chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Even moderate exercise such as walking, jogging, or yoga can yield considerable health advantages, making it easily accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels. Workout routines don't need to be time-consuming or strenuous. Allocating 30 minutes a day for some form of physical activity is a feasible commitment for most people.

North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels.

While it is essential to acknowledge the broad spectrum of gender identities, the fact mentioned focuses on aggression displayed primarily by males during mating season. - Bears: Like moles, bears are a species, not a gender. However, male bears are known to show aggression during mating season, further emphasizing that males are generally more aggressive. - Female: While there may be some instances where females display aggression during mating season, the fact given specifically states that males are very aggressive during this time. Therefore, it is more likely that males will cause harm or pain. - Birds: Birds are another species, not a gender. Some bird species may also exhibit aggression during mating season, but this again does not answer the question of which gender is more aggressive. - Gender Fluid: This term applies to individuals whose gender identity fluctuates over time.

Here's an example of such a task, which can be broken down into step-by-step approach: Task: Design an experiment to test the effect of different materials on the time it takes for a pendulum to complete a full swing. Step 1: Formulate a hypothesis Before starting the experiment, we need to make predictions about how different materials might affect the time it takes for a pendulum to complete a full swing. This requires understanding physical concepts like force, mass, and energy. Step 2: Gather necessary materials and design the experiment Collect materials such as different types of strings (e.g., nylon, cotton, fishing wire), a stopwatch, a protractor, and a weight of consistent mass. The pendulum should be able to swing freely back and forth. Ensure that the weight and the length of the strings stay constant for all trials, but vary the material of the string. Step 3: Set up the pendulum Attach one end of the first string to a steady support (such as a hook or clamp), and the other end to the weight. Adjust the string's length so that it's the same for all trials. Use the protractor to release the pendulum at a consistent angle for each trial. Step 4: Perform the experiment For each string type, release the pendulum and use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes to complete a full swing. Repeat the process multiple times to ensure accurate and consistent results. Step 5: Analyze the data and draw conclusions Compare the swing times of the pendulum for different string materials. Relate the results to your initial hypothesis and determine if the material has a significant impact on the time it takes for the pendulum to complete a full swing. This task tests physical reasoning by requiring the understanding of physical principles like energy conservation and forces, as well as the ability to apply this knowledge to design and conduct an experiment."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What government type is north korea? A:","response":"North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is a state with a government type that can be characterized as a combination of totalitarian, one-party rule, and dynastic dictatorship. The political system is centralized around the ruling party and the Kim family, which has been in power since the inception of the state in 1948. A: Totalitarianism Totalitarianism is a political system in which the state aims to control all aspects of society, including the economy, culture, media, and the thoughts and actions of its citizens. The government exercises strict and pervasive control over nearly every aspect of life, suppressing dissent and enforcing conformity. In North Korea, the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) implements totalitarian policies through a network of surveillance, propaganda, and repression. B: One-party rule North Korea is a one-party state, with the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) as the only legal political party. All other political parties and opposition movements are banned, and the country's decision-making processes are concentrated within the WPK. The WPK's grip extends to all branches of government, including the judiciary, executive, and legislature. The political system lacks separation of powers or any form of check and balance. Essentially, the WPK and the state are one and the same, ensuring that the party's interests and policies are enforced. C: Dynastic dictatorship North Korea's political system is also characterized by its dynastic elements. The Kim family has led the country since its foundation, with Kim Il-sung ruling as the first leader from 1948 until his death in 1994. His son, Kim Jong-il, succeeded him and ruled until his death in 2011. The current leader, Kim Jong-un, is Kim Jong-il's son and has held power since 2011. This hereditary succession demonstrates the dynastic nature of the political system, as leadership is passed down within the family. Aside from the ruling family, there is a concentration of power within a small group of elites, primarily from the military, government, and party officials. These loyalists are closely intertwined with the Kim family, reinforcing the dynastic control over the state. D: Juche ideology Underpinning the North Korean political system is the state ideology of Juche, which was developed by the country's founder, Kim Il-sung. Juche promotes self-reliance in political, economic, and military matters, stressing the importance of independence from external influence. It emphasizes the central role of the leader, cultivating a personality cult around the Kims. Juche has evolved over time, incorporating elements from Marxism, Leninism, and Korean nationalism. In conclusion, North Korea's government type is a complex mix of totalitarianism, one-party rule, and dynastic dictatorship, with Juche ideology as its foundation. The state is highly centralized and controlled, with absolute loyalty demanded from its citizens while strictly suppressing dissent and opposition."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

It is located in the ancient city of Varanasi, also known as Kashi, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The temple holds great spiritual and historical significance and has been mentioned in several ancient Hindu scriptures. There have been several structures and reconstructions of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple over the years, dating back to ancient times. The late 16th-century version we're discussing here was constructed by Raja Man Singh, a notable nobleman and a general in the court of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Raja Man Singh belonged to the Kacchwaha Rajput dynasty and was a powerful ruler who rose to prominence in the Mughal court. He held high positions and was given several important responsibilities in the Mughal administration, such as governing territories and leading military campaigns. Despite being a part of the Mughal administration, Raja Man Singh was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and placed great importance on preserving and promoting India's ancient religious and cultural heritage. Around the late 16th century, he built the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to provide a place of worship for devotees of Lord Shiva. The temple he constructed featured intricate architecture and detailed carvings of deities, showcasing the artistic and cultural prowess of the time. Unfortunately, Man Singh's version of Kashi Vishwanath Temple was later destroyed by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century, who subsequently built a mosque at the site, known as Gyanvapi Mosque. The current Kashi Vishwanath Temple, which stands adjacent to the Gyanvapi Mosque, was built in 1780 by Rani Ahilyabai Holkar, the queen of the Maratha-ruled Malwa kingdom. The distinct architectural elements and design of this temple are reminiscent of the Maratha and Nagara styles. In conclusion, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple constructed in the late 16th century was built by Raja Man Singh, an esteemed general in the Mughal Emperor Akbar's court, as a testament to his devotion to Lord Shiva. While this temple no longer stands, its legacy is preserved in the rich history and cultural significance that the Kashi Vishwanath Temple continues to carry today."},{"question":"Anna May Wong (January 3, 1905 - February 3, 1961) was an American actress. She is considered to be the first Chinese American movie star, as well as the first Chinese American actress to gain international recognition. Her long and varied career spanned silent film, sound film, television, stage, and radio. After the major disappointment of losing the role in The Good Earth, Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in Taishan. Wong's father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. Aside from Mei Lanfang's offer to teach her, she wanted to learn more about the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences. She told the San Francisco Chronicle on her departure, \\"... for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps upon my arrival, I shall feel like an outsider. Perhaps instead, I shall find my past life assuming a dreamlike quality of unreality.\\" Embarking in January 1936, she chronicled her experiences in a series of articles printed in U.S. newspapers such as the New York Herald Tribune, the Los Angeles Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, and Photoplay. In a stopover in Tokyo on the way to Shanghai, local reporters, ever curious about her romantic life, asked if she had marriage plans, to which Wong replied, \\"No, I am wedded to my art.\\" The following day, however, Japanese newspapers reported that Wong was married to a wealthy Cantonese man named Art. During her travels in China, Wong continued to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating in many areas of China because she was raised with the Taishan dialect rather than Mandarin. She later commented that some of the varieties of Chinese sounded \\"as strange to me as Gaelic. I thus had the strange experience of talking to my own people through an interpreter.\\" The toll of international celebrity on Wong's personal life manifested itself in bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking. Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted: \\"Down with Huang Liu Tsong - the stooge that disgraces China. Don't let her go ashore.\\" Wong began crying and a stampede ensued. After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited his family and his first wife at the family's ancestral home near Taishan. Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10 days in the family's village and some time in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China. After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: \\"I am convinced that I could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have no feeling for it. It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts.\\" Wong's father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.

Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"To determine if the statement \\"A man is about to do a drum solo\\" is true based on the sentence \\"A man in a black shirt prepares to play the drum,\\" we need to break down the information provided in both sentences and compare them. Here's how we can approach it: 1. Identify the subject: In both sentences, the subject is \\"a man.\\" This indicates that the two sentences are talking about the same individual. 2. Identify the action: In the first sentence, the man \\"prepares to play the drum.\\" In the second sentence, the man is \\"about to do a drum solo.\\" Both actions involve playing the drum, which indicates that there is some similarity between the activities. However, the difference between the two actions is the mention of a \\"drum solo\\" in the second sentence. A drum solo implies that the man will be playing the drum alone, likely in a performance context, and showcasing his drumming skills. The first sentence does not provide any context or information about performing a drum solo. 3. Identify additional context: In the first sentence, the additional context is that the man is wearing \\"a black shirt.\\" The second sentence does not mention any clothing details. Conclusion: Based on the given sentence, \\"A man in a black shirt prepares to play the drum,\\" we cannot confidently conclude that the statement \\"A man is about to do a drum solo\\" is entirely true. While both sentences involve a man playing the drum, there is not enough information in the first sentence to determine if he is actually about to perform a drum solo specifically."},{"question":"Caleb has 3 dozen jellybeans. Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb. How many jellybeans do they have in total? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Determine the number of jellybeans Caleb has. Caleb has 3 dozen jellybeans. There are 12 jellybeans in a dozen, so to find out how many jellybeans Caleb has, we multiply the number of dozens by 12. Calculation: 3 dozens * 12 jellybeans/dozen = 36 jellybeans Step 2: Determine the number of jellybeans Sophie has. Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb. Since Caleb has 36 jellybeans, we should take half of that amount to find out how many jellybeans Sophie has. Calculation: 36 jellybeans / 2 = 18 jellybeans Step 3: Calculate the total number of jellybeans. Now that we know how many jellybeans each person has, we can add these amounts together to find out the total number of jellybeans.

Sent 2: On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. Sent 3: It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. Sent 4: The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. Sent 5: The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. Sent 6: At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. Sent 7: The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. Sent 8: With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon.

On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Malawi (or ; or [maláwi]), officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast, and Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi. Malawi is over with an estimated population of 16,777,547 (July 2013 est.). Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is Blantyre, the third is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba. The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \\"The Warm Heart of Africa\\". - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - The Dwangwa River in Malawi is a tributary river for Lake Nyasa . It flows for approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) . The river 's source is in the Kasungu National Park , in Malawi 's central plateau . It flows north - easterly from this plateau through an ancient valley . The river 's mouth flows out of a more recently cut gorge , into the Lake . It also flows through the Bana Swamp The Dwangwa River is used both for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power . It is a fishing river , with prawns found in the river . - Mozambique (or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique (or \\"\\") is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (known as \\"Lourenço Marques\\" before independence). - Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. It is the ninth largest lake in the world and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa. It is home to more species of fish than any other lake, including about 1000 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011,while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park. Lake Malawi is a meromictic lake, meaning that its water layers do not mix. The permanent stratification of Lake Malawi's water and the oxic-anoxic boundary (relating to oxygen in the water) are maintained by moderately small chemical and thermal gradients. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra. Although recorded in 1942, the single would not be released until 1944 where it was Duke Ellington's last of four number one's on the Harlem Hit Parade. \\"Main Stem\\" also peaked at number twenty on the pop chart.

Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn? Hint: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Answer:","response":"The Orange farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn. This is because they did not grow cover crops, which could have helped in promoting the growth of the hyphal networks of the AM fungi.

These stories unfold over the course of nine months. Two couples live completely opposite lives of each other, yet share one commonality: an unexpected pregnancy. The main characters, Carmine and Sasha live in a carefree and comfortable world and the arrival of a child shakes up their conventional life: behind their illusion of a fancy condominium and their successful careers hides a couple that is living in pain, secrets and lies. Simultaneously, the other couple within the film, Justine and Seb are freedom seekers that live day by day on the streets of Montreal. These two young squeegee kids live in hopes of a better future, but in the meantime seem to be content with part-time jobs; such as washing windshields and doing small-time deals. Justine's pregnancy catches Seb off guard as he is not ready to be a father. The history of violence in their relationship makes getting an abortion the obvious choice, however things worsen and turn out differently. In the third story, Stephen Decker is a 50-something father who has lost everything, his wife, his only child, and his inner peace. Now he has found a new purpose for his life: revenge, which brings him from Calgary to Montreal as he attempts to hunt down his daughter's murderer.

Sentence A: \\"he worked out the problem and went to ask his classmates\\" - The subject \\"he\\" worked out the problem, meaning he solved it. - After solving the problem, he went to ask his classmates. - It is not completely against common sense, as he might want to compare his solution with others or help his classmates. However, it is less common for someone to consult classmates after already solving a problem. 2. Sentence B: \\"he couldn't do the problem and went to consult his classmates\\" - The subject \\"he\\" couldn't do the problem, meaning he couldn't solve it. - Then, he went to consult his classmates, probably to seek help, ask for different perspectives, or just to understand the problem better. - This sentence aligns with common sense, as it is reasonable for someone to consult others when they cannot solve a problem.

They decided to see every showing of Half Blood Prince that they could when it was released. Given the question \\"What will Jesse want to do next?\\", is \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" a valid answer? pick from the following. (a). Yes (b). No Answer:","response":"(b). No Based on the context given in the scenario, Jesse and Jordan share a love for Harry Potter, and thus they decided to watch every showing of the \\"Half Blood Prince\\" when it was released. Their interest seems to be centred around Harry Potter and the endeavors associated with it, some of which could include discussing theories about the story, reading Harry Potter books, purchasing Harry Potter merchandise, visiting Harry Potter themed parks or exhibits, or even watching other movies from the Harry Potter franchise. Given this, it would be reasonable to presume that Jesse and Jordan's next activity would, in some way, include their mutual passion for Harry Potter. The question \\"What will Jesse want to do next?\\" naturally brings to mind something related to this common interest. On the other hand, \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" doesn’t appear to be a valid response to the question since there is no context suggesting that Jesse or Jordan have an interest in the musical Hamilton or, more broadly, in musical theater. Hamilton is a famous Broadway musical based on the life of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, and while it is immensely popular, it has no direct tie-in with Harry Potter. In short, provided no additional context or information about Jesse's interest in musicals or Hamilton specifically, the response \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" is less plausible. Thus the most probable and valid assumption would be that Jesse and Jordan's next step will revolve around their shared interest in Harry Potter.

If you use a standard-size lace headband, you might need to take it in. You can use a white headband, but you can also try to find one in a color that matches your dress or your school colors. A petite lace headband is the sort of headband worn by babies and toddlers. To take the headband in, clip apart and remove the ribbon holding it together. Turn the headband inside-out and fold one end of the lace down until the entire length matches the length the garter needs to be. Line up the fold with the other end and stitch them together using a triple stitch or narrow zigzag stitch. Turn the garter right-side-out again. Cut 10 inches (25 cm) of narrow tulle. Fold it together and attach your embellishment with glue. You should have about eight layers of folded tulle. Even at this thickness, the tulle will be light enough to prevent it from being seen at a distance. Put a small amount of hot glue in the middle of the tulle before firmly fixing your embellishment on the dot. Let dry. You could use fake pearls or gems for an embellishment, but for something more themed to homecoming, use a charm of your school mascot or school emblem. You could also attach a football jewelry charm or a small bow made with ribbon in your school colors. Hand stitch the tulle onto the center seam of the lace headband to complete your garter. Trim your tulle down before attaching it.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: Who was the ruler of South African mandate when it took over the South West Africa German colony? Passage 1:German Namibians () are a community of people descended from ethnic German colonists who settled in present-day Namibia. In 1883, the German trader Adolf Lüderitz bought what would become the southern coast of Namibia from Josef Frederiks II, a chief of the local Oorlam people, and founded the city of Lüderitz. The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, proclaiming it German South West Africa (). Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials. In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost its colonial possessions, including South West Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former German colony was administered as a South African mandate. The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory alongside Afrikaans and English. Passage 2:Earle L. Reynolds (October 18, 1910 – January 11, 1998) was an anthropologist, educator, author, Quaker, and peace activist. He was sent to Hiroshima by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to study the effects of the first atomic bomb on the growth and development of exposed children. His professional discoveries concerning the dangers of radiation later moved Reynolds into a life of anti-nuclear activism. In 1958 he sailed with his wife Barbara, two of his three children and a Japanese yachtsman in the Phoenix of Hiroshima, a ketch he had designed himself, into the American nuclear testing zone in the Pacific. In 1961 the family sailed to the USSR to protest Soviet nuclear testing. During the Vietnam War Reynolds and his second wife Akie sailed the Phoenix to Haiphong to deliver humanitarian and medical aid to victims of American bombing. Passage 3:The Anita Kerr Singers or The Jordanaires sang background on just about every Nashville hit in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After she and Al Kerr divorced, she disbanded the Nashville version of her Anita Kerr Singers and relocated to Los Angeles in August 1965 with her second husband, Swiss businessman Alex Grob, and her daughters Suzie & Kelly. She no longer wanted to just be a background singer or arranger on country songs – she wanted to do pop music, jazz and \\"do more orchestral writing and music that was not just country.\\". She hired some lawyers to get her out of her contract with RCA’s Nashville division, got a contract with Warner Bros. Records, and formed a Los Angeles version of the Anita Kerr Singers. The new group, for the next five years, would include the following personnel: alto B.J. Baker or Jackie Ward, tenor Gene Merlino or Bill Cole, baritone Bill Lee, bass Bob Tebow, and Kerr herself as soprano and arranger. The half dozen albums recorded by the Singers for Warner included a cover version of the song \\"All You Need Is Love\\" by The Beatles, and one of the LPs was exclusively devoted to the songs of composer Bert Kaempfert. Disguising the group as the Mexicali Singers, Kerr also recorded a trio of mariachi-flavored albums with musical arrangements reminiscent of the Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass sound. The Anita Kerr Singers won another Grammy Award for their recording of A Man And A Woman, released as a single on Warner Bros. Records.","response":"To find the answer to the question \\"Who was the ruler of South African mandate when it took over the South West Africa German colony?\\", we can use information from Passage 1.

This desire stemmed from Neil's appreciation for one-of-a-kind creations and his genuine belief in the importance of originality and non-conformity in their work. By entrusting Justin with this task, he hoped to further strengthen their partnership and mutual respect, while simultaneously pushing them both to explore novel ideas and embrace the unpredictability of the creative process. Together, Neil and Justin embarked on the journey of brainstorming for their special project. They spent countless hours discussing different concepts, debating over their merits, and refining their respective visions. In their pursuit of uniqueness, they were careful not to stray too far into the realm of impracticality or obscure symbolism. It was important to them both that their creation not only represented their shared values and aspirations but also resonated with others and sparked meaningful conversations. During this collaborative process, both Neil and Justin discovered new facets of their creativity and artistic sensibilities. Having someone who shares the same goal of creating something distinct provided them with a rare opportunity to bounce ideas back and forth, enriching their own perspectives and expanding their horizons. As they delved deeper into the intricacies of their project, they began to recognize the powerful synergy that had emerged between them. It was as if each person's strengths were being amplified by the other's, with the resulting ideas far surpassing anything they could have achieved independently. As Justin worked on the technical and practical aspects of the project, Neil continued to provide invaluable input and guidance. He offered suggestions, critiqued progress, and encouraged Justin to push his own limits and take risks. Through this dynamic partnership, Justin grew both as an artist and an individual, learning to channel his creativity in new and unexpected ways. When the time came to unveil their special project, Neil and Justin were filled with both anticipation and trepidation. They had poured so much of themselves into this unique creation, and there was no denying that the outcome was as much a reflection of their partnership as it was of their individual talents. However, as their friends and colleagues gathered around to witness the fruits of their labor, it became abundantly clear that they had succeeded in their mission to create something truly unique. Their special project stood before them as a testament to what can be achieved through collaboration, passion, and a shared commitment to originality. It was a powerful reminder that when we dare to break free from the constraints of convention and pursue our dreams unapologetically, we can achieve greatness that extends far beyond our own, individual capabilities.

Verify the language: First, I will recognize that 'Kosher' is a term from the Hebrew language, which is commonly used in the context of Jewish culture and religion. 2. Research its origins: I will look into the origins of the term 'Kosher' within the Hebrew language to identify its literal translation. 3. Identify its religious significance: In addition to the language context, I will consider any religious associations or interpretations related to the term 'Kosher' within Jewish culture and tradition. After completing these steps, I found that the literal meaning of the word 'Kosher' in Hebrew is 'fit' or 'proper'. In the context of Jewish dietary laws, Kosher refers to food that is prepared and consumed according to the requirements of Jewish law, which are outlined in the Torah. These guidelines, known as Kashrut, dictate the types of foods that can be eaten, as well as how they should be prepared and served.

A:","response":"Gujarati"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

It is not hate that will cause our downfall as a nation but our indifferent attitude towards the main issues that our society is facing now. Stand Up For America Now has high hopes of changing that attitude. We want to be the voice of the American people. We want to live by the ideals and hopes of our country – the land of the free and the brave. Other nations look up to us for we used to embody justice, freedom, and peace. Yes, you read that correctly. We used to, past tense. In reality, we have become a divided nation that has led us to pursue personal interests over the common good. That is why there is a growing gap in our society just when we thought we should have surpassed issues regarding race, color, religion, and culture. It is as if we have taken big leaps forward in the past only to take even major steps backwards in the present so much so that our ideals of peace, justice, and freedom now look bleak in light of these current issues that we are facing. Stand Up For America Now enlightens the nation about pertinent social issues such as partial politics, home land security, affordable healthcare, climate change, gender equality, possession of guns, freedom of information, immigration, and other matters that should concern ordinary American citizens because they affect our daily lives. That is why we lay out the facts, uncover the truth, and give courageous commentaries regarding these issues to raise awareness among the people. We hope to awaken your sense of social responsibly so that you can join us in our fight for justice, peace, and freedom. It is our dream that one day, each one will be enlightened regarding the true state of our nation- that injustices, discrimination, and human rights violations continue to persist and we should put an end to them because they cause sufferings on our fellowmen. We hope to mobilize the American people to stand up for what is just and what is right regardless of our political affiliations. Yes, because it does not matter if we are Republicans or Democrats. What is right should always be right and what is just should always be just. There is no partiality to it. Stand Up For America Now is a loud voice in the society – be it in the virtual or real world. We will do everything we can to reach out to as many Americans as possible. We organize social campaigns to educate people about social issues. We encourage you to go out of your garage doors in Michigan or Arizona and join us. We hold rallies and demonstrations to let the government know that our vigilant eyes are always upon them, watching their every move, protecting the interests of the American people. We should stand up for justice. We should stand up for freedom. We should stand up for peace. We should Stand Up for America NOW. ||||| By Kevin Rincon Dr. Terry Jones, the preacher out of Gainesville who got national attention when he burned the Quran, he's announced he wants to run for president in 2012.

By doing this, Khomeini sought to impose Islamic mores and laws on the West. We don’t insult the prophet, he effectively said, and neither can you. That started a trend of condemning those in the West deemed anti-Islamic that persists to this day. Again and again, when Westerners are perceived as denigrating Muhammad, the Koran, or Islam, Islamists demonstrate, riot or kill. Khomeini’s edict also had the unexpected side effect of empowering individuals – Western and Islamist alike – to drive their countries’ policies. Fleming Rose, a newspaper editor, created the greatest crisis for Denmark since World War II by publishing 12 cartoons depicting Muhammad. Florida pastor Terry Jones sowed panic among American commanders in Afghanistan by threatening to burn a Koran. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula and friends prompted a crisis in U.S.-Egyptian relations with his amateurish \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" video. And the satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo caused the French government to temporarily shut down diplomatic missions in 20 countries. Plans by the German satirical magazine Titanic to publish attacks on Muhammad likewise led German missions to be closed. On the Islamist side, an individual or group took one of these perceived offenses and turned it into a reason to riot. Khomeini did this with “The Satanic Verses.” Ahmad Abu Laban did likewise with the Danish cartoons. Afghan President Hamid Karzai goaded his people to riot over burned Korans by American soldiers, and Egyptian preacher Khaled Abdullah turned “Innocence of Muslims” into an international event. Any Westerner can now buy a Koran for a dollar and burn it, while any Muslim with a platform can transform that act into a fighting offense. As passions rise on both sides of the divide, Western provocateurs and Islamist hotheads have found each other, as confrontations occur with increasing frequency. Which prompts this question: What would happen if publishers and managers of major media outlets reached a consensus -- “Enough of this intimidation, we will publish the most famous Danish Muhammad cartoon every day, until the Islamists tire out and no longer riot”? What would happen if Korans were recurrently burned? Would repetition inspire institutionalization, generate ever-more outraged responses, and offer a vehicle for Islamists to ride to greater power? Or would it lead to routinization, to a wearing out of Islamists, and a realization that violence is counter-productive to their cause? I predict the latter. A Muhammad cartoon published each day, or Koranic desecrations on a quasi-regular basis, would make it harder for Islamists to mobilize Muslim mobs. Westerners could then once again treat Islam as they do other religions – freely, to criticize without fear. That would demonstrate to Islamists that Westerners will not capitulate, that they reject Islamic law, that they are ready to stand up for their values. So, this is my plea to all Western editors and producers: Display the Muhammad cartoon daily, until the Islamists become accustomed to the fact that we turn sacred cows into hamburger. Daniel Pipes is president of the Middle East Forum. What was this article about?","response":"This article is about how publishing cartoons of Muhammad and other actions that might be considered offensive to Islam have caused tensions and protests in the past. The author, Daniel Pipes, suggests that if these types of actions were done more frequently, it might actually help to reduce the intensity of the reactions and make people realize that violence is not a solution. Pipes encourages Western editors and producers to publish cartoons of Muhammad daily so that people can become more accustomed to them and learn to accept them as a normal part of freedom of expression."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): Kate Kendall (born 27 July 1973) is an Australian actress best known for her role in the long-running Nine Network Australian drama \\"Stingers\\".

Stream of thoughts:","response":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In order to give a clearer understanding, let's break down the premise and hypothesis: Premise: \\"One white male is jumping over a line of white lawn chairs outside in a lawn.\\" The premise provides several key pieces of information: 1. There is one white male (the subject). 2. The male is performing an action: jumping. 3. He is jumping over something: a line of white lawn chairs. 4. The event is taking place outside in a lawn. Hypothesis: \\"A man jumps over some chairs.\\" The hypothesis is a simpler statement, but it contains essential elements connected to the premise: 1. It mentions a man (the subject), which corresponds to the white male in the premise. 2. The action is the same: jumping. 3. The man is jumping over something: some chairs. While the hypothesis doesn't specify the type of chairs (white lawn chairs), it still implies that chairs are being jumped over. 4. The location (outside in a lawn) is not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis, but since jumping over chairs is an action that usually happens outdoors, it can be reasonably inferred. In summary, the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise, as it captures the core elements of the scenario described in the premise: a man is jumping over chairs."},{"question":"Q:I read this background article the other day: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. I am facing a new situation today: David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which would partially ionize in water, sample A or sample B? A:","response":"Sample B would partially ionize in water, as it is a weak acid. Weak acids only partially dissociate in water, meaning that at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are present in solution. In contrast, strong acids like sample A completely dissociate in water, yielding one mole of H+ ions and one mole of the conjugate base, A−."},{"question":"Greg's grandma is a culinary expert. She is also very eager to teach others how to make great foods. One day she taught Greg how to make candied fruit. Greg was so excited about it that he bought two baskets of fruits, basket A and basket B, to make some candied fruits. He used the basket A fruits to make some candied fruits, but was too lazy to use the basket B fruits. He just kept the basket B fruits on his kitchen top. Which fruits' moisture would not be absorbed from within, basket A fruits or basket B fruits? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","response":"The moisture would not be absorbed from within the fruits in basket A, as these are the fruits that Greg used to make candied fruits. Candied fruits are made through a preservation process where whole fruits, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel are placed in heated sugar syrup. Over time, the syrup absorbs the moisture from within the fruit, effectively dehydrating and preserving it. This process, depending on the size and type of fruit, can take anywhere from several days to several months. Once the fruits become saturated with sugar, the osmotic pressure created by this high sugar concentration prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms, allowing the fruit to have an extended shelf life of up to a year. In Greg's case, he used the fruits from basket A to make candied fruits, so these fruits underwent the preservation process to have their moisture absorbed by the sugar syrup. Thus, the fruits in basket A would be the ones that did not have their moisture absorbed from within. On the other hand, the fruits in basket B were left untouched on the kitchen top. Since they did not go through the candying process, their moisture content remains intact, and they would be subject to normal spoilage over time."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: Diego Costa returns to Chelsea training after hamstring and groin injuries.

Title: Carnal Knowledge Movie plot: The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure as he sees it is to deny pleasure to men. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged. In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she meets Jonathan, feeling a physical attraction for him. They have sex. Jonathan convinces Susan not to have sex with Sandy.

Given the context: Why did Remy do this? Answer:","response":"Remy moved to the city after being tired of all the work on the farm due to various reasons, which can be broadly categorized into personal, social, and economic factors. These factors collectively played a significant role in shaping Remy's decision, making them leave their rural life behind to embrace the urban lifestyle. 1. Personal Factors: a. Exhaustion: One of the primary reasons Remy was tired of farm work could be the physical strain involved in it. The effort required to tend to crops, look after the livestock, and maintain the property can be taxing on an individual's physical and mental health. Bidding farewell to the farm life was an attempt by Remy to seek respite from the constant hard work and seek a more comfortable and relaxed lifestyle in the city. b. Adventure: Possibly, Remy wanted to experience more in life, explore new ventures, and step out of their comfort zone. Moving to the city might have been a way to venture into the unknown, meet new people, learn new skills, and enjoy new experiences that farm life couldn't offer. 2. Social Factors: a. Limited social circle: The rural lifestyle often comes with limited opportunities to meet and interact with new people. Remy might have desired to expand their social circle, network with diverse individuals, and create new relationships, both personal and professional. The city offers a more vibrant social scene, and its diverse population is appealing to those seeking a more dynamic network. b. Education and exposure: Remy might have been keen to gain more knowledge and exposure by pursuing higher education or attending workshops, seminars, and other events. The city often offers better opportunities for personal and professional development than a rural setting. The availability of resources such as experienced professionals, technological advancements, and varied cultural experiences could have been significant factors that attracted Remy to the city. 3. Economic Factors: a. Job opportunities: Farm work, while providing a livelihood, might not be financially rewarding or provide job security. Remy might have been motivated to move to the city in search of stable and well-paying employment with potential advancement opportunities. Urban settings typically offer a broader range of job prospects that cater to different skill sets and expertise. b. Infrastructure and facilities: The city provides better infrastructure and facilities such as healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. Remy might have decided to move to the city to benefit from a more organized and faster-paced life that provides easier access to necessary amenities. c. Diversified income sources: Relying solely on agriculture-related income can be a risky proposition, mainly due to unpredictability caused by weather conditions and market factors. Remy may have moved to the city to secure and diversify their income sources, ensuring a more stable financial future. In conclusion, Remy's decision to move to the city after being tired of farm work was shaped by personal factors such as exhaustion and the drive for adventure, social factors such as the need for an expanded social network and personal development, and economic factors like job opportunities, better infrastructure, and diversified income sources. The city promised an opportunity for Remy to enjoy new experiences, connect with a broader range of people, and secure a more stable financial future while benefiting from the resources and facilities that urban life offers."},{"question":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

The limestone labyrinth that is Slovenia's Postojna Cave is home to a most unusual animal. The olm (Proteus anguinus) is also known as the human fish, the baby dragon, and, in Slovenian, \\"močeril.\\" (Translation: \\"the one that burrows into wetness.\\") Olms are entirely aquatic and only found in the waters of caves in the Dinaric Alps—that is, parts of Slovenia, Italy, Croatia, and Herzegovina. They measure 8 to 12 inches long and have non-pigmented skin that is unnervingly reminiscent of white humans' flesh. The eyes of the olm are covered in a layer of skin, but that is no impediment—the species, having adapted to live in dark caves, is blind. Advertisement Your average olm lives for around 50 years. Not a bad run, considering axolotls get 15 years if they're lucky and stay out of trouble. If you'd like to see one of these marvelous baby dragons up close, take a Proteus-focused tour of Postojna Cave. You'll get to see the olm's natural habitat and the creatures themselves in the on-site aquarium.

The olm, a blind salamander found in cave rivers of the Balkans, is thought to live for more than 100 years but reproduces just once or twice a decade. A female in an aquarium at the Postojna Cave has laid 50-60 eggs - and three of them are now showing signs of growth. Nobody knows how many will hatch, or even precisely how long it will take. \\"Right now it looks like three are good candidates,\\" Saso Weldt, a biologist working at the cave, told the BBC. He and his colleagues have taken very long-exposure photographs in the darkened cave, in order to glimpse evidence of the tiny embryos developing. \\"She started laying eggs on 30 January. She is still laying one or two eggs per day, and they need something like 120 days till they hatch.\\" 'Quite extraordinary' That is an uncertain estimate, he explained, based on a colony of olms that was established in the 1950s in an underground lab in the French Pyrenees. There, they live in slightly warmer water, at 11C. \\"In our cave, it is slightly cooler, 9C, so everything will be prolonged.\\" It is a unique opportunity to observe the enigmatic olm - also known as the proteus - reproducing in the same caves where it has lived for millions of years. Image copyright Iztok Medja/Postojnska jama Image caption Nearly 60 eggs have been laid on the underside of a rock Image copyright Iztok Medja/Postojnska jama Image caption It will probably be at least four months before any eggs hatch \\"It is very significant because there is not a lot of data about anything, [relating to] the reproduction of this group of animals,\\" commented Dusan Jelic, a Zoological Society of London Edge Fellow who studies wild olms by diving underwater through cave systems in Croatia. If the baby olms hatch and develop healthily, Dr Jelic said, it would be \\"something amazing\\". \\"In the wild, we never find eggs or larvae. They are probably hidden within some very specific localities within the cave systems.\\" There is just such a labyrinthine cave system in Postojna, with its own population of wild olms - but remarkably, this particular clutch of eggs has been laid in an aquarium in the cave's heavily trafficked visitor area. \\"This is very cool - it is quite extraordinary,\\" said Primoz Gnezda, another biologist working at Postojna Cave. \\"But also, we are quite scared that something will go wrong, because the eggs are very sensitive.\\" Image copyright Iztok Medja/Postojnska jama Image caption Visitors can see the female olm via an infra-red camera As the only cave vertebrate in Europe, the olm is very well adapted to its sheltered, subterranean realm: karst caves, created as water eats its way through soluble rocks. \\"For 200 million years they were in an environment that didn't change,\\" said Dr Jelic. As a consequence, the animals - and especially their eggs - are very vulnerable to changes in water quality and temperature. Even the seasons barely reach underground. Baby dragons Back in 2013, another of Postojna's captive olms laid eggs - but none of them hatched and many were eaten by the other olms in the tank. This time, precautions have been taken. All except the mother olm have been removed and the aquarium is boarded up, to protect the eggs from light. Extra oxygen is being added. \\"Now it's up to them,\\" said Mr Weldt. An infrared camera feeds live video to a nearby screen so that the cave staff, as well as tourists, can see what happens. Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Olms have skin-covered, sightless eyes and protruding gills Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption They swim like eels and can go 10 years without food There is almost no movement, but occasionally the female olm stirs to check the eggs, to lay another, or to fend off amphipods - small, hungry crustaceans which she cannot see, but detects using electro-sensitive organs in her snout. The animal also has a powerful sense of smell, which helps monitor the eggs. \\"The eggs have a smell, so she can recognise which are alive and which are dead,\\" explained Mr Weldt. \\"And because food is so scarce in the cave system, she eats the ones that are not fertilised.\\" The proteus is something of an icon in Slovenia, even appearing on coins before the arrival of the euro. Hundreds of years ago, when floods occasionally washed the creatures from the region's caves, they were regarded suspiciously as baby dragons. Image copyright Iztok Medja/Postojnska jama Image caption The baby olms are the subject of newspaper cartoons and fridge magnets In the last few weeks, the Postojna \\"dragon mum\\" has become quite a celebrity and carries a weight of expectation on her slimy shoulders. The cave biologists feel it too. \\"It is a challenge and a responsibility,\\" said Mr Weldt. \\"I'm excited.\\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter ||||| Photo Creatures resembling dragons dwell deep within the caves of Slovenia. And now with the help of biologists, a new brood is set to hatch at an unusual aquarium, accessible by underground train. This crystal clear egg is one of three recently laid by an olm, a cave amphibian whose long sinuous body, stubby legs and frilly gills led people in the 15th century to believe it was the offspring of dragons. Though it does not breathe fire, the olm has several attributes fitting a creature of mythology. It can live as long as a hundred years and survive without food for 10. It is blind, but hunts using its incredible sense of hearing and smell, and it can detect electric and magnetic fields. Female olms only reproduce once every six years and it takes them until the age of 15 to become sexually mature. The aquarium, located at a tourist site known as Postojna Cave, last expected baby olms in 2013. But none of those eggs hatched and several were eaten by other olms in the tank, explained Sašo Weldt, a biologist who works there.

It’s something you don’t want to miss when working as a biologist in a cave.” Photo Mr. Weldt said that this time the cave staff has taken new measures to ensure that this batch of eggs has a better chance of developing. They have emptied the tank of all other creatures but the mother olm and her eggs. The mother is about a week into a 20-day period where she will lay as many as 30 to 60 eggs. Several weeks later, they are expected to hatch. “It’s the most iconic creature in the cave,” said Mr. Weldt. “We are hoping that in a couple of months we can state that we have baby dragons.” ||||| What is a summary?","response":"The Postojna Cave in Slovenia is home to a very interesting creature called the Olm, which is also known as the human fish or baby dragon.

Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats.

Charles Sale. Follow @@charliesale. The appointment of crisis management agency Milltown Partners to help keep Richard Scudamore in a job demonstrates how seriously the Premier League are taking the chief executive’s sexist emails scandal. Milltown Partners, who specialise in discreet reputational work for high-end clients, was founded by Paddy Harverson, former Royal spin doctor, and ex-Google executive DJ Collins. And BBC sports editor David Bond is set to join. The choice of Milltown also highlights the cosy governance set-up at the Premier League, which has to be reformed even if Scudamore stays in office. All-powerful Scudamore’s effective line managers are the PL’s audit and remuneration committee, who decide his bonus and salary. Serious: The Premier League have hired a crisis management agency to try and help Richard Scuadamore. Doubt: There are growing concerns whether Scuadamore's friend Bruce Buck should be A and R chairman. And that group is chaired by Scudamore’s close friend and shooting partner Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea. And Chelsea happen to be another client of Milltown. As a result, there are growing concerns as to whether Buck should remain chairman of the A and R group. The PL strongly defend their ridiculous two-strong board of Scudamore and interim chairman Peter McCormick, whose Harrogate firm receive a considerable proportion of their business from the PL. The PL claim the 20 clubs, who meet at least six times a year, are the directors of the company. But their one-eyed focus is purely on their own fortunes.

England captain Steven Gerrard will be a guest pundit with ITV for the Champions League final. Gerrard will now be spending a fortnight in Portugal. He is on holiday this week, followed by training with England at Vale do Lobo before the final in Lisbon. PREMIER LEAGUE sponsors Barclays, who have reportedly voiced upset over Scudamore’s sexist emails, are to change PR agencies. It is widely expected that Barclays will not renew their current three-year deal with the top flight, but they will hire Havas and instruct them to do a root-and-branch look into how much value the £40m-a-year PL backing brings to a bank involved in a major cost-cutting exercise.

And rather than Luis Suarez being honoured in the big room, it was a BBQ chicken and bacon slaw wrap and a prosciutto and asparagus melt. Ian’s priorities wrong. It will not please followers of rugby league giants Wigan Warriors that their chairman Ian Lenagan has chosen to go to the FA Cup final rather than his club’s Super League Magic Weekend clash with Leeds at the Etihad Stadium. Lenagan is also chairman of League Two football team Oxford United and an FA councillor. He was one of four councillors who spoke out in favour of Hull City owner Assem Allam being allowed to change the name of the club to Hull Tigers which the FA voted to reject. Meanwhile, it’s understood the astonishing decision for the Hull KR v Hull Super League fixture to be staged in Manchester at the same time as Hull City take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley wasn’t opposed by Hull rugby league club owner Adam Pearson. He used to be head of operations at the football club, but had an acrimonious exit following Allam’s takeover.

After Cole calls an ambulance, he receives a phone call from a friend who invites him out to drinks. Cole accepts on the condition that it is not a house party. Cole is frustrated to learn that it is a house party, and he goes downstairs to drink alone, where he meets Maya, the host. The two discuss an approaching asteroid.

The sentence could be about an electronic device or software having a feature named '32-scenario memory' that can be selected. The original given sentence: \\"32 scenario memory is selectable\\" was incorrect in terms of punctuation because it was missing a hyphen. In English, compound adjectives (two or more words that express a single concept and jointly modify the following noun) should always be hyphenated for clarity. In this sentence, \\"32\\" and \\"scenario\\" jointly modify the noun, \\"memory\\", so they should be connected by a hyphen \\"32-scenario\\". This make the sentence clear and easy to understand. The sentence also needs a period at the end to be grammatically correct. There is no need for commas or semi-colons in this sentence since it is succinct, and does not contain multiple clauses or lists of items that would require these punctuations. Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence is: \\"32-scenario memory is selectable.\\""},{"question":"asian stock markets were higher in early trading thursday in line with overnight gains on wall street .

Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), known as the Super Famicom in Japan and Super Nintendo in other regions, was released in 1990 and became a highly successful and innovative gaming console. There were several key technological advancements and popular games that contributed to the success of the SNES. 1. Advanced Graphics and Audio Hardware: One of the primary reasons for the success of the SNES was its advanced graphics and audio hardware. The console utilized a 16-bit processor that offered a higher color palette, larger sprites, and more detailed backgrounds compared to its predecessor, the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). In addition to improved graphics, the SNES also featured advanced audio capabilities, thanks to the custom-designed SPC700 sound processor developed by Sony. This allowed for higher quality music and sound effects, creating a more immersive gaming experience. 2. Mode 7 Scaling and Rotation: Mode 7 was a unique graphical feature of the SNES that allowed for background layer scaling and rotation. This technology gave developers the ability to create the illusion of 3D graphics, despite the SNES being a 2D system. Games like \\"F-Zero\\" and \\"Super Mario Kart\\" used Mode 7 to great effect, offering innovative gameplay experiences that had never been seen before on a home console. 3. Expansion Chips: The SNES had the ability to use expansion chips that could be integrated into game cartridges. These chips offered additional processing power and capabilities beyond the console's base hardware. One of the most famous expansion chips was the Super FX chip, used in games such as \\"Star Fox\\" and \\"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\\". The Super FX chip allowed for polygon-based 3D graphics, which was a significant leap in gaming technology at the time. 4. Memorable Games: The SNES is renowned for its extensive library of high-quality games, many of which are considered some of the greatest games of all time. Titles such as \\"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\\", \\"Super Metroid\\", \\"Chrono Trigger\\", \\"Final Fantasy VI\\", and \\"Super Mario World\\" showcased the capabilities of the console and created experiences that resonated with gamers around the world. 5. Backward Compatibility: Although not a direct feature of the SNES itself, the availability of the Super Game Boy accessory allowed players to enjoy their Game Boy games on the big screen using their SNES console. This added value for gamers who already owned Game Boy titles and increased the overall appeal of the system. 6. Multiplayer Experiences: The SNES came with two controller ports, making multiplayer games easily accessible. Popular multiplayer games such as \\"Street Fighter II\\", \\"Super Mario Kart\\", and \\"NBA Jam\\" allowed friends and family members to compete against one another, further enhancing the appeal of the console. In conclusion, the key technological advancements and popular games that contributed to the success of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System include its superior graphics and audio capabilities, innovative features like Mode 7 scaling and rotation, the use of expansion chips, an extensive library of memorable games, the added value of backward compatibility through the Super Game Boy, and the availability of multiplayer experiences. These factors combined to create a truly revolutionary gaming console that left a lasting impact on the gaming industry."},{"question":"Write a dialog about anything you want.","response":"Title: A Journey to the AI-Pioneered Future Characters: Dr. Lucy: A cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) scientist, researching and developing advanced AI technology.

The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads.

Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United... Answer:","response":"The last name of the person who kept private the nature of her illness until after her death is Ferrier.

H. L. Hunley takes his ship, the H.L. Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt.

In the first quarter, the Broncos trailed early, with a 34-yard field goal by 49ers' placekicker Joe Nedney. After a scoreless second quarter, the Broncos grabbed the lead in the third quarter, when quarterback Tim Tebow scrambled for a 1-yard touchdown run, followed in the fourth quarter by a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Broncos suddenly fell behind, with 49ers' quarterback Troy Smith scrambling for a 1-yard touchdown run, followed by his 28-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Michael Crabtree, and a 3-yard touchdown run by running back Frank Gore. The Broncos tried to rally when quarterback Kyle Orton threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Lloyd (with a blocked extra-point attempt), but San Francisco's defense stood their ground. Less than a month later, the Broncos were subjected to a videotaping scandal involving the team's director of video operations that occurred during a 49ers' walkthrough practice, one day before the game. Answer this question: How many yards longer was the second longest touchdown compared to the shortest?","response":"The shortest touchdown in the game was a 1-yard run, this was achieved twice, once by Tim Tebow of the Broncos and once by Troy Smith of the 49ers. The second longest touchdown recorded in the game was a 28-yard pass from Troy Smith to wide receiver Michael Crabtree. To determine how many yards longer this was than the shortest touchdown, we subtract the yardage of the shortest touchdown from that of the second longest. 28 yards (second longest touchdown) - 1 yard (shortest touchdown) = 27 yards.

See options at the end He was unable to reach the steering wheel in his car from the seat because the Possible answers: (I). steering wheel was too high.. (II). seat was too high..","response":"In the given sentence, the reason behind the individual's inability to reach the steering wheel in his car from the seat is attributed to the positioning of the steering wheel or seat itself. There are two possible endings for this sentence: (I). steering wheel was too high: In this case, the steering wheel's height and its relative position to the seat may have been the cause of the issue. This scenario can occur for various reasons, such as the design of the car, adjustments made by a previous driver, or if the vehicle has been modified for a specific purpose. As a result, the individual cannot reach the steering wheel comfortably while seated. When the steering wheel is too high, the driver might struggle to control the vehicle efficiently and safely. In extreme cases, this could lead to a hazardous situation on the road. To rectify this problem, the individual may need to adjust the steering wheel's height – if possible – or invest in a cushion for added support. In some cases, the solution may involve a professional customizing the vehicle to accommodate the driver's needs. (II). seat was too high: The second alternative points to the issue being related to the position of the seat. In this instance, the driver might find it difficult to reach the steering wheel due to the height of the seat, which could be causing a misalignment between the driver and the steering wheel. This could be the result of the seat being mechanically adjusted to an inappropriate height or the cushioning of the seat adding extra height. Additionally, certain car models may naturally have higher seats, leading to challenges when trying to reach the steering wheel. When the seat is too high, the driver's field of view could be obstructed, reducing visibility and increasing the risk of accidents. In this case, some possible solutions might involve adjusting the seat height if the car has that feature or seeking professional assistance to modify the vehicle configuration, allowing the driver to reach the steering wheel comfortably. In conclusion, both the steering wheel and the seat's height could potentially affect a driver's ability to reach the steering wheel. Depending on the specific car, these issues may be resolved through simple adjustments or might require more comprehensive measures to ensure a comfortable and safe driving experience."},{"question":"Translate to Russian: Under the proportional representation system, the size of the electorate may vary but the number of representatives for each district should be proportional to the size of the electorate.","response":"В системе пропорционального представительства размер избирательного корпуса может меняться, однако количество представителей от каждого избирательного округа должно быть пропорциональным размеру избирательного корпуса.

Question 2: Which is the most delicate algorithm to implement? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Question 1: What is the most beautiful implementation of Convex Hull you have ever seen? The most beautiful implementation of Convex Hull I have ever seen is the Graham's Scan. The elegance of the algorithm comes from its simplicity, efficiency, and the way it mimics the natural intuition one might use when considering how to form the convex hull. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is optimal for most Convex Hull algorithms. Graham's Scan works as follows: 1. Identify the point with the lowest y-coordinate, breaking ties by selecting the point with the lowest x-coordinate. This is known as the anchor point and is guaranteed to be on the convex hull. 2. Sort the remaining points based on their polar angles with the anchor point. In case of a tie between two points having the same polar angle, the point farther from the anchor point comes later in the sorted order. 3. Traverse the sorted list of points: a. If the current point makes a left turn with respect to the previously processed points, add the point to the convex hull. b. If the current point makes a right turn or a straight line concerning the previously processed points, remove the previous point from the convex hull until a left turn is achieved, then add the current point. Once all the points have been traversed, the resulting set of points form the Convex Hull. Graham's Scan maintains the elegance of capturing the essence of forming the convex hull through a simple sweep of the points, simulating the idea of wrapping the points with a rubber band or string. Question 2: Which is the most delicate algorithm to implement? The answer here depends on the context and your definition of \\"delicate.\\" However, one algorithm, which is both elegant and requires care in implementation, is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FFT algorithm is famous for its ability to transform a time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal with significantly fewer calculations than the naïve Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). This algorithm has a complexity of O(n log n) compared to the complexity of O(n^2) of the naive DFT. The FFT algorithm uses the divide-and-conquer approach, breaking the signal into smaller parts, repeatedly applying the transformation, and finally combining the results. The main complexity comes from the application of the recursive structure, careful bookkeeping of the indices, and handling the complex number arithmetic, which is necessary for calculating the transformation. Although FFT is not related to the Convex Hull problem, it serves as an example of an algorithm that is both elegant in its approach and delicate in its implementation. The complexity arises from the mathematical aspects (complex numbers, trigonometric functions) and the data manipulations (bit-reversal of indices, half-sized signal additions/subtractions). In conclusion, the answers to the two questions are not the same. Graham's Scan algorithm is a beautiful implementation for the Convex Hull problem, while the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) stands out as a delicate algorithm to implement, though not for Convex Hull but for converting time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Both algorithms are elegant and efficient in their respective domains and require attention to detail while implementing to ensure optimal performance and correctness."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Excellent Utilities\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

They stated a desire to go out to lunch, but didn't say that they actually did or that it was a large meal. III.

It checks kids' fitness levels. Students are tested at least twice a year. In 1956, US President Eisenhower created the test, and it has been a tradition in schools since 1966. There are five activities in the test: sit-ups , push-ups , sit and reach, endurance run or walk and shuttle run . Students who get scores at or above 85 percent on all the activities can get a Presidential Physical Fitness Award. The test encourages students to live a healthy and active life. Students taking the test are really testing their limits, according to the US National Association for Sport and Physical Education. China has a similar test: the physical education(PE) test. Beginning at the age of 7, students in China are tested twice a year to check if they are healthy and strong. They also finish activities like the endurance run, sit-ups and the shuttle run. However, unlike students in the US who get awards, Chinese students get points in PE tests. The highest score is 100. For junior school students, the PE test is more important because it is worth 30 to 40 points in the entrance exam for senior high school.

There are several sources of energy on Earth, such as geothermal, solar, and wind energy. Step 3: Determine the most relevant energy source for evaporation Out of the various energy sources, solar energy (radiation from the Sun) is the most relevant to the evaporation process.

Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","response":"Does the Garcinia Supplement for Men Work Effectively as in Women? Read This Article to Know the Answer and Get the Right Place to Buy. Garcinia supplements have gained quite a name in recent years for their potential weight loss benefits. Derived from the rind of the fruit Garcinia Cambogia, native to Southeast Asia, these supplements have been credited with assisting in weight loss efforts by curbing appetite and inhibiting fat production. A primary compound found in Garcinia Cambogia, Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA), has been the focal point of scientific studies to ascertain its effectiveness in contributing to weight loss. While the popularity of Garcinia supplements among women is well-known, a frequently asked question is whether it works equally effectively in men. Although studies and research on the effectiveness of Garcinia supplements are limited, it is valuable to understand that men and women fundamentally possess the same biological mechanisms that can benefit from Garcinia supplements. By analyzing existing research, it is evident that Garcinia supplements can be effective for both men and women in the following ways: 1. Appetite suppression: HCA present in Garcinia supplements has been found to increase serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that affects mood and appetite regulation. Increased serotonin levels lead to a feeling of satiety, helping individuals control hunger and food cravings, which in turn aids weight loss. 2. Fat production inhibition: Garcinia Cambogia is thought to prevent the conversion of excess carbohydrates into fat by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for this conversion, citrate lyase. This can be beneficial for both men and women in their weight loss journey. 3. Enhanced energy levels: Garcinia supplements are said to improve metabolism, leading to increased energy production by breaking down stored body fats. This helps both men and women engage in regular physical activity, further promoting weight loss. However, it is essential to bear in mind that these supplements are not a magic pill for weight loss. Garcinia supplements should be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise to facilitate weight loss goals. A vital aspect to keep in mind for men is that they might require a slightly higher dosage of the supplement compared to women, due to their higher muscle mass and basal metabolic rate. To find the right place to buy Garcinia supplements, it is highly recommended to consider the following factors: 1. Reputable brand: Opt for a well-established and reputable brand of Garcinia supplements to ensure product quality and safety. 2. Purity and potency: A potent Garcinia supplement should have at least 50% HCA. Look for a supplement that contains pure Garcinia Cambogia extract without any artificial fillers, binders, or additives. 3. Third-party testing: It is safer to buy supplements that have been independently tested by third-party labs to confirm their purity and potency. 4. Label directions: Always read and follow the label directions for usage, dosage, and potential side effects to enhance the supplement's safety and effectiveness. In conclusion, existing evidence suggests that Garcinia supplements can work effectively for both men and women, provided an appropriate dosage is used, and they are consumed alongside a healthy lifestyle. To purchase a quality Garcinia supplement, focus on reputable brands, third-party tested products, and pay close attention to labels for proper dosage and usage guidelines."},{"question":"A text is given in Hindi.

He never raced in track bandages, but typically wore a blinker hood, mostly to help him focus, but also because he had a tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. \\"He was a big fat sucker\\", Davis said. \\"I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to.\\" Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as \\"having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before ...\\" Groom Eddie Sweat was another important member of the Secretariat team, providing most of the daily hands-on care. Sweat once told a reporter, \\"I guess a groom gets closer to a horse than anyone. The owner, the trainer, they maybe see him once a day. But I lived with him, worked with him.\\" Laurin sent Chenery regular updates on Secretariat's progress, saying that the colt was still learning to run, or that he still needed to lose his baby fat. Chenery recalled that when Secretariat was in training, Lucien once said: \\"Your big Bold Ruler colt don't show me nothin'.

Article: How to deal successfully with a child showing outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift. Many parents may even fail to recognize and respond to their children's need until discouragement explodes into uncooperative behavior. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school. Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain aim to provide all environment where gifted children can develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians. Children here spend about half of a day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practicing in private rooms .The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths and basic sciences. What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is that the fees are high .However, each school will often scholarships and other forms of financial aid. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at an early age .Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a tense and disciplined environment. They stress,however, that their main aim is to turn out \\"well-rounded and well--balanced individual.\\" Question: According to school directors,what is a possible disadvantage for pupils?

Read industry publications or online articles for help, and write up a list of words. These words can help you come up with a brand name. For example, the following buzzwords might describe the tech industry: agile, explosive, change, connect. Come up with a list of adjectives you want consumers to associate with your brand name. These adjectives can be your company’s values or the emotions and experiences you want consumers to have. For example, an auto body shop might want consumers to feel relief, transparency, speed, and dependability. A new tech startup might want consumers to experience connection, curiosity, and excitement. Who are you trying to appeal to? Identify your ideal consumer’s style, income, interests, and level of sophistication. Young millennials and members of Generation Z will be drawn to different brands than their parents and grandparents. Furthermore, high-income people probably have different tastes than lower-income people. Avoid generalities. Not all millennials are hip and edgy. For example, you might be trying to appeal to young mothers. In that situation, your audience might be fresh, optimistic, stylish, and seeking stability. Look at your list of adjectives. Do they share something in common? Find a common thread and use that as your brand name. Your name can’t be a string of adjectives. For example, the adjectives for a children’s clothing shop might be “optimistic,” “growing,” and “new,” all of which suggest new beginnings and a bright future. “Sunrise” or “Sunshine” might capture this essence. Your name needs to stand out in the marketplace, particularly on the web. No one can find you if you name yourself “Hammer” or “Elastic.” True, Apple is the name of a famous company, but it would be hard for them to break out today without major money spent on marketing. Instead of “Hammer,” chose something slightly different: “Crushers.” You might combine words to create a name. For example, Groupon combined “group” and “coupon.” This is an easy way to pick a unique name that always conveys key information about your brand. Names must be easy to remember, so try to make them as short as possible! Ideally, your name should be one word, though that might not be possible. Instead of “We’re Open from Seven to Eleven,” one business named itself “7-11.” Which would you remember? 7-11 is a great name because it also communicates the company's defining characteristic: they are open from 7 in the morning until 11 at night. Your brand is much more than your business name. It also includes your logo and the color schemes you use on your products, website, and packaging. All of these elements must create a unified impression. For example, you might love the dark blue colors your web designer has used on your website. If so, then “Sunshine” probably isn’t a good brand name. Something will need to change—either the website or your brand name. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article provides guidance on creating a brand name that resonates with the target audience and stands out in the market. It advises considering the defining features of your industry, identifying desired adjectives to associate with your brand, understanding your target audience, finding a common thread among the adjectives, and creating a unique and memorable name that aligns with your brand's essence. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of a unified brand identity, including the logo and color schemes, to convey a consistent message."},{"question":"Q: How many cubes will have 4 coloured sides and two non-coloured sides ?

We can look at the problem step by step to understand how we arrived at answer (B): 1. To have 4 colored sides and 2 non-colored sides, the cube must be placed in one of the corners of the configuration. 2. For a corner, think of it as being part of a larger 3x3x3 cube. There are 8 corners in such a cube. 3. Since we need 2 non-colored sides, they will be the ones that are facing inside the cube (towards the center). 4. If you consider the corner cubes, two or more corner cubes share non-colored sides. So, we count each pair as a single cube as considering them as separate cubes would result in over-counting. 5. There are 4 pairs: (1: Top-left-front, 2: Top-right-front, 3: Bottom-left-front, and 4: Bottom-right-front) arranged diagonally. 6.

He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions. After reading the above, is \\"Can the government be overthrown?\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What questions have many Americans wondered?\\"? Select from the following. (1). no. (2). yes.","response":"(1). no."},{"question":"Background: Benjamin Lee Whorf (; April 24, 1897 - July 26, 1941) was an American linguist and fire prevention engineer. Whorf is widely known as an advocate for the idea that differences between the structures of different languages shape how their speakers perceive and conceptualize the world. This principle has frequently been called the \\"Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\\", after him and his mentor Edward Sapir, but Whorf called it the principle of linguistic relativity, because he saw the idea as having implications similar to Einstein's principle of physical relativity. Throughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young man he took up an interest in linguistics. Context: Until his return from Mexico in 1930 Whorf had been entirely an autodidact in linguistic theory and field methodology, yet he had already made a name for himself in Middle American linguistics. Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to Yale from the University of Chicago to take a position as Professor of Anthropology. Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on \\"Nahuatl tones and saltillo\\". Sapir replied stating that it \\"should by all means be published\\"; however, it was not until 1993 that it was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen. Whorf took Sapir's first course at Yale on \\"American Indian Linguistics\\". He enrolled in a program of graduate studies, nominally working towards a PhD in linguistics, but he never actually attempted to obtain a degree, satisfying himself with participating in the intellectual community around Sapir. At Yale, Whorf joined the circle of Sapir's students that included such luminary linguists as Morris Swadesh, Mary Haas, Harry Hoijer, G. L. Trager and Charles F. Voegelin. Whorf took on a central role among Sapir's students and was well respected. Sapir had a profound influence on Whorf's thinking. Sapir's earliest writings had espoused views of the relation between thought and language stemming from the Humboldtian tradition he acquired through Franz Boas, which regarded language as the historical embodiment of volksgeist, or ethnic world view. But Sapir had since become influenced by a current of logical positivism, such as that of Bertrand Russell and the early Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly through Ogden and Richards' The Meaning of Meaning, from which he adopted the view that natural language potentially obscures, rather than facilitates, the mind to perceive and describe the world as it really is. In this view, proper perception could only be accomplished through formal logics. During his stay at Yale, Whorf acquired this current of thought partly from Sapir and partly through his own readings of Russell and Ogden and Richards. As Whorf became more influenced by positivist science he also distanced himself from some approaches to language and meaning that he saw as lacking in rigor and insight. One of these was Polish philosopher Alfred Korzybski's General semantics, which was espoused in the US by Stuart Chase. Chase admired Whorf's work and frequently sought out a reluctant Whorf, who considered Chase to be \\"utterly incompetent by training and background to handle such a subject.\\" Ironically, Chase would later write the foreword for Carroll's collection of Whorf's writings. Question: What year did he attend Yale? Answer:","response":"Whorf attended Yale in 1931."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. I am facing a new situation today: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which reactants would have particle's with lower energy, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","response":"Reactant B would have particles with lower energy, as it consists of cooler reactants. According to the background article, particles of reactants at higher temperatures have more energy, while particles at lower temperatures have less energy.

Plot title: King Kong Movie plot: In the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, Fred Wilson, a spokesman and promotions specialist for a huge oil conglomerate, Petrox, is preparing a voyage aboard one of the corporation's exploration ships. As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jeff also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be \\"wed\\" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jeff is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials.

For example, it produces antidiuretic hormone. This hormone travels to the kidneys and stimulates them to conserve water by producing more concentrated urine. Q: What produces hormones that directly regulate body processes? Choices: - hippocampus - lymph glands - pancreas - hypothalamus A: The answer to this question is:","response":"hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a small region located at the base of the brain, and it plays a significant role in regulating various bodily functions, including the production of certain hormones. As mentioned in the paragraph, the hypothalamus produces hormones that directly regulate body processes. One of these hormones is the antidiuretic hormone, which has a specific function in conserving water in the body. The antidiuretic hormone is produced by the hypothalamus, and it travels to the kidneys where it stimulates them to conserve water. This process is carried out by generating more concentrated urine, resulting in less water being lost from our body. This regulation is vital for maintaining a healthy balance of water and electrolytes within the body, which ensures proper functioning of various organs and systems. The other choices listed, such as the hippocampus, lymph glands, and pancreas, also play essential roles within the body, but they are not responsible for producing hormones that directly regulate body processes as the hypothalamus does. The hippocampus is an integral part of the limbic system and plays a central role in the formation of new memories, as well as learning processes. Meanwhile, the lymph glands, or lymph nodes, are essential components of the immune system, responsible for filtering harmful substances and producing white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help defend the body against infections and diseases. Lastly, the pancreas is an organ that has dual functions; it releases digestive enzymes and produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon, which are critical in regulating blood sugar levels. However, none of these choices are specifically responsible for producing hormones that directly regulate body processes like the hypothalamus."},{"question":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who drives a Corolla?

Meanwhile, the pooch tries to convince himself that all that is going on is nothing but a bad dream (consulting Sigmund Fraud and using sleeping pills to laugh off each attempt). In the end, the Gophers get rid of their foe for good by tying a harness around the sleeping Barnyard Dawg's belly, then attaching it to a hot air balloon before launching it (getting a tear in at as it goes up), leaving them free to \\"raise their vegetables\\" into a long pipe leading from the barn to their burrow. Meanwhile, the balloon's hull leaks out completely, and the dog awakens atop a light pole. After he wakes up and realising his surroundings, Barnyard Dawg mentally snaps and begins to fly! The pig - confused about everything he has seen - goes to psychiatrist Dr. Cy Kosis for counseling. Kosis realizes he needs counseling (and joins his client on the couch) when he sees the Barnyard Dawg flying by the window. Answer:","response":"The client that Dr. Cy Kosis joins on the couch in the given article is the confused pig who has just witnessed a series of unusual and perplexing events involving the Gophers, Barnyard Dawg, and their antics. The pig seeks counseling from Dr. Cy Kosis to make sense of what he has seen, and right when Dr. Kosis joins the pig on the couch, they both witness the Barnyard Dawg flying by the window, which leads Dr. Kosis to realize that he too needs counseling."},{"question":"Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? The sheep got infected with scrapie. Select from: - unacceptable. - acceptable.","response":"To determine if the sentence is correct by the strictest standards, let's examine it step by step: 1. Check the sentence structure: The sentence has a subject (the sheep), a verb (got), and an object (infected with scrapie). This is a complete sentence with a clear meaning. 2. Check grammar: The grammar in the sentence is correct. \\"Got\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"get,\\" and \\"infected\\" is used as an adjective here, describing the state of the sheep. 3. Check word choice: \\"Scrapie\\" is an appropriate word to describe the disease that affects sheep. 4.

The song also spent two weeks at No. 8 in Canada, and is ranked as the 47th biggest Canadian hit of 1980. In Australia it reached No. 13. - Rockpalast (\\"Rock Palace\\") is a German music television show that broadcasts live on German television station Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR). \\"Rockpalast\\" started in 1974 and continues to this day. Hundreds of rock and jazz bands have performed on \\"Rockpalast\\". Some acts were recorded for broadcast and for retail sale. All-night marathon shows called Rock Night (\\"Rocknacht\\") were produced once or twice a year from 1977 through 1986 and simulcast throughout Europe via the Eurovision network of TV broadcasters. \\"Rockpalast\\" is involved in several German pop, rock and underground music festivals, once sponsoring Bizarre Festival. - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - Carol Patricia Mas (born October 20, 1955), professionally known as Carolyne Mas, is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and producer. She broke out of the Greenwich Village music scene boom of the late 1970s, along with other artists such as Steve Forbert, The Roches, and Willie Nile. Although she remains relatively unknown in the United States, except for a loyal cult of fans, she managed to gain popularity in Europe and Canada, mostly due to the use of television as a promotional tool in these markets. Her records did well in the charts in Canada, but her greatest success was in Germany, where a live album, \\"Mas Hysteria\\", was released by Phonogram. It was originally intended to promote her upcoming appearance on Rockpalast in January 1981, and included her most significant hit, \\"Sittin' in the Dark\\". - Willie Nile (born Robert Noonan on June 7, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter.

When we did find it and ask for my Sister-in Laws room the Nurses acted like we were bothering them which made us a bit uncomfortable. The second time was when my man extreme pain and was bleeding from the mouth.

The positive aspect is that the reviewer finds the hospital to be neat, clean, and well-maintained, as evidenced by the polished water fountains. This indicates that the reviewer appreciates the hospital's cleanliness and attention to detail in maintaining a hygienic environment. On the other hand, the negative aspects of the review are more prominent. The reviewer mentions their difficulty navigating the hospital, especially the maternity ward, which they found hard to locate due to insufficient signage. This frustrating experience may have made their visit more challenging and less enjoyable. Furthermore, the reviewer also mentions encountering unhelpful nursing staff who seemed bothered by their inquiries. This attention to a less-than-friendly atmosphere indicates that the reviewer values the quality of interpersonal interactions and patient care, and in this case, they found the hospital staff lacking. Lastly, the most significant negative experience mentioned in the review was the long wait time for the reviewer's partner, who was in extreme pain and bleeding from the mouth. Despite the seriousness of the situation, the hospital staff was unwilling to expedite their care, which led the reviewer to seek treatment at another hospital where the wait time was much shorter. This experience reflects poorly on the hospital's responsiveness and prioritization of patient needs, as well as their ability to adequately address emergencies. In conclusion, it seems that although the hospital is praised for its cleanliness, the negative experiences associated with poor wayfinding, unhelpful staff, and long wait times for urgent cases outweigh the positive aspects in this review. As a result, the review is primarily negative, indicating that the reviewer did not have an overall positive experience at Summerlin Hospital on both occasions."},{"question":"Instructions: Given a scientific question, generate an incorrect answer to the given question.

It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo. - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring . - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987. - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle. - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers. - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971. - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981. - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction.

The company said Thursday it will use technology and human reviewers to try to staunch what it called in a statement “misinformation in these new visual formats.” Previously, the company’s efforts had been focused on rooting out false articles and links. ... ||||| By Antonia Woodford, Product Manager We know that people want to see accurate information on Facebook, so for the last two years, we’ve made fighting misinformation a priority. One of the many steps we take to reduce the spread of false news is working with independent, third-party fact-checkers to review and rate the accuracy of content. To date, most of our fact-checking partners have focused on reviewing articles. However, we have also been actively working to build new technology and partnerships so that we can tackle other forms of misinformation. Today, we’re expanding fact-checking for photos and videos to all of our 27 partners in 17 countries around the world (and are regularly on-boarding new fact-checking partners). This will help us identify and take action against more types of misinformation, faster. How does this work? Similar to our work for articles, we have built a machine learning model that uses various engagement signals, including feedback from people on Facebook, to identify potentially false content. We then send those photos and videos to fact-checkers for their review, or fact-checkers can surface content on their own. Many of our third-party fact-checking partners have expertise evaluating photos and videos and are trained in visual verification techniques, such as reverse image searching and analyzing image metadata, like when and where the photo or video was taken. Fact-checkers are able to assess the truth or falsity of a photo or video by combining these skills with other journalistic practices, like using research from experts, academics or government agencies. As we get more ratings from fact-checkers on photos and videos, we will be able to improve the accuracy of our machine learning model. We are also leveraging other technologies to better recognize false or misleading content. For example, we use optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from photos and compare that text to headlines from fact-checkers’ articles. We are also working on new ways to detect if a photo or video has been manipulated. These technologies will help us identify more potentially deceptive photos and videos to send to fact-checkers for manual review. Learn more about how we approach this work in an interview with Tessa Lyons, Product Manager on News Feed. How do we categorize false photos and videos? Based on several months of research and testing with a handful of partners since March, we know that misinformation in photos and videos usually falls into three categories: (1) Manipulated or Fabricated, (2) Out of Context, and (3) Text or Audio Claim. These are the kinds of false photos and videos that we see on Facebook and hope to further reduce with the expansion of photo and video fact-checking. (See more details on these examples from the fact-checkers’ debunking articles: Animal Politico, AFP, France 24, and Boom Live). What’s different about photos and videos? People share millions of photos and videos on Facebook every day. We know that this kind of sharing is particularly compelling because it’s visual. That said, it also creates an easy opportunity for manipulation by bad actors. Based on research with people around the world, we know that false news spreads in many different forms, varying from country to country. For example, in the US, people say they see more misinformation in articles, whereas in Indonesia, people say they see more misleading photos. However, these categories are not distinct. The same hoax can travel across different content types, so it’s important to build defenses against misinformation across articles, as well as photos and videos. ||||| Today, Facebook announced that it’s expanding photo and video fact-checking capabilities to all of its third-party fact-checking partners. Product Manager Tessa Lyons sat down with us to explain how the company is using technology, along with human reviewers, to find and take action on misinformation in these new visual formats — and where the company needs to keep investing. Facebook has been tackling article-based misinformation for a while now, but photos and videos are a relatively new frontier. What’s the difference between those two types of misinformation? We started our work on misinformation with articles because that’s what people in the US were telling us was the most prevalent form of false news they were seeing, and also because that was the way that financially motivated bad actors were making money off of misinformation. What they’d do is they’d share articles that contain misinformation — and people would be surprised by the headlines because they were false. So they’d click on those articles and land on websites where those bad actors were monetizing their impressions with ads. So it was spammy, “gotcha” content. Right, they were financially motivated spammers. So we focused on articles to go after and disrupt those financial incentives and to respond to what we were hearing from people. But we know from our research in countries around the world — and in the US — that misinformation isn’t limited to articles. Misinformation can show up in articles, in photos, in videos. The same false claim can appear as an article headline, as text over a photo or as audio in the background of a video. In order to fight misinformation, we have to be able to fact-check it across all of these different content types. You mentioned people in the US said they saw more misinformation in articles, rather than in other formats. Is that true around the world? The degree to which there’s misinformation in articles, photos or videos varies country to country — in part because the amount of photos or videos versus articles in people’s News Feed varies country by country. In some countries, articles make up a greater proportion of people’s News Feed than in others. Visual content might also lean more toward photos than videos in some countries, or vice versa. Why is that? Well first and foremost, News Feed is personalized. So what you see in your News Feed is personal to you and you might see more articles, photos or videos based on the people you’re friends with, the Pages you follow, and the way you interact with the stories in your News Feed. But we know there are some things that make the News Feed experience more similar for people in some countries. So for example, in countries where many people are worried about their bandwidth, people might be less inclined to click on videos. So people in those countries might see fewer videos in their News Feed overall — which means less video-based misinformation. There are other differences in the media landscape and literacy rates that impact how photo and video misinformation is interpreted too. In countries where the media ecosystem is less developed or literacy rates are lower, people might be more likely to see a false headline on a photo, or see a manipulated photo, and interpret it as news, whereas in countries with robust news ecosystems, the concept of “news” is more tied to articles. Can you use the same technology to catch all those different types of misinformation? Yes and no. When we fight misinformation, we use a combination of technology and human review by third-party fact-checkers. When it comes to articles, we use technology to, first, predict articles that are likely to contain misinformation and prioritize those for fact-checkers to review. Second, once we have a rating from a fact-checker, we use technology to find duplicates of that content. We’ve been doing this with links for a while; for example, a fact-checker in France debunked the claim that you can save a person having a stroke by using a needle to prick their finger and draw blood. This allowed us to identify over 20 domains and over 1,400 links spreading that same claim. Now, we’ll apply a similar technology to identify duplicates of photos and videos that have been debunked by fact-checkers so that we can make the most of each rating from fact-checking partners. While there are similarities in the technology, there are also important differences in how we identify articles versus photos and videos. Okay — let’s talk about that first stage: using technology to predict what’s likely to be false. When we’re predicting articles that are likely to contain misinformation, we use signals like feedback from our community, telling us that a link they’re seeing is false news. We look at whether the comments on the post include phrases that indicate readers don’t believe the content is true. We also look at things like whether the Pages that shared the content have a history of sharing things that have been rated false by fact-checkers. Signals like these apply to articles, photos and videos. So a lot of the work we’ve done to predict potentially false links also helps us with photos and videos. However, there are also some differences. When we talk about misinformation in photos and videos, we break it into three categories: manipulated, taken out of context, or includes a false text or audio claim. So let’s take each of those. Manipulated: You can have a photo that’s been manipulated to suggest that a person was in the picture when they weren’t. Or if someone is taking an action in a photo — like holding something — you could manipulate it to make it look like they’re holding something else. So like, when you see a photo of a shark swimming on the highway. Right, that’s a great example of a manipulated photo. For manipulated videos, the term “deepfakes” is something a lot of people in the misinformation space have been talking about — where, for example, you can make it look like a public figure was saying things that they never actually said, but in the video their mouth would actually be moving, and it would sound like their voice. So the shark example would be what we classify as a manipulated piece of media. The second category is things taken out of context. So, a photo of a conflict zone that’s being shared in a way that suggests it’s happening in a different time or place. Same with video. The third category is false audio or text claims. Just as you can have false headlines or text in an article, that claim could be overlaid on a photo or spoken by someone in a video. The same way that someone could make a false claim in an article, they could also make a false claim in the caption on a photo or while speaking in a video. So those are the three categories that we think about. And there are different ways we can use technology to predict each of them, and our ability to do so is at different levels of development. So how far along is the technology to predict misinformation in each of those three categories? We’ve started making progress in identifying things that have been manipulated. But figuring out whether a manipulated photo or video is actually a piece of misinformation is more complicated; just because something is manipulated doesn’t mean it’s bad. After all, we offer filters on Facebook Stories and in some ways that’s a manipulation, but that’s obviously not the kind of stuff we’re going after with our fact-checking work. But we are now able to identify different types of manipulations in photos, which can be a helpful signal that maybe something is worth having fact-checkers take a look at. Understanding if something has been taken out of context is an area we’re investing in but have a lot of work left to do, because you need to understand the original context of the media, the context in which it’s being presented, and whether there’s a discrepancy between the two. To examine a photo of a war zone, figure out its origin, and then assess whether that context is accurately represented by the caption now circulating with that photo, we still need a degree of human review. And that’s why we rely on fact-checkers to leverage their journalistic expertise and situational understanding. For photos or videos that make false text or audio claims, we can extract the text using optical character recognition (OCR) or audio transcription, and see if that text includes a claim made that matches something fact-checkers have debunked. If it does, we’ll surface it to fact-checkers so they can verify the claim is a match. At the moment, we’re more advanced with using OCR on photos than we are with using audio transcription on videos. So what about the other side, finding duplicates of false claims? Well, the way you find duplicates of articles is through natural language processing, which is a machine learning technique that can be used to find duplicates of text with slight variations. For photos, we’re pretty good at finding exact duplicates, but often times we’ll see that someone will add small changes to the photo which adds a layer of complexity; the more a photo shifts from its original form, the harder it is for us to detect and enforce against. So we need to continue to invest in technology that will help us identify very near duplicates that have been changed in small ways. ||||| Getty Images In the quest to weed out fake news on social media, Facebook is expanding its fact-checking efforts in 17 countries to include photos and videos as well as articles, the company said in a blog post Thursday. In the post, product manager Antonia Woodford said Facebook has built a machine-learning model that flags possibly false content for fact-checkers to look at. And she said all the company's 27 fact-checking partners in the countries will now be increasing the scope of what they look at. \\"Many of our third-party fact-checking partners have expertise evaluating photos and videos and are trained in visual verification techniques, such as reverse image searching and analyzing image metadata, like when and where the photo or video was taken,\\" Woodford said. This comes as social media giants like Facebook and Twitter have had to grapple with how their networks can be used to spread fake news and misinformation and even influence elections. Last week, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg went to Capitol Hill along with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to answer questions from lawmakers during a Senate intelligence committee hearing. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company has learned a lot since Russian meddling in the 2016 election and that it's \\"developed sophisticated systems that combine technology and people to prevent election interference on our services.\\" Zuckerberg kicked off 2018 with an open letter pledging to fix the social network's many problems. In addition to fake news and election interference, reports surfaced in April that digital consultancy Cambridge Analytica had misused the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users. The scandal touched off a series of apologies, an overhaul of Facebook privacy settings and an expensive investigation into its relationships with app developers.

Before bringing your new pet home you need to decide if you intend the bunny to be a house rabbit or live outdoors in a run in the yard. House rabbits are popular pets but there are a few factors to consider. While you will have to do more cleaning and training for a rabbit that lives indoors with you, you will not have as much social contact with a rabbit that lives outside. If you decide to keep your rabbit inside, you will need to rabbit-proof your house. Rabbits chew anything and everything, including electrical cables and the legs of your antique furniture. Make sure you are able to 'rabbit proof' your home so that cables are all tidied away out of reach of the rabbit, and there is no item that you would be upset if it got damaged by gnawing. If you decide to keep your rabbit inside you will also need to litter box train it. It is not hygienic to have the rabbit ranging around the house, pooping and peeing wherever they please. The solution is to litter train the rabbit to use a litter box. However, most rabbits poop mostly in one particular spot, so you can use this to your advantage by placing a litter tray in whichever spot they usually poop. If you have a male rabbit who is spraying urine everywhere, you may need to get him desexed. If you decide to keep your rabbit outside you will need to commit to spending time socializing it every day. Make it a part of your schedule, otherwise the rabbit may become anxious and fearful in your company. The hutch (or rabbit house) should be at least 2 feet (0.61 m) wide and 4 feet long, and tall enough to let the rabbit stand up to its full height. The bottom of the cage should not be made of wire, but the sides can be. Outdoor hutches are most commonly made of wood with a door fitted at the front made of chicken wire. This allows for good ventilation and for the rabbit to see out. The wood offers a degree of thermal protection to insulate the rabbit from the elements, and is sturdy, protecting the rabbit from predators. An outdoor hutch will need to have a run attached to it, so that your rabbit can exercise. The run should be a minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 8 ft by 2ft tall, for a rabbit under 2kg. Many indoor hutches are made of plastic with a wire roof. This has the advantage of being lightweight, so you can move it around the house easily. If you can't find a hutch you like, make your own! It isn't as simple as buying one, but it can be much better for your rabbit. You must provide bedding that is soft, warm and absorbent. Cover the entire base to a minimum depth of 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm). This cushions the backs of the rabbit's hind legs, which are prone to pressure sores if not enough padding is provided. Commonly used substrates for bedding include wood chips, hay, or straw. Of these, straw is the warmest and softest and makes the best bedding material, hay is second best (and is more expensive than straw), and sawdust it third best. You will need to litter train your rabbit if you are keeping it inside. The litter tray will need to fit inside the hutch and not take up more than a third of the floor space. Summary:","response":"Consider factors like cleaning, rabbit-proofing, and socialization when deciding whether to keep your pet rabbit indoors or outdoors, and ensure a suitable hutch, bedding, and litter training for their well-being and comfort."},{"question":"Q:Facts: - successor: party abolished - party: the heritage party - death date: 17 april 2010 - predecessor: new position - office: leader of the heritage party of alberta - term end: 1987 - term start: 1984 - birth date: october 27 , 1923 - death place: edmonton , alberta Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of mike pawlus .

But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Wave energy comes from the water.\\"? Answer:","response":"No, the answer \\"Wave energy comes from the water\\" is not true according to the passage. As mentioned in the article, wave energy actually comes from the wind.

Did Bill Clinton do more for black people than Barack Obama? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"These two questions are not the same, but they examine the actions and impacts of two different U.S. Presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, with a focus on the African American community. I will address each question separately for a comprehensive understanding. 1. What has Barack Obama done that gets so many people angry? It is important to bear in mind that Presidents often draw both admiration and criticism for their policies and actions. While Barack Obama achieved numerous accomplishments while in office, there were several areas where people have expressed discontent or anger: a) Healthcare - The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \\"Obamacare,\\" was one of Obama's most significant and controversial legislative achievements. While it aimed to expand health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, critics argue that it led to increased premiums, limited choices, and infringed on individual liberties due to the individual mandate. b) Economic Policies - The Obama administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis included a 787 billion stimulus package that sparked criticism from those who believed it was wasteful, ineffective, or excessive government intervention. Additionally, some people argue that his administration’s regulation-heavy approach stifled economic growth and job creation. c) Immigration - Some critics took issue with Obama's executive orders on immigration, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA). These policies were seen by some as either too lenient or an overreach of executive authority. d) Foreign Policy - Critics of Obama’s foreign policy argue that his approach to global issues, including the Iran Nuclear Deal, the handling of the Syrian Civil War, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, left the United States and its allies more vulnerable. The administration's use of drone strikes in the Middle East, which caused civilian casualties, also generated anger. e) Partisanship - Obama's presidency exacerbated political polarization in the country, exacerbated by factors such as increasing racial tensions and the rise of the Tea Party movement. This polarization contributed to an atmosphere of anger and frustration for many Americans during his tenure. 2. Did Bill Clinton do more for black people than Barack Obama? This question is subjective and depends on the specific policies and actions one chooses to examine when comparing the two presidents. Here are some key points for consideration: a) Bill Clinton: - Introduced empowerment zones and enterprise communities, which aimed to improve economic opportunities in distressed urban and rural areas, including many African-American communities. - Increased funding for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) during his tenure. - Welfare reform, which some argue reduced the dependency on government assistance, but has also faced criticism for disproportionately impacting disadvantaged black Americans by tightening eligibility rules and reducing benefits. - Enacted the 1994 Crime Bill, which has been criticized for contributing to mass incarceration and disproportionately affecting African Americans. Later in his life, Clinton acknowledged some of the negative consequences of the bill. b) Barack Obama: - Implemented the Affordable Care Act, which increased healthcare coverage for many African Americans. - Launched My Brother's Keeper, an initiative dedicated to addressing the opportunity gaps faced by young men of color, including African Americans. - Supported criminal justice reforms, including reducing sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses, a policy that had disproportionate consequences for the black community. - Strengthened anti-discrimination laws in areas such as housing, employment, and voting rights, which often disproportionately affected African Americans. Ultimately, the assessment of who did more for the African American community depends on one's perspective on these policy actions and their impact. However, both Clinton and Obama spearheaded numerous initiatives that attempted to improve opportunities for black Americans in different ways."},{"question":"Is Swathi's murder taking a casteist turn? Why would jk Rowling allow fanfiction (Cursed child) as canon? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? I. no; II. yes;","response":"I. no First, let's discuss each question and topic separately. 1. Is Swathi's murder taking a casteist turn? Swathi's murder is a tragic and unfortunate event that gained significant attention in the media and among the public. Speculation over whether or not the motives behind her murder were casteist, mainly fueled by the aggressive nature of the crime, the suspects involved, and the subsequent investigations. However, it would be important to base any conclusion regarding caste-based involvement on credible evidence and not hearsay or unverified claims. Discussing a sensitive issue like caste requires objectivity and an understanding of the socio-cultural factors influencing discrimination in society. Taking any stand without substantial evidence may not only create a bias but may also trivialize the victim's plight. 2. Why would J.K. Rowling allow fanfiction (Cursed Child) as canon? J.K. Rowling's decision to consider the Cursed Child as canon can be attributed to multiple reasons. Firstly, the Cursed Child was written in collaboration with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, both well-respected playwrights and writers. Rowling's endorsement and involvement in the project lend credibility and, to a certain extent, the acceptance of the story as part of the Harry Potter series. Secondly, accepting fanfiction as canon helps keep the story universe alive and growing. A dystopian tale like Harry Potter has generated a massive following, with numerous fans wanting to explore new storylines, characters, and situations, which amplifies their interest in the series. By allowing fanfiction as canon, Rowling embraces the creativity and engagement of the fan community. Lastly, the Cursed Child provides a sense of closure to many fans eager to know what happens in the life of the beloved characters after the conclusion of the original book series. It allows fans to continue their journey in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Now to address the multi-choice problem: These two questions are distinctly different in subject matter and context. Swathi's murder and the investigation into its possible casteist aspects is a real-life crime issue that raises concerns about social and cultural prejudices that persist within society. On the other hand, the discussion about J.K. Rowling allowing fanfiction to be considered canon pertains to literary works and the Harry Potter series, delving into the author's rationale and the impact on the fan base. Therefore, I would choose option I. (No) as these two questions tackle separate issues and concepts."},{"question":"Lizzy: Bob is building a garden on his land, and he wants it to be fenced in to keep out varmints.

Step 3: Formulate the negative review in a clear and convincing manner Title: \\"Disappointing Experience at The Fancy Fork\\" I visited The Fancy Fork for the first time last night, and unfortunately, my experience was far from positive.

The salmon was overcooked and dry, while the lobster ravioli had a strange aftertaste that I just couldn't get past. To make matters worse, the side dishes were equally unappealing. The mashed potatoes were bland and the grilled vegetables were undercooked. 2. Service: It took nearly 30 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering, despite the restaurant not being particularly busy. Our server rarely checked in on us, and it took multiple attempts to flag someone down when we needed assistance. It was frustrating trying to enjoy a night out when the service was so inattentive. 3. Ambiance: One of the reasons we chose The Fancy Fork was for its upscale atmosphere, but we were disappointed in this area as well. The lighting was too dim to properly see our food, and the tables were cramped together, leaving us little room for privacy. This made for a less-than-ideal dining experience overall. In conclusion, I cannot recommend The Fancy Fork based on my experience last night. The combination of subpar food, slow and inattentive service, and a disappointing ambiance has led me to give this restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars."},{"question":"A record low attendance at the new Wembley could greet England against Norway on Wednesday night, but the game has plenty to offer.

Driven by greed, this conglomerate has polluted the environment through relentless industrialization, turning rivers and lakes into highly acidic pools. The citizens of New Haven, oppressed and desperate for change, are on the brink of rebellion. Reiss, a skilled mechanic and scientist in his late 20s, understands all too well the ever-present danger of life in New Haven. Orphaned at young age due to an \\"industrial accident\\" that claimed his parents, he vows to expose the truth behind Genesis Corp's atrocities and bring them down. With the help of a small group of rebels known as 'The Resistance,' Reiss uncovers a clandestine experiment being carried out by Genesis Corp: a dangerous new technology capable of transforming ordinary citizens into genetically enhanced, superhuman warriors called 'Super Soldiers.' Determined to stop Genesis Corp's sinister plan, Reiss infiltrates one of their research facilities to gather evidence. However, he is discovered and apprehended by Dr. Mirenzia, the mastermind behind the Super Soldier project. Intent on using Reiss as her next test subject, she subjects him to her latest experimental serum, hoping to create an even more powerful Super Soldier under her control. But something goes wrong during the procedure. Reiss' body rejects the serum, causing him to convulse and momentarily break free from his restraints. Amidst the chaos and confusion, Reiss lunges at Dr. Mirenzia, but she knocks him back into a large vat of the same acid responsible for his parents' demise.

He becomes an indestructible being, unaffected by the acid's harm and endowed with superhuman strength, agility, and a healing factor that resembles immortality. Emboldened by his newfound abilities and driven by rage, Reiss escapes the facility and joins the Resistance once again.

The coffee chain already offers its baristas two years of undergraduate tuition at ASU under its existing college achievement program. Now the company is extending that to four years for most of its workers. Here are more details: Who can apply: All full and part-time U.S. employees who do not already have a four-year degree. Starbucks says 70% of its workers do not have a bachelor's degree. Who's not eligible: Workers at Starbucks' \\"licensed stores,\\" such as those located inside grocery stores. Can you leave Starbucks after graduating: Yes. Employees will have no obligation to remain at Starbucks after they graduate. How does it work: Starbucks employees who qualify will receive a scholarship from ASU that covers 42% of the cost for each credit of course work. Starbucks will pay the remaining 58%, minus any other scholarships the employee receives. How often will Starbucks reimburse you: Starbucks will reimburse tuition costs at the end of each semester, as opposed to the end of each year as it currently does. So, employees who drop out or leave the company will be responsible for paying tuition for that semester. Related: This kid got into every single Ivy League college More than 140,000 out of a total of 191,000 employees are eligible for the program. Starbucks says the tuition reimbursement program is aimed at helping its staff, particularly underprivileged young workers, afford the education they need to succeed. Currently, there are about 2,000 Starbucks workers enrolled in ASU online courses. \\"For me, working at Starbucks is the opportunity for a better future,\\" said Markelle Cullom, a three-year Starbucks employee enrolled in the program, according to the company's news release. Tuition for ASU's online program is about 15,000 per year. The university offers 49 online bachelor's degree programs, in subjects ranging from business administration to art history. Over the next 10 years, Starbucks plans to spend at least 250 million to help 25,000 employees graduate. In addition to helping employees get ahead, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said the economy will benefit from having more educated workers in the labor force. \\"By giving our partners access to four years of full tuition reimbursement, we will provide them a critical tool for lifelong opportunity,\\" said Schultz.

With the proper education, Starbucks says these so-called \\"opportunity youth\\" represent a \\"huge, untapped talent pool for American businesses.\\" Schultz has been outspoken on a number of controversial social issues, including same-sex marriage and race relations. The CEO has also cultivated a reputation for being supportive of workers' rights at a time when low-wage workers have been agitating for higher pay and better benefits. In addition to tuition reimbursement, Starbucks offers benefits including healthcare and 401(k) matching for both full and part-time workers. ||||| April 6 Starbucks Corp is expanding its employee college tuition assistance program to cover the entire cost of getting an online bachelor's degree, the chief executive of the coffee chain said on Monday. The Seattle-based company, known for offering benefits such as healthcare and stock options, launched the \\"Starbucks College Achievement Plan\\" with Arizona State University in June 2014. It previously limited the program to juniors and seniors seeking to complete their degrees. The enhanced tuition reimbursement program from Starbucks comes at a time when an improving U.S. labor market is forcing major restaurant chains and retailers, including McDonald's Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, to raise hourly wages and improve benefits to compete for the best workers. Chief Executive Howard Schultz said Starbucks expects to spend 250 million or more over a decade on tuition reimbursement, a perk he said Starbucks employees had requested. \\"The unfortunate reality is that too many Americans can no longer afford a college degree, particularly disadvantaged young people, and others are saddled with burdensome education debt,\\" said Schultz, who added that Starbucks hopes to help 25,000 employees earn their degrees by 2025. Starbucks employees working 20 hours per week or more, which account for roughly 80 percent of the company's U.S. workforce of more than 140,000, are eligible. Nearly 2,000 Starbucks employees, known as partners, already have enrolled in the program. The students, who need not complete a degree or stay with the company after earning a diploma, will be reimbursed for the cost of their classes at the end of every semester, Starbucks said. Starbucks, which recently raised worker pay but did not disclose the size of the increases, said it expects to have \\"several hundred\\" graduates by the end of 2016. Schultz told Reuters that he would be open to expanding the program to include master's degrees in the future.

Hong Kong Phooey is the secret alter ego of mild-mannered police station janitor Penrod Pooch and fights crime using his martial arts skills. The series does feature a cat character named Spot, but he is not the main character's sidekick or pet. Instead, Spot is a sarcastic and cunning cat that resides at the police station with Penrod. Spot often assists Hong Kong Phooey in solving cases and fighting criminals but prefers to let Hong Kong Phooey take all the credit.

Which country didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","response":"The country between Spain and Italy that didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats due to global warming is Italy. According to the provided context, Italy relies on ecological alternatives for energy production, as opposed to Spain, which relies heavily on the use of fossil fuels and natural gas. Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are currently the world's primary energy source. They are formed from the remains of ancient marine plants and animals, like dinosaurs, over the course of millions of years. When burned, fossil fuels release a high amount of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, which substantially contributes to global warming. Natural gas, while cleaner than oil and coal, is still associated with the production of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, all of which contribute to global warming and climate change when released into the atmosphere. On the other hand, ecological alternatives employed by Italy constitute renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. These sources produce electricity without directly emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Thus, their usage decreases the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mitigating global warming's impact and preserving natural habitats. It's worth noting that no country is entirely guilt-free when it comes to contributing to climate change, as various aspects of human activities release carbon and other greenhouse gases. In this particular comparison, however, Italy holds a lesser detrimental effect on the environment and the extinction of natural habitats due to its reliance on ecological alternatives for energy. This example illustrates the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change, including the extinction of natural habitats and biodiversity loss. It also underscores the vital role every country can play as part of the collective action required to address global warming and protect our planet."},{"question":"Write the next sentence. The rat took fabric from the quilt and put it in the nest, so now the Options: (1). quilt has less material.. (2). nest has less material.. Answer:","response":"1. quilt has less material. Step-by-step justification: 1. The sentence talks about the rat taking fabric from the quilt to put it in the nest. This action directly affects the quilt and nest. 2. Since the rat is getting fabric from the quilt, the quilt will have less material as the fabric is being taken away from it. Therefore, option 1 is consistent with the action mentioned in the sentence. 3. Option 2 states that the nest has less material, which contradicts the sentence's information that fabric is being added to the nest. Hence, option 2 is incorrect. Thus, option 1, \\"quilt has less material,\\" is the correct and consistent continuation of the sentence."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Vampire in Brooklyn Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An abandoned ship crashes into a dockyard in Brooklyn, New York, and the ship inspector, Silas Green, finds it full of corpses. Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a suave, mysterious vampire (who arrived on the ship in his intricately carved coffin), intervenes and kills them. Soon after, Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, before Julius turning into a decaying ghoul and claiming that it has benefits; he then explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon. This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, who is still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, are in the middle of investigating the murders on the ship, Rita begins having strange visions about a woman who looks like her, and begins asking questions about her mother's past. When she tells Justice about having \\"a strange feeling\\" about the investigation, he is skeptical, which frustrates Rita. The visions are presumably influenced in part by her vampire heritage; this is hinted at a few times throughout the first two-thirds of the story. Rita is completely unaware of this heritage, and believes she is losing her mind, similar to what happened to her mother. Meanwhile, Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to find out more about Rita and to further pull her into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook. Max, in these disguises, misleads Rita into thinking Justice slept with Nikki,...

Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"To find out how many pints of coffee Genevieve drank, we first need to figure out how many pints of coffee were in each thermos. There are 2 pints in a gallon. So, 4.5 gallons equal (4.5 * 2) = 9 pints since: 1 gallon = 2 pints We have 18 thermoses, so we'll divide 9 pints by 18 thermoses: 9 pints / 18 thermoses = 0.5 pint per thermos Genevieve drank 3 thermoses, so she drank: 3 thermoses × 0.5 pint per thermos = 1.5 pints In conclusion, Genevieve drank 1.5 pints of coffee."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen were not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 barrels (50 m3) per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government.

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty.

She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed. That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \\"jazz up\\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director. Then, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken). They want Hill to help them close down the gambling racket by recruiting some men from the church to place bets that the agents will watch. Hill cannot find any men to help, but hits upon the idea of using women. Five women from his congregation (and Delany, whose wife does not drive) attempt to place bets in the company of the Treasury agents, but with disastrous clumsiness. The team changes tactics to try to go after the \\"bank\\" that the gangsters use, tailing the mob's deliverymen through town while Hill coordinates using a...

Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things. His heart was not in school, but in the woods. One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \\"Steve! Pay attention!\\" Steve turned to look at her, fixing his eyes on Miss White, as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \\"You all did pretty well,\\" she told the class, \\"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\\" She hesitated, her eyes searching his face. \\"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\\" She just stared at Steve. Steve dropped his eyes. After that, it was war! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained _ \\"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\\" He was unmoved. \\"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\\" Nothing touched him. \\"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\\" Nothing. \\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\\" Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it! Someone cared about him? Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, both parents were out. He, quickly, gathered up a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all smiles! God, she was beautiful! Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Miss White's face was in total shock! The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand knowledge and translate the things... Steve used to be bad at his lessons because _ . A) the teacher blamed him from time to time B) he was not a smart boy in his class C) the test for the seventh grade challenged his confidence D) he hadn't put his heart into his studies Answer:","response":"D) he hadn't put his heart into his studies In the given context, it becomes clear that Steve's struggle with his lessons wasn't due to a lack of intelligence or his teacher's blame. In fact, Miss White declares Steve as the smartest boy in the seventh grade despite his poor performance. The real issue lies in Steve's lack of interest and dedication to his studies. Instead of focusing on school, he daydreams about the woods and doesn't engage with his coursework. This disinterest is demonstrated by his refusal to do homework, even as the punishments become more severe. Steve's turning point comes when Miss White shows genuine concern and care for his future. This unexpected expression of compassion makes him realize that he is not alone, and that there is value in putting effort into his schoolwork. After this, Steve makes a conscious decision to dedicate time and effort to his studies by taking his schoolbooks with him when he spends time in the woods. Upon his return to school, he arrives on time and eagerly completes a quiz on the weekend homework. Miss White is both shocked and proud to see that Steve has passed his first test, indicating that he has finally put his heart into his studies. As a result, Steve's academic performance rapidly improves, and he discovers that he enjoys learning and excelling at school. In conclusion, the primary reason Steve used to be bad at his lessons was that he hadn't put his heart into his studies. It wasn't until he received genuine support and encouragement from Miss White that he became motivated to dedicate himself to school, which clearly demonstrated his true potential as the smartest boy in the seventh grade."},{"question":"Given the following context: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that released Off the Wall?

Feed your frog insects every two or three days. Provide a water dish. Spray the terrarium to increase humidity.","response":"Title: Effective Techniques for Maintaining Frog Health through Optimal Terrarium Conditions and Feeding Step One: Understanding the Topic The summary provided indicates that the article will gravitate around how to maintain a frog's health through appropriate insect-feeding schedules, water provision, and terrarium humidity conditions. To begin with, I will provide some background information on the importance of each element before delving into the specifics of practical application. Final Introduction: Frogs are intriguing animals boasting of unique features and behavior; understanding and catering to their needs results in a thriving and healthy pet. Proper caring involves various factors spanning their diet, hydration, and habitat. This article provides pointers on how to gut-load crickets for feeding, how often to feed your frog insects, the significance of a water dish, and the importance of optimum terrarium humidity. Step Two: Writing About the Importance of Gut-loading Crickets As a first step in the discussion, I will explain what gut-loading is and the benefits it brings to a frog's health. Gut-loading refers to the process of feeding nutritious food to crickets before offering them to frogs. It is important because frogs gain their nutrients mainly from what the insects have consumed. Final Paragraph: Gut-Loading Your Crickets: Enhancing Frog Nutrition Gut-loading is a strategic method of ensuring your frog gets the necessary vitamins and minerals. This process involves feeding crickets with nutrient-rich food before serving them as meals to frogs. Since frogs mainly acquire nutrients from what their prey consumes, gut-loading essentially enhances the nutritional value of their diet. Step Three: Discussing the Frequency of Insect Feeding to Frogs The summary provides a frequency of every two or three days, but it's important to give more context. The feeding frequency varies depending on the frog's size, age, and species. Final Paragraph: The Regularity of Feeding Insects to Frogs: Striking a Healthy Balance Feeding your pet frog insects every two or three days is a general guideline but might change depending on the frog's characteristics. The size, age, and species of a frog can dictate the frequency. For example, younger frogs usually require daily feeding, while some larger species may only need feeding every few days. However, a balance of nutrients is crucial to enhancing a frog's longevity and health. Step Four: Discussing the Importance of Providing a Water Dish Frogs require water both for drinking and maintaining their skin moisture. I will elaborate on the kind of water dish and water type suitable for frogs. Final Paragraph: Considerations in Providing a Water Dish: Essential Hydration for Frogs Having a water dish in the terrarium is essential. Frogs depend on water not only for drinking but also for keeping their skin moist. It is important to choose a shallow dish that is easily accessible, and remember to fill it with dechlorinated water, as frogs are particularly sensitive to chlorine and other chemicals. Step Five: Writing About the Need for Spraying the Terrarium Frogs need a certain level of moisture in the air to stay healthy, and this varies by species. Spraying replicates this humidity. Final Paragraph: Spraying the Terrarium: Ensuring Optimum Humidity Humidity plays a crucial role in a frog's wellbeing. Frogs require a specific humidity level in their atmosphere depending on their species. Spraying the terrarium with water regularly can mimic their natural habitat's wet conditions and help maintain a lush, humid environment that frogs enjoy. In conclusion, caring for frogs is a meticulous process that involves attention to their diet, hydration, and habitat conditions. By adhering to these guidelines, frog owners can take great strides in enhancing their pet's health and happiness."},{"question":"The answer to the question: Who did Santa Anna demand the executions of? is inside the article: The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","response":"Santa Anna demanded the executions of the Texian soldiers who surrendered during the early skirmishes of the Texas Revolution. These soldiers surrendered believing that they would become prisoners of war. However, Santa Anna did not follow this conventional practice of war and instead ordered their executions. This action is exemplified in events like the Goliad Massacre, where nearly 400 Texian prisoners of war were executed under Santa Anna's orders."},{"question":"Denny asked: If \\"Four people in orange vests in a blue inflatable boat with yellow paddles.\\" does that mean that \\"Four people are swimming.\\"?

The band consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Matt Skiba, bassist and co-vocalist Dan Andriano, and drummer Derek Grant. Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, \\"Sundials\\", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Andriano. Context: In 2001, the band released From Here To Infirmary on Vagrant Records. This album inspired music videos for the singles \\"Stupid Kid\\" and \\"Private Eye.\\" The album was the band's first album to reach above Billboard top 200 mark and the first to gross six figures in sales. Their next full-length album was Good Mourning, released in 2003, with the album's launch single \\"We've Had Enough\\" seeing much the same success as the previous single \\"Stupid Kid\\". The album was something of a departure from earlier works, featuring greater production values. The band appeared on various compilation albums, notably Plea for Peace Vol. 1, Vagrant Records: Another Year on the Streets Vol. 1, 2, and 3, and Rock Against Bush Vol. 1. Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano have both independently recorded split records, Skiba with Kevin Seconds on Asian Man Records and Andriano with Mike Felumlee on Double Zero Records, as well as jointly performing backing vocal duties on the album This is Unity Music by Common Rider.

Exercise Reforger was an annual exercise conducted, during the Cold War, by NATO. The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact. 2nd Squadron, 10th Cavalry with the 7th Infantry Division participated in Exercise Reforger in 1984, 1986 and 1993. 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry was activated in the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, in 1977. Ask a question about this article.","response":"The 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army has had a long and storied history dating back to its formation in 1866. One notable period in the unit's history occurred during the Cold War, specifically as a part of the 4th Infantry Division. During this time, the 1st Squadron participated in several iterations of Exercise Reforger from 1977 to 1991 (Reforger stands for REturn of FORces to GERmany). Exercise Reforger was an annually held military exercise conducted by NATO to ensure its ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact, which was the main rival of NATO during the Cold War period. Throughout the various Exercise Reforger events, the 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry acted in numerous capacities as dictated by the objectives of each exercise. These tasks could range from engaging in reconnaissance and security operations to practicing defensive tactics in hypothetical conflict scenarios. By participating in these exercises, the squadron demonstrated its readiness and ability to rapidly deploy to West Germany and collaborate with other NATO forces. The 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, which belonged to the 7th Infantry Division, also held various participation in Exercise Reforger. They took part in the exercises in 1984, 1986, and 1993, which further attests to the importance of maintaining strong and agile forces during the Cold War. Similarly, the 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry was activated within the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, in 1977. The 3rd Battalion contributed to this preparedness as well, although it did not participate in the Reforger exercises mentioned. Exercise Reforger ultimately served to showcase the strong and cohesive nature of NATO forces as they rehearsed various operational scenarios in the European theatre. The 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, as well as other army units such as the 2nd Squadron, 10th Cavalry, and the 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry, all played a significant role in exemplifying the dedication and readiness of U.S. military forces during the Cold War era, ultimately working to maintain peace and stability throughout the NATO alliance.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When it comes to understanding the human mind, there is always an element of mystery and unpredictability. Despite advancements in neuroscience and psychology, we still cannot fully comprehend the inner workings of a person's thoughts and emotions. Some might argue that observing someone's actions, expressions, and gestures can give us a good idea of what they are thinking; however, it's essential to acknowledge the complexity and uniqueness of each individual's mental processes. The notion of the \\"mind-reading\\" is a popular concept in literature and film, but the concept is far from reality. Human beings are intricate creatures with varying levels of cognitive functions, emotional intelligence, and personal experiences that shape their thoughts and feelings in any given situation. Even if we were to monitor the body language and facial expressions of a person, the information we could gather would only provide a superficial understanding of their thoughts and emotions. Moreover, different cultural backgrounds, environmental factors, and upbringing can influence the way people express themselves and experience emotions. For example, research has shown that people belonging to different cultures showcase different expressions for similar emotions. This adds another layer of complexity to understanding someone's thoughts and feelings merely through observing their behavior and expressions. Furthermore, people are often skilled at masking or even faking their emotions to fit into social norms or conceal their true feelings. This makes it difficult to tell what someone may genuinely be thinking by observing their outward cues. Everyone has their coping mechanisms, and appearances can be deceiving. Consequently, the answer to the question, \\"Is it possible to determine the exact contents of someone's mind just by observing their behavior and expressions?\\" would be: it is not possible to tell."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given the beginning and the middle of a three-part story.

But ice cream didn’t always have such a deliciously benign rep. In fact, at the turn of the 20th century, the ice cream parlor was regarded by many as a den of corruption, prostitution, and sin. There was New York, where a man testified to a senate committee in 1895 that he knew of several ice cream parlors that were “really houses of prostitution or disorderly houses.” But Chicago was really the center of the immoral ice cream epidemic—the city had so many problems in ice cream parlors that it passed a curfew law and even forbade the institutions from erecting “curtains, screens, or partitions of any kind that will serve to divide such places into compartments.” In 1911, the city’s vice committee published a report of its activities at ice cream parlors, which included nabbing gropers, flirts, and girls who told boys they “could be had.” But perhaps the most outrageous anti-ice cream parlor screed was published in a 481-page 1909 book called War on the White Slave Trade, in which the Illinois Vigilance Association tore the city’s taste for cool treats to shreds. “One thing should be made very clear to the girl who comes up to the city,” the association warned, “and that is that the ordinary ice cream parlor is very likely to be a spider’s web for her entanglement.” They went on to describe how foreign-owned ice cream establishments were “recruiting stations” for prostitution, where “scores of girls have taken their first steps downward.” Why ice cream parlors? Historian and folklorist Bill Ellis writes that ice cream wasn’t exactly seen as all-American in the early 1900s. Despite its adoption by Americans like Thomas Jefferson, the cold treat was associated with foreign tastes—tastes that were associated with the specter of “white slavery,” a dated term used to described sex trafficking, prostitution, and other kinds of sexual debauchery during the 19th and 20th centuries. Fueled by fear of immigrants, changes in how men and women met and married, and consternation over the relative freedom of working women, the term became a major cause at the turn of the century, and a rallying cry for panicked parents and uptight reformers. Ice cream parlors found themselves in the center of the controversy. Often foreign-owned, the establishments that tried to capitalize on growing leisure time and changing tastebuds found themselves in the crosshairs of moral panic. So did the scoop scare cause ice cream business to dwindle? Not exactly. In a 1914 edition of The International Confectioner, an ice cream expert noted that the industry was already so big it could compete with butter production. “The man who kills the goose that lays the golden egg always has and ever will be called a fool,” he wrote. So much for empty ice cream freezers in those dens of sweet, sweet sin. ||||| How a musical truck hijacked an elite dessert and delivered it to the people. It’s the sound of summer: a string of jangly notes cutting through the sticky-hot air. The response is Pavlovian. Mouths water. Parents reach for their wallets. Kids lace up their shoes and hit the pavement. For Ben Van Leeuwen, it was no different. Growing up in suburban Riverside, Conn., he’d race toward the siren song. The ice cream truck was coming. In the sea of sweaty half-pints elbowing to place orders, Van Leeuwen always took his time. He’d inspect the full menu, pondering each offering, from cartoon-colored Popsicles to animal-shaped treats with gum balls for eyes. He’d imagine the flavors—Strawberry Shortcake, Choco Taco, King Cone. Then he’d pick what he always picked: a Reckless Rainbow Pop Up. “We were poor,” he laughs. The push pop was cheap. Today, Van Leeuwen is an ice cream magnate. With six trucks and three storefronts in New York City, the company he runs with his brother, Pete, and business partner, Laura O’Neill, prides itself on its quality. Handcrafted recipes combine sustainably sourced ingredients from far-flung places: Michel Cluizel chocolate from France, pistachios from Sicily, Tahitian vanilla beans from Papua New Guinea. The flavors have put Van Leeuwen on the vanguard of an ice cream truck resurgence. In a single generation, the ice cream truck has moved upmarket. The history of frozen street treats begins long before Van Leeuwen encountered his first push pop—it begins before even mechanical refrigeration. The very nature of the industry—taking something frozen and hawking it on sultry sidewalks—has always forced ice cream peddlers to innovate. That the cold treat had to come to America before it could move off kings’ tables and into the hands of common folk makes the story that much sweeter. We All Scream for Ice Cream It’s hard to imagine now, but for much of human history, Slurpees and Klondike bars and even the humble Reckless Rainbow would have been considered status symbols. Difficult to obtain and harder to store, ice itself was once a luxury. When the Roman Emperor Nero wanted Italian ice, he ordered it the old-fashioned way—dispatching his servants to fetch snow from mountain tops, wrap it in straw, and bring it back to mix with fruits and honey—a practice still popular with elites in Spain and Italy 1,500 years later. In the fourth century, the Japanese emperor Nintoku was so enamored with the frozen curiosity that he created an annual Day of Ice, during which he presented ice chips to palace guests in an elaborate ceremony. Around the world, monarchs in Turkey, India, and Arabia used flavored ices to punch up the extravagance at banquets, serving frosty bouquets flavored with fruit pulp, syrup, and flowers—often the grand finale at feasts intended to impress. But it wasn’t until the mid-16th century, when scientists in Italy discovered a process for on-demand freezing—placing a container of water in a bucket of snow mixed with saltpeter—that the ice cream renaissance truly began. The innovation spread through European courts, and before long, royal chefs were whipping up red wine slushes, icy custards, and cold almond creams. Italian and French monarchs developed a taste for sorbets. And cooks experimented with every exotic ingredient in their arsenal: violets, saffron, rose petals. But while the excitement for ice cream grew, the treats were clearly reserved for the elite. The dessert needed a trip across the pond and a few more centuries of innovation before it could trickle down to the masses. Ice cream came to America with the first colonists. British settlers brought recipes with them, and the treat found space at the Founding Fathers’ tables. George Washington loved it. Thomas Jefferson was such a fan that he studied the art of ice cream making in France and returned with a machine so he could churn his own flavors at Monticello. But even in this monarch-free land, the frosty desserts were an extravagance. Vanilla and sugar were expensive, and access to ice was limited. To serve the dessert year-round, Jefferson built himself an icehouse, refrigerated with wagonloads of ice harvested from the nearby Rivanna River. Still, even with all the means and materials, the road to producing ice cream was rocky. As food historian Mark McWilliams explains in The Story Behind the Dish, making a scoop was laborious. Cooks had to extract the iced mixture from a frozen pewter bucket, churn and blend it with cream by hand, and place the concoction back into the bucket for additional freezing. To get the desired silky texture, this churning had to be repeated multiple times over days. McWilliams writes, “the process was long and taxing, and thus generally managed by servants or slaves.” Still, there was a market for the product. According to McWilliams, “The labor-intensive process may have restricted ice cream to the wealthy, but it also measured how strongly ice cream was desired.” Everyone wanted a taste. And now, as a new wave of immigrants began looking for something novel to peddle on city streets, working-class people were about to take their licks. The Ice Age In the 1800s, the ice delivery industry exploded. Companies began harvesting frozen rivers and transporting ice to homes at affordable prices. Meanwhile, the technology for hand-crank ice cream makers advanced, making it far easier to scoop sundaes at home. Before long, ice cream was regularly served in parlors and tea gardens across the country. By the 1830s, ice cream’s role as an Independence Day treat was well established. But for the poor urban populations who couldn’t afford July 4th ices or the fresh ingredients to make ice cream at home, immigrant street vendors came to the rescue. Fresh off the boat and with limited job prospects, these innovators used their culinary talents to grasp at the American dream, selling frozen treats from carts chilled with ice. “Italy and France was where ice cream was first truly developed; they made it delicious,” says food writer Laura B. Weiss, author of Ice Cream: A Global History. “In the U.S., they developed the business.” The cheap wooden wagons let proprietors avoid rent and taxes that came with setting up a store. And demand for their wares was always high. One popular treat, called hokey-pokey, was a Neapolitan-striped confection. Made with condensed milk, sugar, vanilla extract, cornstarch, and gelatin, all cut into two-inch squares and wrapped in paper, the bite-sized dessert was the perfect street food. According to Anne Cooper Funderburg’s Chocolate, Strawberry, and Vanilla: A History of American Ice Cream, young children of all ethnicities—Jewish, Irish, Italian—would gather on the cobbled streets of Park Row and the Bowery, heeding the vendors’ melodic call: “Hokey-pokey, sweet and cold; for a penny, new or old.” (“Hokey-pokey” is a mangling of the Italian phrase O che poco, or “Oh, how little.”) Penny licks were also popular among New York’s children and the working class. Before the invention of the ice cream cone, vendors scooped ice cream into a regular glass, which a customer would lick clean. Then they returned the glass to the peddler, who would swish it in a pail before refilling it for the next customer. It was an entirely unsanitary practice. “The mix-ins were bacteria, not chocolate chips,” says Weiss. Alamy But it was the ice cream sandwich that truly melted the social boundaries, as blue and white collars alike huddled around pushcarts on hot summer days. According to an article in the August 19, 1900 edition of The Sun, “[Wall Street] brokers themselves got to buying ice cream sandwiches and eating them in a democratic fashion side by side on the sidewalk with the messengers and the office boys.” In fact, by the mid-1800s, ice cream had become such a common indulgence that Ralph Waldo Emerson warned about America’s bent toward materialism and gluttony, hailing ice cream as a chief example. And he was right: In the 1860s, thousands of New York City peddlers were selling penny licks and ice cream sandwiches to ravenous crowds. “They were really the first ice cream trucks,” says Weiss. “They started ice cream as a street food. It was a walk-around food—you’d stand up and eat it.” Ice cream had become a staple of the American diet—not just for the rich and powerful, but for everybody—and it was about to get even more mobile. On a winter evening in 1920, candy maker Harry Burt was puttering around his ice cream shop in Youngstown, Ohio. Burt had made a name for himself by sticking a wooden handle on a ball of candy to create the Jolly Boy Sucker—a newfangled lollipop. Ready for a bigger challenge, he set out to create an ice cream novelty. He started by mixing coconut oil and cocoa butter to seal a smooth block of vanilla ice cream in the silky chocolate coating. The treat looked good, but it was messy. When his daughter Ruth grabbed for the bar, more of the chocolate coating ended up on her hands than her mouth. So Harry Jr., Burt’s 21-year-old son, came up with a better idea: Why not use the sticks from the lollipops as handles? And with that, the Good Humor bar was born. But Burt wasn’t done innovating yet. A visionary, Burt was intrigued by the era’s technological advances. Prohibition had helped soda fountains and ice cream shops proliferate in place of bars. Fast food like burgers and hot dogs had infiltrated the menus in America’s swelling suburbs. Meanwhile, the Henry Ford–led automobile industry was exploding. To Burt, combining these national trends—fast food and cars—was a no-brainer. He just needed to figure out how to get his portable treat into the hands of hungry kids. In 1920, Burt invested in 12 refrigerator trucks for distribution around the city. He made sure they were pristine white and put professional-looking drivers in signature white uniforms to signify cleanliness and safety to parents. Then he crafted a scheme for luring the kids. “He promised to follow a specified route so families would know when to expect the truck to come by,” says Nick Soukas, director of ice cream for Unilever, which now owns the Good Humor brand. “A bell, which came from Harry Jr.’s bobsled, chimed so everyone would know they could come out and purchase Good Humor bars.” At first, all that ringing drew curious children into the streets to see what the fuss was about, but before long, the sound was synonymous with the ice cream man. Corbis From the 1920s to the ’60s, thousands of Good Humor men patrolled the nation’s neighborhoods, becoming part of the communities they served. Good Humor men inspired a children’s Little Golden Book. In 1965, Time reported, “To the young, he has become better known than the fire chief, more welcome than the mailman, more respected than the corner cop.” When a Westchester County, N.Y., Good Humor man switched routes, 500 neighborhood children signed a petition for his return. But Burt’s truck wasn’t the only game in town. In the 1950s, two brothers from Philadelphia, William and James Conway, were busy dreaming up their own version of a mobile ice cream unit. At the time, soft-serve machines had become popular in soda shops, and the Conways saw no reason they couldn’t go mobile. So they bolted a soft-serve machine to the floor of a truck. On St. Patrick’s Day in 1956, the brothers took their Mister Softee truck on its maiden voyage, handing out green ice cream to excited kids on West Philadelphia streets. “That didn’t really work too well,” says Jim Conway, son of James and current president of Mister Softee. The heat and power of the condensers, generator, and gas engines overwhelmed the early trucks, and the electricity often puttered out. “You’d be in the middle of making someone’s cone, and everything would shut down,” Conway says. “You’d have to open the back doors and wait for the thing to cool.” Perfecting the vehicle proved to be a challenge. The Conways had to experiment with airflow and mitigating heat, using fans and different generators. (Decades later, the company would customize its trucks with innovative rust-free aluminum, General Motors Vortec engines, and high-efficiency Electro Freeze soft-serve machines.) By 1958, the company had become so successful that the brothers began to franchise. Before long, the trademark sailboat-blue and white ice cream trucks were being sold to vendors all over the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The Conways even one-upped the Good Humor bell, hiring Grey Advertising to pen a jingle for the company. By 1960, the “Mister Softee (Jingle and Chimes)” was playing from trucks on a drum-and-spindle contraption, like a roaming music box. A modern day “Hokey Pokey,” Mister Softee’s never-ending ditty became the siren call to a new generation. Getty Images Chasing down the ice cream man on hot summer days wasn’t Ben Van Leeuwen’s only formative experience with ice cream trucks. In 2005, while Van Leeuwen was attending Skidmore College, he rented a retired Good Humor truck and sold the treats with his brother to wealthy Connecticut residents. But Van Leeuwen found that the allure of the treats had faded. “I hated the way they tasted,” he says. The brothers did, however, appreciate the independence of the job. And with organic farmer’s markets blooming all over New York City and the food truck itself enjoying a gourmet reinvention, the brothers saw a modern ice cream market developing. People were increasingly interested in their food’s origins just as they were clamoring for exotic epicurean adventures. In 2008, the brothers rolled out their first truck, painted a vintage faded yellow, after spending a few months developing their first batch of flavors. They were initially too rushed to outfit their truck with speakers. When they realized the silence helped them stand out from Mister Softee’s insistent jingle, they decided to remain music-free. Today, there’s no shortage of entrepreneurs in the ice cream truck market. In San Jose, Calif., Ryan and Christine Sebastian created Treatbot, “a karaoke ice cream truck from the future” that allows customers to eat scoops of Eastside Horchata ice cream while singing Michael Jackson’s “Beat It.” In Tacoma, Cool Cycles Ice Cream Company sells motorcycles with a sidecar freezer that holds 600 ice cream bars. And in New York City, Doug Quint, a classically trained bassoonist, turned a retired Mister Softee truck into the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck, which spun off into a storefront that pairs classic soft serve with toppings like sriracha hot sauce and pumpkin butter. But classicists need not fear. The traditional soft serve truck is in no danger. Although Good Humor phased out its trucks in the late ’70s, today there are more than 400 Mister Softee franchises employing more than 700 trucks across 15 states. Except for the trucks’ tune technology—the jingle is now blasted loud and clear through electronic circuits—they’re unchanged, right down to the classic soft serve menu on the side. “For close to 50 years, that menu board has changed only four times,” Conway says. Keeping tradition close is a big part of the Mister Softee ideal. Whether they’re vintage or modern, classic or creative, ice cream trucks have a seductive allure that’s about more than just ice cream. They summon a particular kind of nostalgia—the sense of freedom and possibility that comes from long, carefree summer days and the particular thrill of having a dollar in your pocket and a long list of treats from which to choose. The ice cream man has basically been doing the same thing for hundreds of years now—exciting crowds by delivering something utterly familiar wrapped in different packages. But there’s comfort in that. Van Leeuwen’s quick to point out that the fan favorite among his elaborately refined offerings isn’t its sweet sticky black rice flavor or its luscious strawberry-beet creation, but vanilla, plain and simple. And as the upper-class crowd packs into the Van Leeuwen shop to sample the gourmet scoops, just one neighborhood over it’s evident how little ice cream has changed. Standing by the Red Hook ball fields, you’ll find immigrants rolling tiny pushcarts filled with flavored ices, chasing their dreams the way so many new Americans have, hawking a dessert of kings at nickel-and-dime prices.

Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\".

Context: Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.

Such a task should assess the individual's ability to predict, analyze, and explain the outcome of various scenarios by applying relevant scientific knowledge. Here is a detailed example of a task that would serve this purpose: Task: Design and Construct a Rube Goldberg Machine Objective: The goal of this task is to assess the individual's understanding of physical principles and their ability to apply this knowledge in designing and constructing a complex machine that performs a simple task, such as popping a balloon or pouring a glass of water, using a series of chain reactions. Description of the task: 1. Conceptualization and planning: - The individual must first come up with a plan for their Rube Goldberg machine. This would involve identifying the end goal (the simple task that the machine will perform) and brainstorming various ideas for chain reactions that would ultimately lead to that end goal. - The person should consider the principles of physics and mechanics throughout their planning process. This may include incorporating elements such as levers, pulleys, inclined planes, and pendulums, as well as considering the conservation of energy, momentum, gravity, and friction. 2. Gathering materials and resources: - After finalizing their conceptual design, the individual must gather the necessary materials and tools required to construct their machine. Materials could include everyday objects such as cardboard, string, marbles, dominoes, cups, etc. - The individual should also ensure that they have access to an appropriate space to build and test their machine, considering potential safety precautions. 3. Construction and testing: - Using their plan and the gathered materials, the individual must construct their Rube Goldberg machine, ensuring that each element aligns correctly and results in the desired reaction. - Throughout the building process, the individual might encounter problems that require them to adapt their design. They should demonstrate physical reasoning abilities in identifying and resolving any issues that arise. - The individual must test their machine through multiple trials to ensure it consistently achieves its end goal. 4. Analysis and evaluation: - Following the successful completion of their Rube Goldberg machine, the individual should analyze the performance to identify potential areas for improvement or optimization. - They must also evaluate how well various physical principles were applied and how these principles influenced the success of the machine. This task requires a deep understanding of physical principles, hands-on skills, problem-solving abilities, creativity, and patience. In completing this task, an individual will demonstrate strong physical reasoning skills by applying fundamental concepts of physics and mechanics to create a functional and efficient machine. The planning, construction, troubleshooting, testing, and evaluating stages of the task provide ample opportunity for the individual to showcase their physical reasoning capabilities."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: The Hills Have Eyes 2 Movie plot: A captive womanâforced to breed mutant childrenâgives birth to a stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves.

Rather than my internalised misery, I tried to put a sense of optimism into the lyrics by writing about things that we find really inspiring.\\" Said Wire, taking inspiration from David Bowie and seen as almost an escape and a wave of optimism, just like the previoous album was described. On the other hand \\"Distant Colours\\" was written by James Dean Bradfield, rather than Nicky Wire, and inspired by disenchantment and Nye Bevan's old Labour. He said: \\"Musically, the verse is downcast and melancholic and the chorus is an explosion of disillusionment and tears.\\" The third single \\"Dylan & Caitlin\\" was released as a download on 9 March 2018.

Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","response":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis into their core components. Premise: 1. Young girl 2. Serves food 3. Man in burgundy shirt Hypothesis: 1. Girl 2. Throwing knives 3. Man in yellow shirt Now, let's compare the components of the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Both mention a girl; however, the premise specifies a \\"young\\" girl, whereas the hypothesis does not mention age. 2. The premise describes the girl as serving food, while the hypothesis states she's throwing knives. These actions are fundamentally different and not related. 3. The man in the premise is wearing a burgundy shirt, whereas the man in the hypothesis is wearing a yellow shirt. These are different colors, indicating they might be different men or, at the very least, a different scenario. Given the above analysis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

Answer:","response":"False"},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. I am facing a new situation today: Two geology students had an exam on plate tectonics. Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Answer:","response":"Bobby knew more about seafloor spreading. Step 1: Identify the topic of the question The question is asking about seafloor spreading, which is a specific phenomenon related to plate tectonics. Step 2: Recall information from the background article The background article specifically discusses seafloor spreading and its connection to continental drift, as well as the processes that occur at spreading ridges, like the formation of new seabed and the presence of hydrothermal vents. Step 3: Evaluate the students' knowledge based on the given information Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, and seafloor spreading is a direct result of divergent plates moving away from each other. Nate, on the other hand, was more confident in explaining convergent plates, which involve plates moving toward each other and do not directly cause seafloor spreading. Step 4: Determine which student knew more about seafloor spreading Since seafloor spreading is associated with divergent plates, Bobby's knowledge of divergent tectonic plates would make him more knowledgeable about seafloor spreading compared to Nate, who focused on convergent plates."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: dress, family, occasion","response":"Before I write the sentence, let me think of the structure and how to connect these words meaningfully: Step 1: Identify the subject of the sentence In this case, family is the subject, as they would be the ones to attend the occasion.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Madame White Snake is like a magical lady who is really, really pretty, and her beauty can sometimes cause problems for the people who fall in love with her. Now, someone asks: \\"What are the two incarnations of Madame White Snake?\\" We can say that she appears as the pretty lover of Toyoo in one story and the enchanting lover of Hsü in another story.

His fingertips felt clumsy as he tried to navigate the screen, accidentally opening apps he didn't intend to use and struggling to type without a physical keyboard. One day, as Chris sat at his desk, frustration mounting, his coworker Samantha walked over. A tech-savvy individual who could type even faster on a touchscreen than a standard keyboard, Samantha had noticed Chris's struggles over the past few weeks. \\"Hey Chris, it looks like you're having a bit of trouble with that tablet. Do you need any help?\\" she asked, genuinely concerned. Chris sighed, knowing that he couldn't deny the offer for assistance, no matter how much it hurt his pride. \\"Yeah, I just can't seem to get the hang of this thing. It's like my fingers have a mind of their own when I use it.\\" Samantha chuckled, understanding Chris's predicament. \\"Don't worry, I've got your back. I'll show you a few tricks to make using a tablet feel more natural.\\" Over the next hour, Samantha patiently guided Chris through different techniques and shortcuts, demonstrating how to swipe, pinch, and tap in order to execute certain actions with precision. She even helped Chris install a keyboard app that featured customizable options, allowing for a more familiar and intuitive typing experience. As they practiced together, Chris gradually became more comfortable using the tablet. Gone were the accidental app launches; his typing speed slowly increased. Much to his surprise, Chris found that the tablet actually had some advantages over a traditional computer setup, especially when it came to portability and versatility. In the days that followed, Chris continued to improve, thanks to Samantha's coaching and the newfound confidence that came with his newfound skills. He started to use the tablet not only for work, but also for personal tasks and entertainment. At work, Chris started using the tablet to keep track of his schedule, set reminders, and stay up-to-date on the latest industry news. He also discovered several productivity apps designed specifically for tablet users, allowing him to complete tasks and collaborate with his team more efficiently. As a result, his daily workflow was no longer plagued with tech-related challenges and his overall performance improved. Outside of work, Chris began to appreciate the true versatility of the tablet. At home, he could use it to stream movies and shows, play games to relax, or browse the internet while lounging on his couch. He also found that the tablet was perfect for traveling, whether it was casual browsing on public transportation or working remotely from a hotel room. In time, Chris felt incredibly grateful to Samantha for helping him adapt to the tablet environment. She had not only saved him from tech-induced stress but had also opened up new possibilities and avenues for learning. It seemed as though the days when Chris felt hindered and frustrated by technology were finally behind him. As technology continued to advance, Chris was no longer the reluctant adopter he once was. He embraced new products and updates with more confidence, curiosity, and enthusiasm. He even discovered a passion for helping others overcome similar struggles, sharing the knowledge and tips he’d accumulated along the way. Chris's journey from maladaptive tablet-user to capable and tech-savvy individual illustrated that, with some patience, determination, and the right guidance, overcoming personal obstacles was possible. It is a human-centered approach to technology that can truly make a difference in someone's life, and Chris's transformation proved that to be true."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that contradict each other.

Can you fix that?","response":"Observing your statements, the paragraphs have been modified with necessary uppercase and punctuation marks for a more formal presentation, adhering closely to standard English rules: \\"And I never interfere with what you do, even when it’s not in your best interests, when you stray from what you had chosen to do. I do know your choices—I learned them when you put them in your soul contracts.\\" The phrase begins with an upward case \\"And\\", symbolizing the start of the sentence. The words \\"I\\" are consequently capitalized in both sentences due to English grammar regulations since \\"I\\" is always written in uppercase, signifying oneself. The latter part, \\"I learned them when you put them in your soul contracts,\\" also begins with an upward case \\"I\\". Additionally, a hyphen is used to connect two related thoughts or conditions in a sentence and makes it more coherent and readable. This conveys the action of learning caused by the act stated in the second part of the sentence. For good measure, punctuation has been modified. A comma is put up after \\"do\\" to specify, and following \\"interests\\" to indicate the inception of a conditional clause. The full-stop at the end of sentences delineates the conclusion of a distinct thought or idea, indicating that the message intended to be delivered has been precisely dispatched. Proper capitalization and punctuation grant clarity, emphasizing the tone and intent, thereby improving comprehension and readability. They immensely assist in delivering the right articulation and are fundamental to effective communication."},{"question":"Coming off their Bye Week, the Cardinals went home for a Week 10 fight with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as kicker Mike Vanderjagt nailed a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Cardinals' year-long struggles continued as QB Tony Romo completed a 30-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton. The Cards would respond with a 28-yard field goal by kicker Neil Rackers. Afterwards, Vanderjagt gave the Cowboys some breathing room with a 38-yard field goal as time ran out on the half. In the third quarter, things continued to get worse for Arizona as Romo completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Dallas would wrap up the game with RB Marion Barber's 5-yard TD run. The Cardinals would get a touchdown as QB Matt Leinart got a 3-yard TD run. However, the Cards would drop their eighth-straight game. With the loss, the Cardinals fell to 1-8.

There were two running touchdowns - one for 5 yards (Marion Barber) and another for 3 yards (Matt Leinart), totaling 8 yards. To find out how many more yards were from passing touchdowns compared to running touchdowns, we can subtract the total running touchdown yards from the total passing touchdown yards: 81 yards (passing touchdowns) - 8 yards (running touchdowns) = 73 yards So, there were 73 more yards from passing touchdowns compared to running touchdowns in this game."},{"question":"After giving nearly 5,000 people a second chance at life, doctors are celebrating the 25th anniversary of Britian's first heart transplant which was performed at Cambridgeshire's Papworth Hospital in 1979.

A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

They are intrigued and slightly overwhelmed by the extravagant lifestyles around them. Their new neighbor, the enigmatic and immensely wealthy Ron Elstrom, invites them to a grand pool party to warmly welcome them into the neighborhood. The movie unfolds on the day of the party. Ilene and Burt prepare to mingle with their new neighbors, both excited yet nervous. They step into Elstrom's sprawling estate, where a massive, ridiculously luxurious pool shimmers under the glow of numerous flambeaux. Everyone in attendance is glammed up, indulging in ritzy cocktails, and diving into the pool that is the centerpiece of the spectacle. The pool isn’t just a water structure; it's a symbol of the lavish lives of the rich and influential residents of the neighborhood. As the night wears on, Burt, a less-than-enthusiastic swimmer, gets pushed into the pool recklessly by a party-goer. This sparks off a situation where misunderstandings ensue, fueled by the excessive poolside glamour and alcohol. Burt's mishap triggers a chain of enthralling, comical, and dramatic events, inadvertently revealing the secrets and true colors of the wealth-flaunting neighborhood. The pool party serves as a life-sized fishbowl, plunging Ilene and Burt deeply into the curious lives of their neighbors.

Given the context: What will Casey want to do next? A:","response":"Though I cannot predict individual human behavior with absolute certainty, Casey will likely consider a variety of actions following her breakup with Austin, considering that he cheated on her. Based on common reactions to similar situations, I can provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis of possible next steps that Casey may want to take. 1. Emotional reflection and processing: Casey may need time to process the complex emotions that arise after a breakup, especially one involving cheating. She may feel anger, sadness, betrayal, confusion, and disappointment. It is essential for her to understand and validate these emotions to make sense of the situation and heal moving forward. 2. Seeking support from loved ones: To navigate through this emotional turmoil, Casey may want to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist. These sources of support can provide a safe space for her to share her feelings, gain new perspectives, and receive guidance on how to cope with the breakup. 3. Focusing on self-care and personal growth: Taking time for self-care and focusing on individual needs can help Casey in her healing journey. Incorporating exercise, adopting healthy eating habits, engaging in hobbies, and setting personal goals may all contribute to her emotional well-being following the breakup. 4. Establishing boundaries and cutting ties with Austin: Casey may choose to establish clear boundaries with Austin to protect her from further emotional harm. This may involve cutting off any form of communication, unfollowing or blocking him on social media, and deciding whether or not to maintain mutual friendships. 5. Reflecting on the relationship and learning from the experience: Casey might want to examine her previous relationship with Austin to determine if there were any patterns or red flags that she may have overlooked. Gaining insights from this process will help her to make better choices and improve her future relationships. 6. Seeking closure: In some cases, Casey may want to have a final conversation with Austin to express her feelings, seek answers, or simply close the chapter on their relationship. This can provide an opportunity for both parties to gain closure and move forward. 7. Gradually moving on: Once Casey feels ready, she may want to consider moving on with her life, rebuilding her sense of self, and potentially exploring new romantic connections. However, it is crucial that she does so at her own pace and ensures that she is emotionally ready for a new relationship. In conclusion, Casey is likely to engage in a combination of these potential actions, according to her personality, support system, and personal preferences. Her primary focus should be on healing and self-growth, allowing her to emerge from this experience stronger and more self-aware."},{"question":"Complete: i waited even longer in the wine cellar itself , though i felt far more secure within the quiet room , free of witnesses . finally , gerard touraine descended the steps to the corridor and entered the wine cellar with his lantern . \`\` monsieur touraine , '' i whispered . he whirled about , wrinkling his brows as he held up the","response":"lantern to peer into the dimly lit space. \\"Qui est là?\\" he demanded, his voice rough and impatient, betraying a sense of discomfort and unease.

Problem: a sum of money at simple interest amounts to rs . 815 in 3 years and to rs . 878 in 4 years . the sum is : Options: a ) 500 , b ) 698 , c ) 626 , d ) 910 , e ) none A:","response":"To answer the given multiple-choice question, let's first understand the relationship between the sum, interest, and the amount. We are given that a sum of money at simple interest amounts to Rs. 815 in 3 years and Rs. 878 in 4 years. Let's denote the principal amount (the sum) as P, the interest rate as R, and the time period t in years. The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * t) / 100 We can modify this formula to calculate the amount (A) at the end of the time period: A = P + SI = P + (P * R * t) / 100 We have two cases here: when t = 3 and t = 4. Case 1: t = 3, Amount (A) is Rs. 815 815 = P + (P * R * 3) / 100 Case 2: t = 4, Amount (A) is Rs. 878 878 = P + (P * R * 4) / 100 Let's subtract Case 1 from Case 2: 878 - 815 = [P + (P * R * 4) / 100] - [P + (P * R * 3) / 100] Which simplifies to: 63 = (P * R) / 100 Now, we know that the difference in years between the two cases is 1 year. This means that Rs. 63 is the simple interest earned for one year, which also specifies that the annual interest earning from the principal amount (P * R) / 100 remains constant. Therefore, we can calculate the simple interest for 3 years (the first case) by multiplying the annual interest (Rs. 63) by 3: Simple Interest for 3 years = Rs. 63 * 3 = Rs. 189 Now, we can calculate the principal amount (P) using the first case equation, where the Amount after 3 years (A) is Rs. 815: Amount (A) = P + Simple Interest P = Amount (A) - Simple Interest = Rs. (815 - 189) = Rs. 626 So, the sum of money (principal amount) is Rs. 626, which corresponds to option 'c'. The correct answer is: A: c ) 626"},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The two sides had discussed holding talks to resolve the Qatar crisis, which has seen Doha cut off from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. However, Saudi Arabia then accused Qatar of distorting facts about the call, and said it was ending talks. The four countries say Qatar supports terrorism - something Doha denies. The row led to all four Arab nations cutting ties with Qatar on 5 June - Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, while all four countries cut air and sea links with the country. Friday's phone call, which came after US President Donald Trump spoke separately with both sides, had initially been seen as a possible breakthrough in the crisis. The call was the first formal contact between Riyadh and Doha since the crisis began. State media on both sides reported that Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had discussed the need for dialogue to resolve the crisis. Who said what? The Saudi Press Agency said Qatar's leader had \\"expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries\\", and that further details would be announced after Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. Meanwhile, the Qatar News Agency said the Saudi crown prince had proposed assigning \\"two envoys to resolve controversial issues in a way that does not affect the sovereignty of states\\". Shortly afterwards, Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of not being \\"serious\\" about dialogue, and said communications between the two sides would be suspended. The row appears to be over protocol - observers say Saudi Arabia is angered that Qatari state media did not make clear that the call was initiated by Doha. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE, who are blockading Qatar, have presented a list of conditions for the lifting of sanctions. They include the closure of news broadcaster Al-Jazeera and reducing ties with Iran. The group accuses the Qatari-funded channel of fostering extremism, a charge the network denies. Diplomatic efforts led by Kuwait and backed by Western powers have so far failed to end the dispute. On Friday, Mr Trump spoke with both sides, and the UAE, in an attempt to broker talks. \\"The president underscored that unity among the United States' Arab partners is essential to promoting regional stability and countering the threat of Iran,\\" the White House said in a statement.

Sam Roffe, President of Roffe & Sons Pharmaceuticals, dies in what appears to be a climbing accident, leaving his daughter Elizabeth a billion-dollar empire. Roffe's board members see an opportunity to settle old scores, jockey for higher position, and reap lucrative profits. However, an investigation into Sam's death discloses that it was a murder and that a power struggle is going on within the company. Lead investigator Max Hornung informs Elizabeth of his list of suspects, which includes her closest advisers and financially strapped family members. During this time, she marries CEO Rhys Williams, but he, too, is identified by Hornung as a suspect. As president, Elizabeth follows her father's wishes and refuses to let shares of Roffe & Sons sell on the world market. Her choice prevents the board members from selling their shares as the company's by-laws prohibit it until all board members agree; on the other hand, her death would allow for a unanimous decision. After several attempts on her life, an international chase across Europe ensues. Hornung is able to connect these murder attempts to a series of homicides of prostitutes, which have been recorded on snuff films using Roffe film stock with a witness in a black Gucci leather coat (several suspects are linked to this coat). Elizabeth returns to her father's villa in Sardinia during a scirocco for protection from the unseen murderer, who sets her house on fire after she begins destroying objects and shouting, \\"Now try to make it look like an accident!\\" Williams and one of the shareholders, Sir Alec Nichols, both show up to save her, but Hornung figures out that Nichols is the killer and shoots him before he can murder Elizabeth in a symbolic snuff film.","response":"The first name of the person whose death would allow for a unanimous board decision is Elizabeth."},{"question":"What is an example of a tweet?","response":"A tweet is a short message that people write on a social media platform called Twitter.

Why is it illegal to tie a noose? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"1. Is it illegal to tie a noose? Well, just tying a noose by itself isn't illegal, like when you're practicing knots or using it for something safe. But if someone uses a noose to scare or hurt another person, or as a symbol of hate or racism, that can be illegal. It's important to be kind and respectful with everything we do. 2. Why is it illegal to tie a noose? It's not the tying part that's illegal, but how some people choose to use the noose. If the noose is used to threaten someone or promote hate and racism, that's when it becomes a problem and can be illegal. We should always use things in a way that doesn't hurt or scare others. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? No, these questions are different.

Question: What is Jennifer forced to view? Movie title: Captivity Movie plot: A young man is being tortured. Two tubes are inserted into his nose, and truck battery acid is pumped in through one pipe, causing blood to pour out through the other. The man's captor then kills him with a large hammer. Jennifer Tree (Elisha Cuthbert), a young fashion model and cover girl, had captured the attention of photographers and for better or worse, the public at large. On an evening out alone, Jennifer is stalked and drugged. She wakes in a stupor to find herself captive and confined to a cell. A series of metal bins and numbered lockers abruptly swing open in front of her. They contain personal items taken from her apartment. She is forced to view videotapes containing images of the victims who were tortured previous to her captivity, as well as videotaped interviews she had given to the media in the past. Realizing there is no way out, Jennifer pleads and screams to anyone who might hear her. During her confinement, she is subjected to various forms of psychological torture. Jennifer eventually finds she is not alone. A young man, Gary (Daniel Gillies), is being held captive in an adjoining cell. The two make contact and try to find out why they are being held. After watching the horrific scene, they find their way out. They both make it to a garage where they find a car. As soon as they are about to start it, a gas erupts in the car making them both unconscious. They find themselves back in their cells where Jennifer sees a tape of Gary being taken and tied to a chair with a gun held under his chin. After a while of Jennifer worrying, she sees Gary being thrown into his cell. She rushes to him and helps him. After having consensual sex, Gary awakens to find Jennifer, who has been drugged once again. He takes out a key to an adjoining cell. After Gary awakens he discovers Jennifer had drunk a bottle of water that had a drug in it to put her to sleep.

Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Captivity,\\" Jennifer Tree is forced to view videotapes that contain a few different things. First, the tapes show images of the victims who were tortured before she was taken into captivity. These images are graphic and disturbing, showing the cruel and painful experiences these individuals went through at the hands of their captors. The tapes are intended to instill fear and despair in Jennifer, potentially making her feel even more helpless in her situation. In addition to the footage of previous victims, Jennifer is also forced to watch videotaped interviews she had given to the media in the past. This seems to be an attempt by her captor to remind her of her past life and the fame she once enjoyed, highlighting the contrast between her former life and the terrifying reality of her current situation. By forcing Jennifer to watch these tapes, her captors are adding another layer of psychological torture to her confinement. Throughout the movie, Jennifer is subjected to various other forms of psychological torture, all intended to break her spirit and keep her submissive. However, she eventually discovers she is not alone, as a young man named Gary is being held captive with her. Together, they attempt to escape, going through a series of trials and tribulations, which ultimately leads Jennifer to discover the true nature of her captors and their motives. In conclusion, Jennifer Tree is forced to view a combination of videotapes containing images of previous torture victims and her past interviews. These are intended to psychologically torment her and exacerbate her feelings of helplessness while she is held captive."},{"question":"Question: how much does cloud 10 cost wikipedia I found the following answer on Google: Synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds.

With so many confusing headlines hitting your inboxes on a daily basis and the dreaded Christmas shopping to come, here’s an early tonic to focus into 2013. A top eight ‘risks, ruses and rumblers’ for energy in 2013. Here goes: 1) Risk: MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles Hardly new I know, but no matter what any investment house tells you on benchmark prices, we’re stuck in a 50-150/b world, that’s defined by whichever part of the supply-demand balance proves to be most dysfunctional at any one time. The key supply side risk remains the Middle East. The political debris from 2011-12 will continue into 2013 and beyond, with popular pressures continually growing. That’s not just in the Arab Nationalist Republics such as Egypt, where vocal demonstrators on Tahrir Square have made clear President Morsi needs to deliver the goods or else. Or indeed Syria, whose internal implosion will have increasingly regional effects: But in Gulf Monarchy’s as well. The trigger point to watch is all about political secession. The exact timings are by definition uncertain, but Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and most importantly Saudi Arabia, are in the same boat. If the old secession model passing power from one aging leader to another is seen to be broken, then prices will rapidly lift when the Arab Street erupts. The fact that Saudi Arabia has a very ‘awkward neighbourhood’, with deep seated problems in Bahrain, Yemen and Iraq hardly helps its own Eastern Province either. Forget ‘Arab Spring’; think ‘Salafist Séance’. 2) Risk: Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices Holding things together in the Middle East will in large part depend on maintaining high oil prices in the first place. Given likely Eurozone failures, a realisation that the U.S. debt position is unsustainable, and daunting domestic challenges in India, Brazil and China to head off hard landings, then demand side fundamentals all point towards two digit oil prices. Having made over 1.115trillion in 2012, you could be excused for thinking OPEC would have ample wiggle room to buy themselves more political time; not so. 100/b is no longer deemed expensive across OPEC ranks, but a necessary price for regime survival. Besides notoriously overstretched patronage states like Algeria, Nigeria, Venezuela or Iran, even Gulf States are starting to feel the pinch. There are no true price moderates left in the oil cartel, merely gradations of hawks. The geopolitical cost of survival is what matters, and it’s seriously out of sync with the geological cost of production. Bottom line: It’s 100/b or bust for petro-states. While it’s true that most recessions since the 1970s have been preceded by oil price spikes, OPEC has never been very good at heading the lessons of demand destruction, and with emerging markets dominating the headlines, it is unlikely to do better now. Most producer states will be caught seriously short if this happens. Russia will be first out of the money, Central Asian budgets will be squeezed and MENA producers will have to make uncomfortable trade-offs. Latin America is in no better shape, no matter whether you look at Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador or indeed Brazil. In a back to (conventional) basics scenario, the bulk of producer states will go for volume over price, in the hope that the Saudis will do the heavy lifting to set a viable floor. Riyadh might play ball for a while, but it’s unlikely to stop producer states reverting to what they know best as a short term coping mechanism: ‘blunt repression’. Whether that works or not remains to be seen, but if nothing else, we could see a ‘2013 paradox’ of heightened instability across producer states underpinning prices as panic sets in. Pleasant OPEC meetings in Vienna will be irrelevant to the political unrest sweeping producer states. ‘Cyclical’ will take on a whole new meaning as far price and political instability is concerned – the lower the price, the more likely we will see supply disruptions as more vulnerable producers opt for a Libyan or Syrian course. Watch out for Iraq on that score; Kurdish plays look good right now, but Baghdad is unlikely to give up the Northern ghost without a fight – Sunni factions could easily get caught in the crossfire. 3) Ruse: Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head Amid all this, Iran will be the nuclear dog that doesn’t bark. Sanctions will remain in place, with the U.S. turning the screw a little harder around June presidential elections in Tehran. The Iranian’s will increase their bluster around the Strait of Hormuz in response, not to mention continuing to vie for regional influence across the Gulf, and especially in Syria, Bahrain and Iraq. But for all the huffing and puffing in Washington and Tehran, the nuclear question will remain a stalemate. As long as Iran can find Eastern outlets for its crude, the only way the nuclear clock is stopped is by impatience, miscalculation or misreading of intent that prompts somebody (aka Tel Aviv), to hazard a high risk first move. That’s an unlikely prospect given the political factors in play, Iran will be deferred to 2014 or 2015. Traders who don’t ‘get that’; expect to get burnt. 4) Rumbler: Russia Goes To Internal Energy War Classically Russian, but in the midst of extreme market uncertainty, the main wars they’ll be fighting are internal between Rosneft and Gazprom. It’s quite clear after the TNK-BP deal that Rosneft has become the new national champion of choice, producing up to 4.6mb/d (taking overall state control of hydrocarbon output to over 50%). How well Rosneft performs remains to be seen, as does the amount of international capital Russia can attract into Arctic plays, but it’s Gazprom that’s the canary in the Moscow mineshaft here. After pursuing endless political goals such as Nord Stream (and nascent South Stream pipelines), Gazprom failed to respond to the most fundamental ‘fundamental’ of all; the unconventional gas world developing around them. To remain a ‘market maker’ rather than price taker, Gazprom had to get out of petty pipeline politics and into serious quantities of LNG. That never happened, and with most Russian fields now looking horribly expensive to develop, Gazprom will need to fork out over 45bn per anum over the next five years. That doesn’t bode particularly well for the Kremlin to fall back on gas revenues, especially if shale plays and LNG continue to cut international market share. Gazprom only contributes 7% of total state revenues, a figure that will be squeezed into 2013. But the competition isn’t just coming from overseas, but directly from Rosneft. Igor Sechin’s outfit has already secured a 25 year gas supply agreement with Inter RAO (the state electricity provider), next stop will be going after Gazprom’s gas export monopoly. That spells trouble for Gazprom, and indeed private players such as Novatak. Gazprom gets left holding the European baby, playing regional pipeline politics, while Rosneft performs a global energy role. As the battle unfolds, expect Russian production to suffer in the interim and for Moscow to fall back on its free-rider role wherever possible. Hostilities will be brutal, but Rosneft is likely to be the long term winner. Civil war is an ugly thing, and especially so in Russia. 5) Rumbling Risk: American Schizophrenia Sets In Then we have America. It’s been the trail blazer for shale gas gains over the past decade, and’s increasingly replicating the ‘revolution’ for liquids. As everyone knows, U.S. shale gas gains have turned gas into a perennial buyers’ market, so much so that henry hub prices have become a victim of their own success. The key question in 2013 is not whether America will maintain its number one (650bcm) gas slot, but how much it intends to export as LNG? Those expecting the floodgates to open next year could be disappointed; any volumes signed off in Washington will keep a very keen eye on domestic prices. Of the 125bcm/y of LNG trains awaiting FERC approval, 40-50bcm would be remarkably good going. But even if America gets cold LNG feet, price convergence will slowly continue to play out across the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. The mere prospect of U.S. liquidity hitting the market has been seized upon by Asian buyers, with the upshot that Washington’s virtual impact on the gas world will be far larger than its physical presence in 2013. That’s not particularly great news for global energy companies trying to develop expensive LNG projects in West Africa, East Africa and Australia, but as the old adage from abundant energy goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’. Qatar and Russia serve as the perfect case in point, rueing the slow, but painful death of oil indexed prices for gas. In terms of liquids, America will probably push towards 11.5mb/d production next year. That means very different things to different people. It’s ‘energy independence nirvana’ for some, especially those willing to lump the Americas all under a single Washington production figure. When President Obama signs off the Keystone XI pipeline in 2013 the narrative will gain far greater traction, even though it’s actually the first step towards fixing WTI prices back towards international benchmarks. That’s chilling news for OPEC of course, not because America can play any kind of swing producer role, but because of the collateral damage it will do to oil prices. Where things get considerably worse for the cartel, is not only that the Americas will use Washington as a production hedge to send tankers East, (Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico all know that relying on a single source of supply and single source of demand is a no brainer), but that Beijing will continue to go ‘long’ in the Americas to make sure they remain firmly tied into global energy markets. Just as China is strategically investing in any cost overruns on LNG plays right now, it’s going to do exactly the same for liquids. Why? Because China wins most from a cheap and abundant energy world. 2013 will mark a transitional step towards that outcome; the vexed Nexen deal will be the watershed moment underpinning Chimerica’s physical and virtual stake in the game. But a word of caution for Beijing, political risk is just as lethal, if not more so in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Just ask BP. 6) Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind The perceived U.S. upside from its energy gains is that it no longer has to do all the heavy lifting for global energy supplies. True enough; but the blunt fact to consider is that two-thirds of global oil supplies are still sitting on politically shaky ground, and doing so in an increasingly large external power vacuum in the Middle East. The vacuum will get significantly bigger as US power (and interest) ebbs and Chinese oil flows, albeit without overarching political or security guarantees in place. It also had the distinct potential for conflict should Washington and Beijing end up misreading each other’s actions. Both of whom remain OPEC price takers at this stage.","response":"The article entitled \\"The Top Eight Energy Risks For 2013\\" outlines eight major challenges, risks and uncertainties that the global energy sector faced in 2013. 1. MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles: The article stated that political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) posed a substantial risk to energy prices and supplies. The instability due to secession struggles in the Arab Nationalist Republics and Gulf Monarchies could lead to supply disruptions and sharp price increases. 2. Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices: This pointed to the potential for oil producer states to react poorly to falling oil prices, possibly employing repression to maintain control. Unstable global economic factors were likely to push oil prices down, shaking the economic stability of these states and potentially causing them to make difficult trade-offs. 3. Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head: The article discussed how Iran's unresolved nuclear issue could affect energy markets, facing significant sanctions and pressure during its presidential elections. However, any drastic change regarding this matter was unlikely to happen in 2013. 4. Russia Goes To Internal Energy War: There was a risk in 2013 that internal battles between Russian energy companies Rosneft and Gazprom could affect energy production. 5. American Schizophrenia Sets In: The article discussed the potential for mixed consequences due to America's success with shale gas. While it created a buyer's market for gas and held potential for higher export numbers, the risk of an oversaturated market and falling prices lingered. Additionally, the quest for energy independence could affect international oil prices and dynamics. 6. Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind: The sixth risk referred to geopolitical power vacuums, especially in the Middle East, that could pose substantial challenges to the global energy market. It pointed out a potential for conflict between the US and China, both of which were dependent on OPEC's oil. The article did not explicitly enumerate the 7th and 8th risks, but it can be inferred that these risks involved intricacies of international politics, market fluctuations, price indexes and the challenging dynamics between supplier states, consumer states and geopolitical power-blocs."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Antioquia Department, country, Colombia; Bandeja paisa, ingredient, Avocado; Avocado, family, Lauraceae; Bandeja paisa, region, Antioquia Department.

A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen. Answer:","response":"The three children of the stubborn and stern patriarch, Grug, in the cave family called the Croods are: 1.

The first sentence discusses how the Internet impacts the expansion of the market as a whole, benefiting businesses by providing them with a larger market to compete within. However, this statement does not provide specific information about any particular business or group of businesses and their sales distribution channels. The second sentence claims that the majority of sales for an unspecified business or group of businesses are made on the Internet. While Sentence 1 suggests that the Internet may indeed be a significant factor in many businesses' sales, it does not provide evidence to support the idea that the majority of their sales are made online.

To elaborate further, seed dispersal is a crucial process in the life cycle of plants, as it allows them to reproduce by spreading their seeds far and wide, increasing their chances of survival and propagation. Seed dispersal occurs through various agents, including wind, water, explosion, and animals. In the context of seed dispersal by animals, which is also known as zoochory, animals often play a vital role in the plant's reproductive process by transporting seeds a considerable distance from the parent plant. This can occur in several ways: 1. Endozoochory: This is the process by which animals eat the fruit or plant structure containing the seeds, and these seeds remain undamaged during digestion. The seeds are later released in the animals' droppings, often far away from the parent plant, which can lead to new plants growing in the area. Examples of animals engaged in endozoochory include birds, mammals like monkeys and bears, and large herbivores like deer and elephants. 2. Epizoochory: In this type of seed dispersal, the seeds attach themselves to the external surface of animals, like their fur, feathers, or skin. They remain attached during the animal's movement and eventually fall off or are rubbed off at a different location. This form of seed dispersal is common among various plant species, including grasses and small herbaceous plants. Examples of animals involved in epizoochory include mammals with fur or woolly coats, such as cattle or sheep, and even insects like butterflies and bees. 3. Scatter-hoarding: Many animals collect and store seeds for future consumption. Rodents like squirrels and chipmunks, as well as birds like Jay and the nutcracker, are commonly involved in this behavior. As these animals bury or hide seeds in multiple locations to retrieve later, they often forget some of these storage locations, allowing the seeds to germinate and grow into new plants. 4. Caching: Some animals, like the acorn woodpecker, bury seeds individually or cache them in specific locations. These birds bore holes into trees, fence posts, or telephone poles, where they store acorns for later consumption. In doing so, they may inadvertently disperse seeds, as the acorns may fall out of the storage holes and germinate. In summary, an example of seed dispersal is animals eating fruits or plant structures containing seeds. This process is crucial for the successful reproduction and distribution of various plant species through the mechanisms of endozoochory, epizoochory, scatter-hoarding, and caching, which all rely on animal behavior."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given dvd product reviews in French language.
