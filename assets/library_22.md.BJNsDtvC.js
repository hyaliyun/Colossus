Input: OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence and clinical associations of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia in a population-based sample of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A validated questionnaire was administered to 656 patients with type 1 diabetes over a 6-month period to determine hypoglycemia awareness status. Case ascertainment was 79% of the clinic population. The rate of severe hypoglycemia was determined by data collected prospectively in the preceding year. RESULTS Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia was present in 29% of patients. Patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia had an earlier onset of diabetes (P < 0.001), were younger (P < 0.001), and had lower mean levels of A1C since diabetes onset (P = 0.006) and at their last visit (P = 0.001). The overall rate of severe hypoglycemia was 24.5 episodes per 100 patient-years in the preceding year. The severe hypoglycemia rate was higher in those with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (37.1 vs. 19.3 episodes per 100 patient-years, P < 0.001). Among patients aged <6 years (n = 46), 59% of care providers reported impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, and the rate of severe hypoglycemia was significantly higher in those reporting impaired awareness (33.3 vs. 52 episodes per 100 patient-years, P = 0.02). More patients with recurrent hypoglycemia reported impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (47 vs. 28%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS A significant proportion of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. Screening for impaired awareness is an important component of routine diabetes care and can identify patients at increased risk of a severe hypoglycemic event.

The 71-year-old took a tumble as he joined in a training session with school children at Twickenham Academy yesterday. His visit, with party leader Nick Clegg, comes ahead of perhaps the biggest year yet for British rugby with the arrival of the World Cup. Scroll down for video. The Business Secretary crashes to the turf during a school rugby training session at Twickenham Academy. Undeterred, the MP for Twickenham played on in a pair of corduroy trousers and smart black shoes. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg, gripping a Gilbert rugby ball, plots his line of attack. Under pressure: Dressed in a pair of chinos and black astroturf shoes, Mr Clegg tries to grasp the ball. Mr Clegg finds his path blocked as he tries to launch an attack during the session at Twickenham Academy. No way through: Mr Clegg tries to steer a pass through a crowded passage of budding rugby players. Marching on: The Lib Dem leader strides through a gap in the defence, casually carrying the ball in one hand. A confident Mr Clegg, dressed in a tracksuit with an English rose, trots along with the ball in his hand. Mr Cable, Lib Dem Business Secretary and MP for Twickenham, was unhurt in the fall and laughed it off with the young players. The MP for Twickenham later tweeted: 'Great fun seeing @EnglandRugby outreach work in Twickenham getting young people involved in rugby ahead of World Cup'. The visit came as the England rugby team are due to face Wales in the Six Nations on Friday. The Lib Dems are also celebrating the 2015 Rugby World Cup which will start in September and be hosted across 11 cities and 13 venues - from Brighton to Newcastle. The party says the global event will support 12,000 jobs, add £2.2 billion to the UK economy, and create a lasting legacy. Mr Clegg - who left the pitch unscathed - said: 'We all remember the incredible success of the 2012 Olympics and the 2014 Grand Départ of the Tour de France in Yorkshire. They both left a legacy that the whole country can be proud of. 'This year, we have the privilege of hosting the Rugby World Cup and it promises to the biggest ever for English rugby. 'Not only will it bring billions of pounds to our economy and create thousands of jobs but it will leave a lasting legacy, building on the work here at the Twickenham Academy, inspiring youngsters from every background to pick up a ball.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Il Mare Context: The story begins with Eun-joo moving out of a house by the sea called \\"Il Mare\\". As she is leaving, she leaves a Christmas card in the mailbox, asking the next resident to please forward her mail to her. Sung-hyun, an architectural student, receives her card, but is puzzled, since he is the first resident at \\"Il Mare\\" and the card is dated 2 years in the future. After a series of back and forth correspondences, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun realize they are living 2 years apart, Eun-joo in the year 2000 and Sung-hyun in the year 1998. After some testing, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun discover that the mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\" is enabling their communication and they can pass objects and living creatures through.Utilizing the mailbox, Eun-joo asks Sung-hyun to retrieve a tape player she lost two years ago, which he gets for her. After his father, a noted architect, falls ill, Sung-hyun asks Eun-joo to obtain a book about his father, which she does. However, she succumbs to a minor traffic accident and while hospitalised, the book fails to reach Sung-hyun in time before his father's death. After reading the book, he finally accepts his father's love for him and takes up his architectural work once more.As both Eun-joo and Sung-hyun continue their correspondence, they decide to try a date together, with each person participating in his or her own time. Eun-joo \\"takes\\" Sung-hyun to an amusement park, where he follows her instructions on how to have a good time at the park.

However, when Eun-joo goes to the beach, Sung-hyun doesn't show. She does see a house being built on the beach for an unknown architect's lover. When Eun-joo tells Sung-hyun that he didn't come, he is baffled about why he didn't... Answer:","response":"At the mailbox in the movie titled \\"Il Mare,\\" a seemingly magical phenomenon allows two individuals, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun, to communicate through time. Eun-joo is living in the year 2000, while Sung-hyun is in the year 1998, creating a two-year time difference between them. The mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\" enables them to send and receive letters, as well as objects and living creatures, across the time gap. Through this extraordinary method of communication, they form a unique bond and help each other in various incidents and difficulties. For instance, Eun-joo asks Sung-hyun to find a lost tape player, and he retrieves it for her, while he requests her help in obtaining a book about his ailing father, an esteemed architect. Unfortunately, Eun-joo's attempt to deliver the book is thwarted by a minor traffic accident, and the book doesn't reach Sung-hyun before his father passes away. Despite this setback, they continue to exchange letters via the mailbox and even create a shared experience across the time gap by going on 'dates.' However, they ultimately yearn to meet in person. They plan a real-life meeting at the beach where Eun-joo dreams of building a house, two years into Sung-hyun's future, meaning Eun-joo has to wait until he catches up with her in time. When the day of the meeting arrives, Eun-joo goes to the beach, but Sung-hyun is nowhere to be found. She sees a house being constructed on the beach, seemingly designed by an architect for his lover. Disappointed and confused as to why Sung-hyun didn't show up, Eun-joo informs him of what happened when she returned to her time. They are both baffled by the circumstances, leaving an air of mystery regarding what prevented Sung-hyun from appearing at the beach as planned. In summary, the mailbox at \\"Il Mare\\" serves as a conduit for communication and connection between two individuals living two years apart. The entwining of Eun-joo's and Sung-hyun's lives, facilitated by the mailbox, forms the central plot of the movie and leads to various emotional encounters, discoveries, and shared experiences. While they are able to create a bond across time, they are faced with the challenge of bridging the gap to meet in person, resulting in a poignant and thought-provoking narrative."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Let's solve the math problem step by step. First, we have two numbers that we need to subtract: -527231 - 139809. When you subtract a positive number from a negative number, you actually add the absolute value of the positive number to the negative number. So, let's find the sum: -527231 + 139809 = -387422 Now the equation looks like this: -387422 = 3468*p - 15596*p Now, let's combine the 'p' terms on the right side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 15596*p from 3468*p: 3468*p - 15596*p = -12128*p So now, our equation looks like this: -387422 = -12128*p Now, we need to find the value of 'p'. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -12128: -387422 / -12128 = -12128*p / -12128 This will give us: p = 31.958 (approximately) So, the value of 'p' is around 31.958.

In this detailed description, we will take a closer look at the various aspects of the data and delve deeper into the background and cultural significance of Ayam Penyet. Ayam Penyet is a traditional Indonesian and Malaysian dish that has its roots in Java, an island in Indonesia which is known for its rich history and diverse culture. The island of Java is renowned for its indigenous cuisine that has been passed down through generations, and Ayam Penyet is a prime example of its culinary heritage. The dish's name \\"Ayam Penyet\\" translates to \\"smashed chicken\\" in English, which accurately reflects the cooking technique used to prepare it. The chicken is first marinated in a flavorful and fragrant blend of herbs and spices, and then deep-fried until golden and crispy. The cooked chicken is then crushed or \\"smashed\\" using a mortar and pestle, making it tender and releasing the flavorful juices, which are in turn absorbed by the accompanying rice. The Banyumasan people, an ethnic group originating from the Banyumas Regency in Central Java, are closely associated with the dish. They are known for their rich cultural heritage, which includes not only their cuisine but also traditional music, dance, and customs. The Banyumasan people are proud of their regional identity and have played a significant role in the dissemination of Ayam Penyet throughout the Indonesian and Malaysian culinary landscape. Over the years, Ayam Penyet has gained popularity both within the region and internationally. As a testament to its widespread appeal, the dish can now be found in various restaurants across Indonesia and Malaysia. In Malaysian cuisine, where the dish has been warmly embraced, it is typically served with steamed rice and accompanied by a tangy, spicy sambal sauce, which adds a burst of flavor and heat to the succulent chicken. A generous portion of fresh vegetables, such as cucumber and lettuce, is also added to the plate, giving the dish a refreshing, palate-cleansing element. In Java, where the dish has its roots, Ayam Penyet is prepared and enjoyed in a similar manner. The dish is typically served on a banana leaf, which adds a hint of natural fragrance and adds to the overall sensory experience of enjoying the meal. Java's diverse culinary traditions employ a wide range of herbs and spices, and Ayam penyet showcases some of these distinct flavors. In conclusion, Ayam Penyet is a cherished dish hailing from the Java region in Indonesia and is closely associated with the Banyumasan people. The dish's unique preparation technique and vibrant flavors have contributed to its popularity in neighboring Malaysia and beyond. This data underscores the cultural and culinary significance of Ayam Penyet, as it celebrates the unique cuisine and rich heritage of the Banyumasan people and the broader Java region."},{"question":"Question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Ma is now a Junior Three student at Yuwang Middle School in Tongxin. Before this, she had to leave school twice. When she had to stop going to school the first time, her mum told her there was no money for her to go to school. She worked for 21 days and saved 13 yuan. With this money, she went back to school. The second time, her family told her she had to leave school but her two brothers could stay. \\"I want to study,\\" Ma wrote in her diary. \\"Why can boys study but girls can't? It would be wonderful if I could stay at school forever.\\" Ma loves school so much because she wants to have a better life. \\"My parents work hard in the fields but they are still poor. They have no knowledge. Most girls in my village leave school early and get married young. I don't want that kind of life,\\" Ma said. After her story became known, many French student sent money to her. Ma's dream is the same as ever. She hopes to go to Tsinghua University and become a reporter. \\"Then , I can find poor kids like me and help them, \\" she said.

Question: What was the first aircraft to use the ski jump ramp? Context: Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea. A:","response":"Harrier"},{"question":"By. Jonathan O'Callaghan. Parts of the primordial soup in which life arose have been maintained in our cells today according to scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA). Research published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry reveals how cells in plants, yeast and very likely also in animals still perform ancient reactions. These were thought to have been responsible for the origin of life some 4 billion years ago. Scientists at the University of East Anglia say our cells have an ancient ability to perform reactions similar to the origin of life 4 billion years ago (illustrated). The primordial soup theory suggests life began in a pond or ocean. Mitochondria (illustrated) continue to perform similar actions today. Every living thing on Earth depends on a mysterious tangle of molecules called ribosomes. These are the cell’s protein factories, translating the genetic information in DNA into an amino acid sequence to create proteins. Scientists believe that the ribosome - whose history is difficult to track - holds clues to how the first molecules of life came together around four billion years ago. Now researchers are a step closer to uncovering these clues after modelling the evolution of these biological factories in unprecedented detail. The core of the ribosome is essentially the same in all living systems, while the outer regions expand and become complicated as species gain complexity. By digitally peeling back the layers of modern ribosomes, scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta were able to model the structures of the very first of these biological factories. 'The history of the ribosome tells us about the origin of life,' said Loren Williams, a professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The study compared three-dimensional structures of ribosomes from a variety of species of varying biological complexity, including humans, yeast, bacteria and archaea. The researchers found distinct fingerprints in the ribosomes where new structures were added to the ribosomal surface without altering the core. The research team then worked the process backwards in time to generate models of simple, primordial ribosomes. The primordial soup theory suggests that life began in a pond or ocean as a result of the combination of metals, gases from the atmosphere and some form of energy, such as a lightning strike, to make the building blocks of proteins which would then evolve into all species. The new research shows how small pockets of a cell - known as mitochondria - continue to perform similar reactions in our bodies today. These reactions involve iron, sulfur and electro-chemistry and are still important for functions such as respiration in animals and photosynthesis in plants. 'Cells confine certain bits of dangerous chemistry to specific compartments of the cell,' said Lead researcher Dr Janneke Balk, from the UEA’s school of Biological Sciences and the John Innes Centre (JIC). 'For example small pockets of a cell called mitochondria deal with electrochemistry and also with toxic sulfur metabolism. 'These are very ancient reactions thought to have been important for the origin of life. 'Our research has shown that a toxic sulfur compound is being exported by a mitochondrial transport protein to other parts of the cell. 'We need sulfur for making iron-sulfur catalysts, again a very ancient chemical process. 'The work shows that parts of the primordial soup in which life arose has been maintained in our cells today, and is in fact harnessed to maintain important biological reactions.' The research was carried out at UEA and JIC in collaboration with Dr Hendrik van Veen at the University of Cambridge. It was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. This image from the researchers shows a normal plant (left) and a plant that cannot export sulfur from the mitochondria anymore (right, looking very small and yellow), while at the same time an ancient enzyme required. to detoxify sulfur inside mitochondria is also inactivated, suggesting the cells retain an ancient ability. Write highlights for this article.","response":"1. Researchers at the University of East Anglia have found that cells in plants, yeast, and possibly animals still perform ancient reactions that were part of the primordial soup from which life originated around 4 billion years ago. 2. The study reveals that the ribosome, the cell's protein factory, holds key information about the origin of life and its early evolution. 3. The researchers discovered that mitochondria in cells perform reactions involving iron, sulfur, and electrochemistry that were crucial to the formation of early life. 4.

It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through.

Bimala Prasad was born in 1874 in Puri (Orissa) a son of Kedarnath Datta Bhaktivinoda Thakur, a recognised Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava philosopher and teacher. Bimala Prasad received both Western and traditional Indian education and gradually established himself as a leading intellectual among the bhadralok (Western-educated and often Hindu Bengali residents of colonial Calcutta), earning the title Siddhanta Sarasvati (\\"the pinnacle of wisdom\\"). Under the direction of his father and spiritual preceptor, Bimala Prasad took initiation (diksha) into Gaudiya Vaishnavism from the Vaishnava ascetic Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji, receiving the name Shri Varshabhanavi-devi-dayita Dasa (Sri Varsabhanavi-devi-dayita Dasa, \\"servant of Krishna, the beloved of Radha\\"), and dedicated himself to arduous ascetic discipline, recitation of the Hare Krishna mantra on beads (japa), and study of classical Vaishnava literature. The encounter with and initiation from Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji, an illiterate yet highly respected personality, had a transformational effect on Siddhanta Sarasvati. Later, reflecting on his first meeting with the guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati recalled: It was by providential dispensation that I was able fully to understand the language and practical side of devotion after I had met the practicing master [Gaura Kishora Das Babaji]....No education could have prepared me for the good fortune of understanding my master's attitude....Before I met him my impression was that the writings of the devotional school could not be fully realised in a practical life in this world. My study of my master, and then the study of the books, along with the explanations by Thakura Bhaktivinoda [Bhaktisiddhanta's father Kedarnatha Datta], gave me ample facility to advance toward true spiritual life. Before I met my master, I had not written anything about real religion. Up to that time, my idea of religion was confined to books and to a strict ethical life, but that sort of life was found imperfect unless I came in touch with the practical side of things. After receiving initiation, Siddhanta Sarasvati went on a pilgrimage of India's holy places. He first stayed for a year in Jagannath Puri, and in 1904 travelled to South India, where he explored various branches of Hinduism, in particular the ancient and vibrant Vaishnava Shri and Madhva sampradayas, collecting materials for a new Vaishnava encyclopaedia. He finally settled in Mayapur 130 km north of Calcutta, where Bhaktivinoda had acquired a plot of land at the place at which, according to his research, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born in 1486. At that time, Bhaktivinoda added the prefix \\"bhakti\\" (meaning \\"devotion\\") to Siddhanta Sarasvati, acknowledging his proficiency in Vaishnava studies. Starting from 1905, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati began to deliver public discourses on the philosophy and practice of Chaitanya Vaishnavism, gathering a following of educated young Bengalis, some of whom became his students. While assisting Bhaktivinoda in his developing project in Mayapur, Bhaktisiddhanta vowed to recite one billion names of Radha (Hara) and Krishna - which took nearly ten years to complete - thus committing himself to the lifelong practice of meditation on the Hare Krishna mantra taught to him first by his father and then by his guru. The aural meditation on Krishna's names done either individually (japa) or collectively (kirtana) became a pivotal theme in Bhaktisiddhanta's teachings and personal practice.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did people view this?","response":"As an AI, I can't directly interpret people's views from the user's provided text as it does not contain any quotes or passages that explicitly express how people viewed Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and his actions.

Italy is home to a diverse, rich culture steeped in history, and the Italian language itself is a Romance language, originating from the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. Italian is primarily spoken by around 70 million speakers and is the official language of Italy, San Marino, and Vatican City. Italian, like the other Romance languages, descended from Vulgar Latin; it evolved over centuries in the context of Italy's many regional dialects. The establishment of a standardized Italian language is attributed to Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio, celebrated poets and writers who markedly influenced the Italian language and literary tradition. The first known documents written in proto-Italian dates to the early 10th century. Italian shares many similarities with its Romance language cousins, including Spanish, French, and Portuguese. These similarities range from their use of gendered nouns and extensive conjugations to a shared vocabulary base owing to their Latin roots. Italian is often viewed as the Romance language most closely related to Latin, both in terms of its lexicon and its grammatical structure. The Italian language's resounding presence in the arts and sciences has led to its status as not just a national language but also as a language with global significance. Its impact on our modern world can be seen in several aspects of culture, including music, visual arts, and cuisine.

Philip, an imposing man with a strong jaw and a noble air, crossed his arms over his chest and continued to stare disapprovingly at his old friend. \\"He may be your son, Richard, but you must not let your heart override your sense. To knight one so young is bound to cause dissent among your ranks. It will be seen as nepotism, as favoritism, and you may very well create resentment among those in your service.\\" Richard, the proud father and seasoned knight, frowned and refused to back down. He was a loyal and stern man, not prone to sentimentality. However, his love for his son and the tragedy of the boy's mother's death had both softened him and made him more determined to give his son the life and opportunities he deserved. \\"He has shown exceptional skill with blade and horse, Philip. I would not consider him if I did not believe he was worthy. And as for the concerns of my household, I am well equipped to handle them.\\" With a deep sigh, Philip reluctantly nodded and let the matter drop. He knew Richard was not a man to change his mind easily, but he had hoped he might at least make him reconsider the consequences to some extent. \\"Very well. You know my thoughts on the matter, but ultimately it is your decision.\\" Richard's eyes softened, grateful for his friend's understanding and support. He placed a hand on Philip's shoulder, a gesture that belied the weight of the gratitude he felt for the man who had been by his side for so many years. \\"Thank you, Philip. Your concern and counsel are invaluable to me.\\" Their conversation was interrupted by the introduction of the impressive destrier, a wondrous sight indeed. The magnificent beast was led into the courtyard by a stable boy, its powerful muscles rippling under its glossy coat as it snorted and tossed its head. Its finely tooled saddle and intricate armor spoke of the wealth and prestige of its owner. As the two men looked on, the young boy in question, Richard's son Edward, made his way toward the animal with a blend of excitement and reverence, his eyes wide with wonder. Despite his tender age, there was already a certain air of nobility about him, and it was easy to see that he would one day make an impressive knight. Edward approached the destrier carefully, extending a hand to let it become familiar with his scent. The horse, despite its size and strength, was well-trained and adept with inexperienced riders. Soon enough, the boy was leading it around the courtyard, delighting in its magnificence. Philip couldn't help but feel a pang of concern as he watched the scene unfold. He knew the dangers and challenges that lay ahead for young Edward should he become a knight, but he also couldn't deny the sense of pride in his chest at witnessing the young boy's obvious potential. He simply hoped his friend's decision wouldn't have grave consequences for all involved. The task of knighting Edward by next spring would not be easy. Many trials and lessons awaited the young squire, and there would be much debate among the nobles and knights as to his readiness for such a prestigious title. Richard's determination and the guidance of skilled mentors would have to see him through the whirlwind journey ahead. Yet despite the many obstacles that lay ahead, there was also a sense of optimism in the air. For as Philip and Richard looked upon the young Edward and his new destrier, they couldn't help but feel a surge of hope and confidence in the future – a testament to the power of youth, ambition, and the unwavering bonds of loyalty and friendship that connected them all."},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986. Initially I didn't' think I would make it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so obnoxious, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to watch him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If that wasn't bad enough, once the small American town's finest workers were shown the image only got worse. On the opposite spectrum the Japanese were presented as emotionless, robotic workaholics. The movie wasn't even all that funny, I only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it. And I'm glad I continued the watch. Just like boxing, judges are swayed by how you finish the round. This movie went from about a three up to the seven I rated it because of the ending. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending and this was just that. It was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory, but what was most special was the marriage between the Japanese customs and values and the American customs and values.

The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Sign up for our newsletter and other special offers: sign me up Thank you for signing up! Liz Krainman and 4-month-old Sammy are your typical happy, healthy mother and daughter. Strangers stop to ask, \\"How old?\\" and comment on how much Sammy looks like her mom.They'd never guess the extraordinary journey it took to bring Sammy into the world.Krainman, 33, has severe diminished ovarian reserve, a condition that leaves her unable to have genetic children. So she and her husband Kevin, 37, turned to the little-known option of embryo adoption to start their family.And Sammy? In 2006, 1,700 miles away from the Krainmans' Austin, Texas, home, she was just a newly fertilized, 6-day-old embryo – the product of another couple's IVF cycle – put on ice in a storage facility. Seven years later, that very embryo would be thawed and transferred into Krainman's uterus. Nine months after that, Sammy was born.Follow all that? It's a mind-boggling process, even for the new mom herself.\\"I can't even begin to tell you how boggled my mind is,\\" she says. \\"I can't even wrap my head around it.\\"In the IVF world, unused embryos are typically discarded or donated to science, but a third option exists and is slowly gaining popularity: embryo adoption.Krainman found two donors, Vicky Rauchle and Libby Kranz, on the Internet.First, she found Rauchle on Miracles Waiting , an embryo donation site, and she found Kranz through a traditional adoption forum online. Krainman underwent three attempts at pregnancy with the donated embryos. The first two attempts ended in early miscarriages.On her third attempt, one embryo from each donor was transferred into her uterus, and she maintained a healthy pregnancy. But until her child was born, she would not know which \\"batch\\" the baby came from.Here, in her own words, Krainman and her husband tell PEOPLE exclusively about her unique road to motherhood.I had always been open to traditional adoption, but when I learned embryo adoption existed, something just clicked and felt right for us. I wanted to experience pregnancy. I wanted to offer love to a child who needed it. I wanted to experience birth. Embryo adoption seemed like such an interesting and unexplored path to parenthood, and it seemed like an amazing and exciting thing to be a part of.I believe life begins at conception. Therefore, these embryos are life. They deserve an opportunity to grow and live and be loved just as any child deserves. These are little humans who happen to be nine months younger. And secondly, while those who have not struggled with infertility may think traditional adoption is easy, it's not. This notion that \\"just adopting\\" is as simple as going to the corner baby store to pick up one of thousands of unwanted babies is simply untrue. There are families on long waiting lists for newborns in the U.S., and many times international adoption is riddled with bureaucracy, extraordinary expense, fraud, etc. Sadly, there are no guarantees on any path to parenthood. It's just about choosing what is right for your own family.KEVIN: I knew very little of embryo adoption in the early days of our infertility. The ironic thing is that we actually said that if we had any remaining embryos from previous IVF cycles of our own, that we would want to donate them to a loving couple unsuccessful in IVF. Little did we know that we were going to be that family. In the end, we matched up with two incredible, selfless and amazing families. Unlike traditional adoption, my wife would experience pregnancy. I would feel my baby kick, go on late night ice cream runs and watch my wife give birth to our child.LIZ: Before infertility, we started with the mind-set of, \\"We will be able to have kids whenever we want to.\\" Then: \\"Maybe it will take more time than we thought.\\" Then: \\"We might need IVF, but at least that will be the answer.\\" And finally: \\"IVF won't even work for us.\\" Each step takes acceptance. And coming to terms with having a child who is not genetically related to us was no different. But as with most things in life, everything was meant to happen the way it did so we could have this little girl we have today. We wouldn't change a thing.I'd always thought in the back of my mind that if I couldn't have children, I'd adopt. I always felt that family wasn't about genetics, it's about love. When the reality came true for me that I couldn't have genetic children, I had to grieve the imagined moments when I'd let my husband feel those first kicks or when I'd wake him up in the middle of the night to go to the hospital. That was a hard pill to swallow. When I learned that I could both adopt and experience pregnancy, I can't even describe the overwhelming feeling I had.Being pregnant with this miracle has made everything so much sweeter. I'd lie in silence in the mornings and feel the baby move and would feel overwhelming gratitude and joy. I know that this way of building a family may not be for everyone. But to me, every single aspect of pregnancy, the good and the bad, was not taken for granted because I had faced the reality that it might never have happened at all.In our embryo adoption community, we sometimes lovingly call our frozen embryos snowflakes. It fits them perfectly! Each is a tiny, delicate, frozen being, and no two are exactly alike. They are God's gift from heaven! Even though Sammy is no longer frozen, she is always going to be my Sammy Snowflake.It isn't nearly as expensive as one might think. It's usually much less than a typical IVF cycle. With IVF, you are creating embryos from scratch and it's much more involved, therefore expensive.In general, it costs 3,500 to 12,000 per attempt. For us, it cost between 6,000 and 7,000 per attempt and we had partial insurance coverage. Some clinics will do the whole process anonymously for closer to the 3,500 point. We did it all on our own. Donors typically ask for reimbursement for the storage, so that's one cost, plus the medical cost for the transfer, shipping costs to get the embryos sent, and a contract between the parties. You don't actually pay for the embryo itself – it's illegal. [Editor's note: Technically speaking, an embryo adoption is a transfer of property, rather than a traditional adoption, which makes the contract a relatively simple one, stating that the genetic parents have no rights to any resulting children.]I very much disagree with this. I have a firm belief in God and know He always has a hand in this process. Man may put the pieces of science together to form an embryo and to freeze it, but God puts the life and soul into these babies, just as He does any other baby. If man were in charge, it would work every time. I think it's incredibly arrogant to think that we actually create the life itself. We perform the miracles of science. God performs the miracle of life.I strongly believe that this is not immoral or inappropriate. It is beautiful and the answer to prayers for both donor families and recipients who feel these embryos deserve a chance.This was one of my main concerns when we first started thinking about embryo adoption. I did a lot of research and felt that open adoption would be right for us. I wanted our future child to have the option to know the family where she came from, and ideally have open communication with them. We talked to a psychologist who specialized in children born of donor gametes. One thing she reinforced for us is that these children deserve to know they came from embryo adoption and there shouldn't be a time they didn't know. We have decided we always want her beautiful story to be her \\"normal.\\"We decided to capture her story in a personalized book we will read to her. We will describe her as a baby seed. Something like: All families need baby seeds to have babies, but sometimes a mom and dad need help. A nice family with baby seeds gave us theirs to help us grow you in my tummy. We will further illustrate this with growing a garden and have regular discussions around it. As Sammy gets older, we will openly answer questions about it. We don't want it to be a secret. Secrets imply shame and her origins are anything but shameful. It took the love of so many people to bring her into this world and it's something to be celebrated.We love them as though they are our extended family and couldn't be more proud of where Sammy came from. No one could have predicted that Sammy's genetic family would endure the tragic loss of their eldest daughter, Jennifer, during my pregnancy with Sammy. But Libby and Tony have been incredible in not only making this possible for us, but in giving us their support and love despite their family tragedy. We are grateful to them beyond words. I get teary-eyed thinking about my gratitude – it's a level I never even knew was possible.KEVIN: The only real concern I had was that I thought I may feel like our child was \\"on loan\\" from our donor family. Would this child truly be our own? I think this is a fairly normal feeling for any parent-to-be who goes through either the traditional or embryo adoption route. You quickly realize that this is just not the case. Throughout Liz's pregnancy, genetics played less and less of a role in my mind. This baby growing inside of her now had a heartbeat that was being sustained by my wife. What she ate, what she did.When the morning came to meet our little girl I was both nervous and on top of the world. I knew that from that day forward our lives would never be the same. Then I saw my precious Sammy for the first time. Saying that the birth of a child is the happiest day in a person's life doesn't even come close. At that moment, all the years of sadness, hopelessness and loss vanished in an instant and when I heard my daughter's first cries I followed suit. The only word that can describe that moment is \\"sacred.\\" This was the little girl that we were supposed to have and whom we had been waiting for our entire lives.I think that many times couples who have leftover embryos don't wish to donate them to science or destroy them, yet they don't even know this third option exists! Not every embryo will result in a living, breathing child. Sadly, many of them do not. But it's important to both the donating families and the recipient families they are given this chance. For the people who struggle to build their family but cannot, I would like them to know this option exists too.Infertility and loss has produced some of the harshest pain I have ever known. And the saddest part to me is that there is a huge community of those who suffer in silence. I want others to not only know that they are not alone, but that there is another family-building option they may not be aware of. I hope that others can find success and joy in it just as we have. Even if I make a difference for just one person, it's all worth it.For more information on embryo adoption, readers can visit Krainman's blog, Wishing on a Snowflake , and EDA Community ||||| Photo I doubt if anyone having trouble conceiving wakes up thinking: What about adopting an embryo? In the crushing world of infertility, that seems like an even more distant option. The fertility clinic in Seattle told me we only qualified to be a part of its embryo-donation program because we had been such “failures” in trying to conceive. For the first time in our four-year battle with infertility, I was happy to admit our shortcomings. My husband, Noah, and I started trying to make a baby in 2010, just after I turned 30. We tried the old-fashioned way, with the help of ovulation test strips, a basal body thermometer and the advice from my doctor to “just relax.” We moved on to Clomid, the fertility gateway drug, and in the spring of 2012 we finally resorted to a reproductive endocrinologist. Thus began our rapid descent into the abyss of assisted reproductive technology. When we started trying to create our family, we didn’t know that it would involve many other people and tens of thousands of dollars. We didn’t know I could be almost out of eggs in my early 30s. We didn’t know that we would spend years injecting hormones into my body in the hope of finding that elusive one good egg. We didn’t know we could have our hearts broken repeatedly by losing something that never was. And we didn’t know that we would have to rethink our goals when it came to creating our family. We no longer limited our quest to passing on our genetic material; we just wanted to be parents. However we could. After several intrauterine inseminations and one round of IVF, involving days of meticulous medicated preparation, we began researching traditional adoption when my younger sister offered to donate her eggs. Although our trusted doctor was slightly hesitant to use the eggs of a 29-year-old who shared my genes, my husband and I thought this was a good option. We could have a genetically related child, and I could bond by carrying it to term in my own body. That was the summer of 2013, the summer I learned the meaning of true love and generosity as my sister moved home to prepare for her contribution. With her help we got to our first transfer day, but our doctor was right; a donor related to me was not the best choice. The transfers resulted in what the infertility community refers to as BFNs (Big Fat Negatives). It took a while to come back from that defeat — emotionally, physically and financially. We couldn’t afford an anonymous egg donor, which can cost upward of 30,000. And we couldn’t afford to start the process of traditional adoption, which would cost about the same. But moments of utter despair are often redeemed by some unexpected option arising from the rubble. One morning late last year, in frantic desperation, I started calling all the fertility clinics I knew that might have preserved embryos donated by couples who no longer needed them. After much research, I found our match in another state one thousand miles from us: a pair of embryos with my ethnic mix that had been frozen in 2010. Something just felt right. Noah and I no longer cared about our genetics. We cared only about having a family, being parents, and getting out of the tortuous lifestyle of struggling with infertility. This little baby popsicle seemed like our best choice. At a cost of just over 7,000 (not including medication), we did a frozen embryo transfer this past July and after four years and nearly 50,000, I’m finally pregnant with our “adopted” child. Noah and I have learned some valuable lessons during our parental pursuit. We have learned that families are created in many different ways. We have learned how to be patient and resilient and flexible, and how to band together in determination to make tough decisions for the betterment of our family. Essentially, we’ve learned how to be parents. We hope. ||||| When Stephanie and Ben Hawkins found out that they could not have biological children, they decided to adopt. But unlike many other couples, the Hawkinses, who live in western New York state, adopted their daughter Annika before she was born, in a process called embryo adoption. Embryo adoption, also known by the more formal term of embryo donation, allows people to legally adopt unused embryos that are left over from someone else's in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure. The embryos are then transferred to the adopting mother's uterus so that she can carry and give birth to the child. info Close Hawkins Family \\"People sometimes have that question when you have adopted a child -- whether through embryo adoption or some other form of adoption -- 'Do you feel differently about that child?' And the answer is 'no,'\\" Stephanie Hawkins told CBS News. \\"That's your child. She is my daughter.\\" Annika's arrival in 2009 came about as a result of modern medical technology and some of its unintended consequences. When a couple undergoes in vitro fertilization and is left with more embryos than they need, they are given three options: either to have the remaining embryos destroyed, donate them to science, or donate them to another couple that will adopt them in a process that is legally similar to the traditional adoption of a child that's already born. For prospective parents, the process has the added benefit of being less costly than alternatives like fertility treatments or a traditional infant adoption. When Gina Yasuda, the Hawaii-based embryo donor for the Hawkins family, decided to donate her three extra embryos in 2002, she was driven by her beliefs. \\"Because of my Christian faith, I knew I couldn't trash them or donate them to science,\\" she told CBS News. While she felt good about her decision, some of her relatives found it controversial. \\"I have family members and friends that question me: \\"How could you do that? That's your child',\\" she said. But she still chose to go through with it. Yasuda's doctors told her about Nightlight Christian Adoptions' Snowflakes Embryo Adoption program, which has coordinated more than 500 embryo adoptions since 1997. The resulting children are sometimes referred to as snowflake babies. Yasuda and her husband contacted the agency, created a profile, and then started reviewing profiles of families that applied to adopt her three embryos. When they came across Stephanie and Ben Hawkins' profile, they realized they'd found the right match. \\"We just saw their profile, and, to be honest with you, we really wanted to pick someone who was closer to Hawaii, but for some reason the Hawkins profile, it just grabbed me,\\" Yasuda said. \\"I don't know how to explain it, but everything about them felt right.\\" Shortly after that, the adoption program director emailed the Hawkins family and her message was \\"pretty ecstatic,\\" Stephanie said. \\"And she said 'You're not gonna believe this -- this family has been looking for three years for a family that they wanted to place embryos with and they think you're the one,'\\" Stephanie said. info Close Hawkins Family The donated embryos remain frozen until the adopting mother is ready for the embryo transfer. In the Hawkins' case, that day came in August 2008. The embryos are then thawed before getting transferred to the woman's body. About 50 percent of donated embryos typically survive being thawed, but, in the case of the Hawkins family, all three survived, Stephanie said. Her doctor advised that she get all three embryos transferred, as usually only one-third of them can survive in the uterus. \\"We could have had triplets,\\" Stephanie said. But the doctor eventually informed the couple that there was one baby growing in Stephanie's womb. Stephanie and Ben still remember the mixture of feelings they experienced when they got the news. \\"Of course we were excited that the pregnancy was continuing, but also it took us by surprise that we were also very sad that we had lost two babies,\\" Stephanie said. \\"They weren't alive anymore.\\" \\"You adopt these embryos, and you feel like you are adopting babies -- they are yours now. I knew that they were alive going into me,\\" she said. Stephanie's pregnancy went well, and, in May 2009, Annika was born. info Close Hawkins Family \\"As soon as she gave birth, Stephanie told Snowflake that she wanted to have direct contact so that was a blessing to me,\\" Yasuda said. Since then, the two families have been communicating with each other on a regular basis, exchanging emails with updates and photos. Moreover, when Annika was 2 years old, Yasuda and her family came to visit the Hawkins family to meet Annika in person. \\"It felt good and, most importantly, it felt right,\\" Yasuda said about the memorable visit. \\"Everybody is where they are supposed to be. Annika is where she is supposed to be. Those are her parents.\\" Annika is now 5 1/2 years old and her parents describe the joy she's brought into their lives. \\"She's a social butterfly,\\" and she enjoys being around people, Ben said. \\"She's very bubbly.\\" \\"She is very outgoing. She's not really afraid of anything,\\" Stephanie added. \\"We can't imagine not having done embryo adoption and not having her,\\" she said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"This story is about a woman named Liz and her baby Sammy.

Plot title: Zeder Movie plot: In 1956, Gabriella (Veronica Moriconi)âa girl with apparent psychic powersâis brought to the enormous house of Dr. Meyer (Cesare Barbetti) in Chartres, France. Meyer intends to conduct an experiment testing her abilities. He takes her into his basement, where the youngster abruptly falls to her knees and begins digging into the dirt. \\"This is where you're hiding, isn't it?\\" Meyer yells. He rushes upstairs for help from his assistants and leaves Gabriella by herself. She is attacked by something unseen and is taken to the hospital. In the basement, further digging reveals a rotted corpse, with a nearby wallet identifying the dead man as Paolo Zeder. Dr. Meyer realizes that the earth in which Zeder was buried was a 'K-Zone'. In present day Bologna, Stefano (Gabriele Lavia), a novelist, is given an old typewriter as a birthday present by his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas). One night, after Alessandra has gone to bed, he discovers a series of typed letters on the typewriter's ribbon. As he reads the ribbon, he finds it is an essay written by scientist Paolo Zeder discussing the existence of K-Zonesâareas where death ceases to exist. According to Zeder's essay, bodies buried in these zones can return from the dead. Stefano investigates the message left on the typewriter ribbon. He encounters people who make it clear that they do not appreciate any questions relating to Paolo Zeder or K-Zones. However, the resistance he experiences intrigues him even more. He becomes obsessed with getting answers to the mystery and temporarily abandons his wife. His investigation leads him to a huge old property, ostensibly abandoned but protected by electrified fences.

The Guardian's investigative scoop has been quickly followed by reports such as this in the London Evening Standard: \\"Families of the July 7 victims hit out today after it emerged that an al-Qaida 'supergrass' who set up a training camp attended by the mastermind of the London bombings has been freed after only four and a half years in prison. \\"Mohammed Junaid Babar, whose testimony helped secure the conviction of Islamists plotting to blow up the Bluewater shopping centre and Ministry of Sound nightclub, was released last December by the U.S. authorities in return for his 'exceptional co-operation.' \\" The Evening Standard adds that Clifford Tibber, a lawyer representing the families and survivors of the July 7, 2005, attacks, at the July 7 inquest, compared his clients' outrage with that expressed by relatives of those killed in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland when they learned that Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the only person convicted for that attack, had been released by Scottish authorities: \\"When the British government released Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber who received a life sentence, on compassionate grounds after eight years the Americans were furious. Imagine how the bereaved and the survivors will feel about [Babar's] paltry sentence,\\" Tibber said. As the Guardian reminds us, \\"52 people were killed and 784 injured on 7 July 2005 when four suicide bombers detonated rucksacks filled with explosives and nails on London's transport system in the morning rush hour.\\" ||||| Anger at release of 'supergrass' who helped train 7/7 attack leader Martin Bentham, Home Affairs Editor 14 Feb 2011 14 Feb 2011 Families of the July 7 victims hit out today after it emerged that an al Qaeda \\"supergrass\\" who set up a training camp attended by the mastermind of the London bombings has been freed after only four and a half years in prison. Mohammed Junaid Babar, whose testimony helped secure the conviction of Islamists plotting to blow up the Bluewater shopping centre and Ministry of Sound nightclub, was released last December by the US authorities in return for his \\"exceptional co-operation\\". The decision, disclosed in court documents today, came despite his conviction in 2004 for five terrorist offences for which he could have faced up to 70 years in jail. His defence lawyer said that Babar, who before his arrest had set up the training camp in Pakistan attended by 7/7 ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan, had paid his \\"debt to society\\" and had begun a new life with his wife and daughter. Graham Foulkes, whose 22-year-old son David was killed by Khan in the Edgware Road blast, today accused the US authorities of failing to ensure that justice was done. \\"People can get four and a half years for burglary. They can get more for some road traffic offences. So for an international terrorist who's directly linked to the death of my son and dozens and dozens of people to get that sentence is just outrageous,\\" he said. Clifford Tibber, a lawyer representing the victims' families and survivors at the July 7 inquest, also hit out. \\"When the British government released Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber who received a life sentence, on compassionate grounds after eight years the Americans were furious. Imagine how the bereaved and the survivors will feel about [Babar's] paltry sentence.\\" Babar was arrested in April 2004 after flying to the US a month earlier and within days began telling the authorities all he knew, pleading guilty to five offences. He admitted meeting a British extremist known as \\"Ibrahim\\" - who later turned out to be Khan- at Islamabad airport and taking him to the terrorist camp in 2003. But although he was shown a picture of Khan prior to the London attacks in 2005, it was only after them that he saw other photos and identified him as \\"Ibrahim\\". ||||| An American jihadist who set up the terrorist training camp where the leader of the 2005 London suicide bombers learned how to manufacture explosives, has been quietly released after serving only four and a half years of a possible 70-year sentence, a Guardian investigation has learned. The unreported sentencing of Mohammed Junaid Babar to \\"time served\\" because of what a New York judge described as \\"exceptional co-operation\\" that began even before his arrest has raised questions over whether Babar was a US informer at the time he was helping to train the ringleader of the 7 July tube and bus bombings. Lawyers representing the families of victims and survivors of the attacks have compared the lenient treatment of Babar to the controversial release of the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Babar was imprisoned in 2004 – although final sentencing was deferred – after pleading guilty in a New York court to five counts of terrorism. He set up the training camp in Pakistan where Mohammad Sidique Khan and several other British terrorists learned about bomb-making and how to use combat weapons. Babar admitted to being a dangerous terrorist who consorted with some of the highest-ranking members of al-Qaida, providing senior members with money and equipment, running weapons, and planning two attempts to assassinate the former president of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf. But in a deal with prosecutors for the US attorney's office, Babar agreed to plead guilty and become a government supergrass in return for a drastically reduced sentence. The Guardian has obtained a court document which shows that on 10 December last year – six years after his initial arrest and subsequent guilty plea – he was sentenced to \\"time served\\" and charged 500 (£310) by the court in a \\"special assessment\\" fee. The document also reveals that Babar had by then spent just over four years in some form of prison and more than two years free on bail. Graham Foulkes, a magistrate whose 22-year-old son David was killed by Khan at Edgware Road underground station in 2005, said: \\"People get four and a half years for burglary. They can get more for some road traffic offences. So for an international terrorist who's directly linked to the death of my son and dozens and dozens of people to get that sentence is just outrageous.\\" Fifty-two people were killed and 784 injured on 7 July 2005 when four suicide bombers detonated rucksacks filled with explosives and nails on London's transport system in the morning rush hour. The lawyer representing the families of the dead and survivors, Clifford Tibber of the law firm Anthony Gold, said they would be devastated to learn that Babar had served only a small proportion of his possible sentence. \\"Babar admitted setting up and funding training camps attended by the 7/7 bombers,\\" Tibber said. \\"When the British government released Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber who received a life sentence, on compassionate grounds after eight years the Americans were furious. Imagine how the bereaved and the survivors will feel about [Babar's] paltry sentence.\\" A remark from the sentencing judge that Babar \\"began co-operating even before his arrest\\", has raised the possibility, supported by other circumstantial evidence obtained by the Guardian, that he may have been an informant for the US government before his detention by the FBI in April 2004. Babar facilitated the London bombers' knowledge of bomb-making when he invited around a dozen British jihadists to attend a camp that he had helped set up in north-west Pakistan in the summer of 2003. In a debriefing with US law enforcement agents in 2004, Babar told US prosecutors about Khan, whom he knew as \\"Ibrahim\\". British terrorism investigators showed Babar an unclear surveillance photo of Khan in August 2004, but Babar failed to identify him. He has said that when he saw pictures of Khan in newspapers after the bombings he alerted the US authorities straight away: \\"I told them [the American authorities] that was the person that was Ibrahim. I had mentioned Ibrahim before July 2005.\\" After his guilty plea in 2004, Babar spent a good proportion of his four and a half years outside the regular prison system. He flew to testify in trials in the UK and in Canada and met law enforcement officers from around the world. In 2008 he was granted bail awaiting final sentencing, after being warned by a judge that his conviction on five terrorism offences carried a maximum 70-year term. Although a probation report dated 9 July 2010 recommended that Babar remain in jail for another 30 years, the US attorney's office submitted their own report to the New York court, known as a 5K1, which praised Babar's work. One extract read out in court stated: \\"Over the last six and a half years the level of assistance provided by Babar to both the United States government and foreign governments has been more than substantial. It has been extraordinary.\\" Speaking in court about Babar's role in helping to jail British, Canadian and American terrorists, the assistant US attorney Brendan McGuire described Babar's co-operation as exceptional, and he recommended that he be given a significantly reduced sentence. Babar's defence lawyer, Daniel Ollen, told the court that during the two years his client had been out on bail, he had \\"paid his debt to society\\" and had settled into a new life with his wife and daughter. Ollen said the government's positive statements on behalf of Babar in court spoke volumes about his \\"hugely successful\\" actions, and that in 30 years he had never seen a more positive 5K1 report from the government. Speaking for the first time about the case, Ollen told the Guardian that in court \\"the government went to bat for him. They used words like 'extraordinary' and 'unprecedented'. Babar's co-operation really was spectacular when you get down to it.\\" When sentencing Babar, the judge, Victor Marrero, praised his work, describing the sentence of four years and eight months as \\"reasonable and appropriate\\". \\"The court takes note that the government has evaluated Mr Babar's cooperation to be significant, truthful, complete, and liable.,\\" Marrero said. \\"[He] worked with the FBI and foreign governments to assist in investigations of terrorism organisations, including al-Qaida, and of terrorist activities such as the London bomb plot.\\" \\"Taking into account the nature and circumstances of the offence and the history and characteristics of the defendant ... the court finds that a sentence of time served is reasonable and appropriate and that such a term is sufficient but not greater than necessary to promote the proper objectives of sentencing,\\" Marrero said. A law enforcement agent who arrested Babar and spent more than 500 hours debriefing him said he believed Babar was selfish. The officer, who wished to be known as agent A, said: \\"Babar wasn't a hero. He didn't look at the American flag and suddenly become all patriotic. When his back was against the wall he did what was right for him ... he was selfish.\\" Further inquiries uncovered allegations from a top US terrorism lawyer who has reviewed sealed evidence in the case which suggests Babar could have been working for the US authorities before his arrest in April 2004. Having reviewed the court transcript himself, bereaved father Graham Foulkes said: \\"There's a hint from one or two of the sentences [in the transcript] that do strongly suggest [Babar's] co-operation was going well beyond his official arrest. And it looks as if the Americans may well have known in detail what Babar was up to in Pakistan [at the time] and that is a very, very serious matter.\\" When judge Marrero's office was asked to clarify the remarks, his office declined to comment. The US attorney's office declined to comment on whether Babar had been working with US agencies before his arrest. The law enforcement officer involved in Babar's arrest and debriefing also refused to discuss the allegations. Freed from prison and no longer in the witness protection scheme, it is not known where Babar is currently living. Visiting Babar's childhood home in the Jamaica area of Queens, New York, the Guardian was told that Babar's mother was on holiday in Pakistan. The woman who answered the door and identified herself as Babar's cousin did not know where Babar was living and refused to comment further. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Mohammed Junaid Babar, an American jihadist who set up a terrorist training camp in Pakistan where Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 2005 London suicide bombings, learned to manufacture explosives, was released from a U.S. prison after serving only four and a half years of a possible 70-year sentence due to his \\"exceptional cooperation\\" with authorities.

Movie title: Constantine Movie plot: John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with a gift or a curse to see demons and angels walking this earth disguised as humans. Demons and angels cannot make a person do anything, but they can whisper in your ear and give you an urge to do it. As a child, John could not understand what he was seeing, and he had enough of this life and wanted to leave this cruel world by killing himself. Unfortunately for John, he is saved from death, and now must atone for his act. John is given extraordinary powers, and becomes a guardian on earth. Whenever a demon breaks the rules, John exorcises them and sends them back to Hell. John is known by the police for working in the supernatural field of the occult, and Los Angeles police detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) wants his help in her investigation. Angela has discovered that spirits are walking the earth, and she believes they had some connection to the suicide of her twin sister. Angela becomes aware that John can see these spirits, and she wants to see them too. John reluctantly grants her wish. John and Angela must deal with representatives of both Heaven and Hell to save humanity. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)Set in Los Angeles, California, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a chain-smoking cynic, has the ability to see half-angels and half-demons true forms. He seeks salvation from eternal damnation to hell for a suicide attempt in his youth, by sending half-demons back to Hell with his sidekick Chas (Shia LaBeouf). However, full demons have begun attempting to cross over. Disturbed by this information and with his death looming over him due to lung cancer, Constantine seeks an audience with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton). Gabriel tells him that as he does his exorcisms to escape Hell and for his own benefit, they are vain acts that wont spare him. Departing, he encounters LAPD officer Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), investigating the death of her twin sister Isabel, who leapt from the roof of the mental hospital she was committed to.... The answer is:","response":"Constantine suspects that Isabel, Angela Dodson's twin sister, did not commit suicide but was rather targeted by demonic forces. As the plot develops, it is revealed that Isabel was a psychic with the ability to see the demons and angels, similar to John Constantine. Her psychic abilities made her a target for the demons, who sought to use her connection to this supernatural world for their own gain. Throughout the investigation, John Constantine and Angela Dodson work together to uncover the truth behind Isabel's death. John uses his unique abilities and knowledge of the occult to delve deeper into the escalating supernatural occurrences and determine their significance in relation to Isabel's untimely demise. Upon further exploration, they discover that the half-demon, Balthazar, killed Isabel as part of a larger plot to bring the son of the Devil, Mammon, into the human realm. Mammon has been seeking a powerful psychic, like Isabel, who can serve as a bridge between Hell and Earth, allowing him to cross over and wreak havoc on both worlds. In order to prevent Mammon's destructive arrival and a potential apocalypse, John and Angela must confront these demonic forces and foil their sinister plan. This includes battling the treacherous half-angel, Gabriel, who has turned against Heaven and is working with the demons in their efforts to bring about Earth's end. Ultimately, the movie reveals that Isabel's death was not a suicide but a tragic and coerced act orchestrated by the demons. With this knowledge, John Constantine and Angela Dodson work to avenge Isabel's death, protect humanity from the looming threat, and secure redemption for John's tormented soul. In conclusion, in the movie \\"Constantine,\\" John Constantine believes that Isabel was targeted and killed by demonic forces due to her psychic abilities, which played a crucial role in a larger diabolical plan to unleash Hell on Earth. Through their investigation and battles against supernatural entities, John and Angela unveil the truth behind Isabel's demise and work to prevent a catastrophic chain of events."},{"question":"If you wish to complain about DK Hostmasters decisions please contact the Complaints Board for the Domain Name Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","response":"If you wish to complain about DK Hostmaster's decisions, please contact the Complaints Board for the Domain Name."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. Question: How does Pres Trump feel about the tariffs?

From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings.

In his view, space only exists as a relation between objects and does not have an independent reality. This concept differs from Newton's idea of absolute space, where the frame of reference exists independently of the objects contained within it. Leibniz believed that motion also only exists as a relation between objects, which contrasts with Newton's concept of motion as something happening in relation to space itself. The debate between Leibniz's relational view of space and Newton's absolute space has been a significant topic in the history of philosophy and physics."},{"question":"Nous avons fait des progrès, mais certains membres de notre personnel doivent encore comprendre qu'ils sont responsables de l'application de la résolution 1325 (2000).

The construction worker showed more dedication for the roof than the wall, so the","response":"result was a meticulously crafted and stable rooftop that stood out amidst the rest of the structure, while the wall displayed certain imperfections and inconsistencies that reflected lesser attention and care. As the construction project progressed, it became evident that the construction worker's passion and expertise lay in creating and securing rooftops. The worker diligently spent numerous hours perfecting the measurements, selecting the most appropriate materials, consulting with roofing experts, and ensuring that the roofing was completed with impeccable attention to detail. The worker took the time to create an aesthetically pleasing design that not only complemented the building's overall architecture but also incorporated essential safety features. In fact, the construction worker took pride in this part of the project and continually aimed to exceed industry standards and the expectations of clients and colleagues. On the other hand, the construction worker seemed to possess a relative disinterest and lack of dedication towards constructing the wall. There were visible imperfections on it, such as uneven plasterwork, inconsistent brick placements, and poorly sealed gaps that could potentially lead to drafts and moisture penetration. Albeit not a complete disaster, it was noticeable that the worker did not employ the same level of expertise and concern for the overall quality and longevity of the wall as was displayed in the crafting of the rooftop. This disparity between the wall and the rooftop raised certain concerns amongst the project leaders, who felt that the construction worker's preferential dedication demonstrated an imbalance in the worker's skillset. After a series of meetings and evaluations, it was determined that the worker would benefit from additional training and mentorship, thus enabling them to become a more versatile and valuable member of the team. Upon completion of the training and guidance, the construction worker returned to the project with newfound enthusiasm and appreciation for constructing walls. While retaining their mastery for roofing works, the worker applied the same dedication and attention to detail in building the wall and addressing any previous shortcomings. As a result, the project’s final outcome displayed a consistent quality across all aspects, showcasing a harmonious synthesis of structural integrity, aesthetic appeal, and functional utility. In conclusion, the construction worker's initial dedication to the roof rather than the wall highlighted an opportunity for personal development and growth. Once recognized and addressed, both aspects of the building, the roof and the wall, ultimately benefited from the worker's newly acquired skills and dedication, ultimately resulting in a higher quality build that met the satisfaction of all parties involved."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: \\"When Your Lips Are So Close\\" made it on the \\"Billboard\\" Canada Country chart. \\"When Your Lips Are So Close\\" is a song recorded by Canadian country music artist Gord Bamford.

This weight of attack went on for two months, with the Luftwaffe dropping 13,900 short tons (12,600 t) of bombs. In November 1940, 6,000 sorties and 23 major attacks (more than 100 tons of bombs dropped) were flown. Two heavy (50 short tons (45 t) of bombs) attacks were also flown. In December, only 11 major and five heavy attacks were made.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: What was included in the attacks? Answer:","response":"The attacks included multiple elements as per the provided passage. First, there were bombings enacted by an impressive number of bomber planes. On one night alone, Birmingham was hit by 369 bombers from KG 54, KG 26, and KG 55. By the close of November, approximately 1,100 bombers were made available for night raids, with an average of 200 able to strike per night. The magnitude of these attacks, which spanned two months, can be credited to the heavy number of bombs dropped by the Luftwaffe. In this period, the Luftwaffe dropped a total of 13,900 short tons (equivalent to 12,600 metric tons) of bombs. Specifically, in November 1940, there were 23 major attacks, defined within the passage as cases where more than 100 tons of bombs were dropped. Also, in this month, there were 6,000 sorties (combat missions) flown and two heavy attacks, characterized by the dropping of 50 short tons (or 45 metric tons) of bombs. However, in December, the number of attacks lessened, amounting to only 11 major attacks and five heavy ones.

The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured. The vase was next restored by J. W. R. Axtell in 1948–1949, and then by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989. Answer:","response":"The first name of the person who was said to have \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\" is John.

Gertrude Chandler Warner, the original author of \\"The Boxcar Children\\" series, wrote and published a total of 19 books in the series between 1924 and her death in 1979. 2. Since Warner's death, other authors have been contracted by the publisher, Albert Whitman & Company, to continue the series, following the spirit and style of the original books. 3.

To determine the total number of books in \\"The Boxcar Children\\" series, we add the original 19 books written by Gertrude Chandler Warner to the 46 titles added by other authors in the years following her death. 19 (Warner's original titles) + 46 (additional titles by other authors) = 65 Answer: 65 books in total are in \\"The Boxcar Children\\" series, considering both Gertrude Chandler Warner's original books and the additions by other authors."},{"question":"Question: Is the following statement true? \\"The CEO of General Electric is George Orwell.\\" Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"No, the statement \\"The CEO of General Electric is George Orwell\\" is not true. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. George Orwell (born Eric Arthur Blair) was an English novelist, journalist, and critic, born on June 25, 1903, and died on January 21, 1950. He is most famous for his novels 1984 and Animal Farm. As a historical figure, George Orwell never held a position in a company like General Electric. 2. General Electric (GE) is an American multinational conglomerate that operates in various segments, including power, renewable energy, aviation, and healthcare. GE was founded by Thomas Edison, Elihu Thomson, and Charles Coffin in 1892. 3.

As of September 2021, the current CEO of General Electric is H. Lawrence Culp Jr., who started in the position on October 1, 2018.

Many banks say that their business is \\"untouched by human hands\\" and therefore safe. But they have no thought that the growing number of computer crimes show they can be used to steal. Computer criminals don't use guns. And even if they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there is often no proof. A computer cannot remember who used it. It simply does what it is told. The head teller at a New York City bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this because he moved the money from one account to another. Each time a customer whose money he had stolen questioned the balance in his account, the teller said it was a computer mistake, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught at last. Some workers use the computer's power to punish their bosses they consider unfair. Recently, a large company fired its computer record assistant for reasons that were connected with her personal life rather than her job. She was given thirty days notice. In those thirty days, she stole all the company's computerized records. Most computer criminals have been common workers. Now police wonder if this is \\"the tip of iceberg\\".

Five years on, a weekly 90-minute drive from their downtown apartment to the house has long been the norm. They enjoy gardening, barbecuing or simply relaxing in their getaway surrounded by mountains -- but often shrouded in Beijing's infamous smog. Yes, the couple's three-bedroom weekend home lies on the outskirts of the Chinese capital -- thousands of miles away from the original Jackson Hole valley in the U.S. state of Wyoming, which is known for its breathtaking natural beauty. The Chinese Jackson Hole is more crowded, containing some 1,000 single-family houses inspired by rustic lodges in the American frontier. Still, wealthy locals are lured to this sprawling development by the promise of living in the \\"Wild West.\\" After driving past security guards in cowboy outfits patrolling \\"Route 66\\" on golf carts, Liu's husband Lu Jun pulled over their SUV at the end of a cul-de-sac one recent Sunday. Opening the door to a world of Americana, Liu and Lu -- both lawyers in Beijing -- proudly displayed their fondness for the United States by adding personal touches to the built-in furniture and decoration that evoke the Old West. She studied and worked in Indianapolis for two years from 2003 to 2005, during which time he visited. Adorning the earthy-toned walls are colorful license plates from the U.S. states -- including Wyoming -- they have traveled to and a large framed copy of the American Declaration of Independence. \\"We want more freedom,\\" said Liu, 40, pointing to the framed copy she bought in Florida. \\"This is a milestone -- (we hang it here) partially for the history, partially for our profession.\\" \\"Many people have been to the United States and enjoy the environment there,\\" Lu, 55, added. \\"Those who haven't think this place is authentic America and they like it.\\" That's proven to be a great selling point for developer Liu Xiangyang since he -- with the help of an American designer -- launched the Jackson Hole project a decade ago. He has sold almost all the houses, and seen the property value double over the years with the bigger homes now fetching 1 million each. Official data shows that a typical urban resident in China earned less than 4,000 in 2012. Annie Liu -- who is not related to the developer -- and her husband feel pleased about their purchase as early believers, and bought a second, bigger house here last year. They say other homeowners share their appreciation for the American culture and values that are reflected in the architecture and setting, despite frequent news reports on rising tensions between the two nations. \\"We like the States and we like the lifestyle,\\" Liu said. \\"Let the governments worry about the things that should be worried about by them.\\" Her sentiment echoes the most recent results of an annual survey on Chinese people's attitude towards the United States by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Although the Pew study finds Chinese public perceptions of the United States becoming less favorable in 2012, it notes: \\"There is one constant: richer, younger, more educated, and urban Chinese all express a more positive view of (the soft power) aspects of America's image. And this also holds true for overall ratings of the U.S.\\" Developer Liu is a fan of the United States as well, overseeing construction for the next phase on his 70-square-kilometer lot -- the size of 13,000 American football fields. His plans include 2,000 townhouses mimicking the feel of Mendocino, a scenic coastal town in northern California, and a winery that he says will rival Napa Valley in ten years. In between sipping wine and chatting with residents at a lunch gathering on site, the 51-year-old businessman from the central Henan province reflects on his corporate mission. \\"For those who can afford to buy houses here, they have enough money,\\" he explained. \\"They want spiritual fulfillment.\\" For that, the developer has built a brand new church in the center of his town -- next to a row of small shops, bars and cafes -- serving residents like Annie Liu, who embraced Christianity as a graduate student in the United States. \\"This is an 'American' community so it's a necessary element here,\\" said Liu as she walked out of the soon-to-open Jackson Hole church. Although she misses the natural beauty and cultural diversity of the United States, Liu says she never hesitated about returning to the motherland because of her and her husband's career aspirations and their roots. Now comfortably settled at work and home back in China, where the Communist leadership is proclaiming national revival as the ultimate Chinese Dream, Liu feels she hasn't completely abandoned the American Dream -- as she and her fellow residents in this fictional U.S. town pursue their freedom and happiness every weekend.

To better understand their function and significance, it is important to examine each of these spacecraft categories in more detail. Satellites are artificial objects intentionally placed into orbit around Earth or other celestial bodies. Since the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957, satellites have been utilized for various purposes, such as communication, navigation, weather monitoring, and Earth observation. Satellite systems like GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo serve as global positioning and navigation providers, while weather satellites like NOAA and Meteosat help meteorologists to predict and monitor weather patterns. Satellites also contribute to a better understanding of Earth's resources and environmental conditions. Suborbital vehicles, on the other hand, are designed for short, high-altitude flights that do not require a full orbit around Earth. These spacecraft follow a ballistic parabolic trajectory, reaching altitudes above the Kármán line (100 km or 62 miles) – the point where Earth's atmosphere ends and outer space begins – before returning to the ground. Suborbital vehicles can be used for a variety of purposes, such as scientific research, astronaut training, and even space tourism. An example of a suborbital vehicle is Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, which aims to give tourists a taste of space travel without the need for a full orbital flight. Finally, spacecraft launch vehicles are specifically designed to transport and deploy satellites and other payloads into space. These vehicles have the crucial job of overcoming Earth's gravitational pull, allowing payloads to reach their intended orbits or positions in space. To achieve this, launch vehicles employ powerful rocket engines that generate thrust, lifting the vehicle and its payload off the ground and propelling them towards their destination. Launch vehicles vary in size and capabilities, but they are generally classified as expendable (single-use) or reusable (designed for multiple launches). Some renowned examples of spacecraft launch vehicles include SpaceX's Falcon 9 (reusable) and the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V (expendable). In conclusion, spacecraft such as satellites, suborbital vehicles, and spacecraft launch vehicles are essential tools that have revolutionized modern life, enabling communication, scientific research, and space exploration. As technology continues to advance, their significance is only set to increase as humanity endeavors to unlock further space-related achievements and discoveries."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: This task is to identify the language of a sentence correctly by classifying if it is English or Telugu Q: Summer : But the memory of you, I want one, too, that the leave.

Officials have already warned there is little chance of finding survivors. It is not certain how many people are trapped in the debris. The deadly mudslide hit the Meeriyabedda tea plantation near the town of Haldummulla, about 200km (120 miles) east of the capital Colombo, on Wednesday morning. Ministers told the Daily Mirror newspaper in Colombo that 150 people were trapped in the debris. The Island newspaper reported that as many as 250 people were buried alive. However Disaster Management Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told AFP after visiting the site on Wednesday that the total was closer to about 100 people. He said that most of those who were originally classified as missing were subsequently discovered to be at work or in school. Correspondents say that compiling a definitive figure has been made harder because an office where village records were maintained was destroyed in the landslide. Mr Amaraweera said that the area surrounding the tea plantation had also been made unstable by the recent heavy monsoon rains and that the recovery operation would have to proceed \\"cautiously\\". One witness told AFP that there was a noise like thunder when part of a mountainside crashed into the tea estate, burying some of the workers' homes in nine metres (30ft) of mud and debris. Mud covered many homes, leaving only their roofs visible. More than 300 survivors spent Wednesday night at two schools near the tea plantation. About 500 military personnel are said to be involved in the rescue operation. Local MP Udith Lokubandara told the BBC that many parents had returned home after leaving their children at school when the landslip happened. \\"It is a very sorry situation because there are many children who have become orphans,\\" he said. Sections of several national highways have been washed away by the rains, reports say. The Disaster Management Centre had issued warnings of more mudslides and falling rocks later this week. In June, monsoon rains triggered landslides in Sri Lanka that killed at least 22 people and forced thousands from their homes. Monsoon rains are caused by winds in the Indian Ocean and south Asia. They bring about wet and dry seasons in much of the region, and have a large impact on local ecosystems.

These types of heavy rains are called monsoon rains, and they happen in this part of the world a lot.

The Obama administration has been asking the Pakistanis for access to the women, who may possess important information about how bin Laden was able to live in his Abbottabad compound for an estimated five years. The three women and the bin Laden children have been in Pakistani custody since last Sunday. The White House has also requested that Pakistani authorities give US investigators access to some of the al Qaeda data that Navy SEALs left behind. -Jake Tapper ||||| After a bit of back of and forth, Pakistan has finally agreed to grant American officials access to Osama bin Laden’s three widows, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN on Tuesday. U.S. authorities will reportedly be given “direct access,” sources say, meaning that they’ll be available for interviews rather than just submitted questions. Malik didn't give a timeline for the talks. But what will the women reveal? The Daily Beast’s David A. Graham breaks down what we know about the various women who vowed to spend their lives with the world’s most wanted man. When Osama bin Laden was shot and killed, his matrimonial life came into quick focus as rumors circulated that he had used a wife as a human shield. That story was soon debunked, but the same young wife aroused even more interest when it emerged that she had been shot during the raid. And in a third twist, bin Laden’s companions have now become more than objects of popular fascination: they’ve come to be seen as potentially valuable intelligence assets. Osama bin Laden's fifth wife. Credit: Rehan Khan / Landov; AP Photo U.S. officials say they want to question the women about their late husband, his life in Pakistan, and who in the country might have known he was there. Amal Ahmed Abdulfattah, the wife who was injured in the raid, has reportedly already told Pakistani interrogators that the bin Laden clan lived in Abbottabad for five years and spent two and a half years before that in a tiny village not far away. But Pakistan isn’t allowing American officials access to them. In fact, it’s not even clear who the women are—but evidence suggests that they are Abdulfattah; Khairiah Sabar, also known as Umm Hamza; and Siham Sabar, also known as Umm Khaled. Information on the three women, as well as on bin Laden’s estranged wife, Najwa, and divorced former wife, Khadija, is minimal. Polygamy is not uncommon for well-off Saudi men, even ones of fewer means that bin Laden, says Madawi Al-Rasheed, an anthropologist at King’s College, London, who has written about Saudi society in Contesting the Saudi State. What’s more, the al Qaeda chief kept his views on marriage—both personal and theoretical—close to the vest, with little mention of them in his public statements, according to Bruce Lawrence, a professor at Duke University who edited Messages to the World, a collection of all of bin Laden’s utterances. In The Osama Bin Laden I Know, Peter Bergen quoted a college friend of bin Laden’s with whom he formed a view of marriage. Their fathers had practiced polygamy, and they intended to do so as well: the Prophet Muhammad had said that as many as four wives at a time were permissible, as long as none was neglected. Jamal Khalifa said bin Laden felt his father had erred in failing to give all his wives equal attention. “We look at polygamy as solving a social problem, especially when it’s confirmed that there are more women than men in the society,” Khalifa recalled. “It’s not fun, it’s not a matter of just having women with you to sleep with—it’s a solution for a problem. So that’s how [Osama and I] looked at it, and we decided to practice [polygamy] and to be a model.” In The Looming Tower, Lawrence Wright quoted bin Laden using a vivid analogy to describe how he dealt with his complicated domestic life: “One is okay, like walking. Two is like riding a bicycle: it’s fast but a little unstable. Three is a tricycle, stable but slow. And when we come to four, ah! This is the ideal. Now you can pass everyone!” “It’s like the sultan sitting there in his harem, although unfortunately for bin Laden, he did not have the luxury.” Each wife had her own apartment or house where the family lived as the family made repeated moves—leaving Saudi Arabia for Sudan in 1991, then transplanting itself to Afghanistan in 1996, and later moving around Afghanistan and Pakistan. Along the way, all but two of bin Laden’s wives apparently stayed with their husband all or some of the time, a rough-and-tumble path of deprivation and difficulty. What do we know about each of his wives? Here are short biographies. 1. Najwa Ghanem: Bin Laden first married when he was a teenager, wedding Najwa Ghanem, a Syrian cousin who was born in 1958, according to her memoir, Growing Up Bin Laden. They married in 1974. Speaking to Peter Bergen, her former sister-in-law Carmen bin Ladin described her as \\"meek, submissive, highly religious and constantly pregnant”—and indeed, she bore bin Laden 11 children. Although she was the “senior” wife, having married Osama first, she was younger than all his other wives until Amal. Lawrence Wright, in The Looming Tower, reported that she was an avid jogger and not well educated, but friendly and especially fond of decoration and aesthetics, keeping her house in Sudan beautifully appointed and seeking out Western cosmetics and lingerie. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Pakistan has agreed to grant U.S. authorities direct access to Osama bin Laden's three widows, potentially providing valuable intelligence assets.

Options: - cook - make tea - hurtful - friendly - hug Explain why a human would choose \\"friendly\\" to answer the question above:","response":"A human would choose \\"friendly\\" to answer the question above because when comforting a friend, the aim is to provide emotional support, understanding, and reassurance. Being friendly encompasses a variety of actions and behaviors that show kindness, warmth, and concern for the person's well-being. In this context, \\"friendly\\" represents an empathetic and supportive approach, making it the most appropriate option among the choices provided. Now, let's examine the other options: - Cook: Cooking for someone can be a thoughtful gesture, but it doesn't directly address the need for emotional support and comfort in times of distress. It may help to brighten their day but isn't specifically targeted at their emotional needs. - Make tea: Similar to cooking, making tea for someone can be a kind act, but it doesn't specifically focus on providing comfort and reassurance for emotional issues. It might be appreciated, but again it doesn't directly align with the purpose of comforting a friend. - Hurtful: This option is the opposite of what one would want to do when comforting a friend. Hurting someone, either emotionally or physically, would only add more pain and suffering to the situation instead of providing the support and solace they seek. - Hug: A hug can be a comforting and soothing gesture that demonstrates caring and empathy. However, as a standalone action, it might not fully address the complexity of the emotional support needed by the person. By choosing \\"friendly,\\" it encompasses a wider range of supportive behaviors, which could include hugging as well as offering words of encouragement, listening, or providing advice. In conclusion, the \\"friendly\\" option is the most suitable answer because it encompasses a variety of supportive and empathetic actions that one would use when comforting a friend in need. It focuses on both the emotional and psychological aspects of comfort and reassurance, rather than any single gesture or action."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A provincial park (or territorial park) is a park administered by one of the provinces of a country, as opposed to a national park.

Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California. - A park is an area of natural, semi-natural, or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park is a state park unit preserving the largest hydraulic mining site in California , United States . The mine pit and several Gold Rush - era buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Malakoff Diggins - North Bloomfield Historic District . The \`\` canyon '' is 7,000 feet ( 2,100 m ) long , as much as 3,000 feet ( 910 m ) wide , and nearly 600 feet ( 180 m ) deep in places . Visitors can see huge cliffs carved by mighty streams of water , results of the mining technique of washing away entire mountains of gravel to wash out the gold . The park is a 26 - mile ( 42 km ) drive north - east of Nevada City , California , in the Gold Rush country . The 3,143 - acre ( 1,272 ha ) park was established in 1965 . - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). - State or provincial parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use \\"state\\" or \\"province\\" as a political subdivision. State parks are typically established by a state to preserve a location on account of its natural beauty, historic interest, or recreational potential. There are state parks under the administration of the government of each U.S. state, and of some the Mexican states. The term is also used in the Australian state of Victoria. The Canadian equivalent term is provincial park. Similar systems of local government maintained parks exist in other countries, but the terminology varies. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Nevada City (originally, Ustumah, a Nisenan Maidu village; later, Nevada, Deer Creek Dry Diggins, and Caldwell's Upper Store) is the county seat of Nevada County, California, United States, located northeast of Sacramento and 28 miles north of Auburn. In 1900, 3,250 people lived in Nevada City; in 1910, 2,689 lived there; at the 2000 census, the population was 3,001, and at the 2010 census it was 3,068. - A sluice (from the Dutch \\"sluis\\") is a water channel controlled at its head by a gate. A mill race, leet, flume, penstock or lade is a sluice channelling water toward a water mill. The terms sluice, sluice gate, knife gate, and slide gate are used interchangeably in the water and wastewater control industry. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time. - Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particles. For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river water and on reaching the sea be deposited by sedimentation and if buried this may eventually become sandstone and siltstone, (sedimentary rocks). - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over . - A tax incentive is an aspect of a country's tax code designed to incentivize, or encourage a particular economic activity. - Mining is extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth usually from an orebody, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposits. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term \\"protected area\\" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas. - The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with 'nevada county'. Answer:","response":"Nevada City has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with Nevada County."},{"question":"Answer the question below: If Milo increases the heat he applies to a resistor, what happens to the resistance increases or decreases? Assuming that: The hotter a resistor becomes the more resistance it has. The answer to this question is:","response":"If Milo increases the heat he applies to a resistor, the resistance would increase. This is in line with your assumption that the hotter a resistor becomes, the more resistance it has. This principle is commonly interpreted as a resistor’s ability to resist the flow of electric current - this increases with temperature. The primary reason for this increase in resistance is the behaviour of atoms in the resistor. At higher temperatures, atoms vibrate more rapidly. This increased atomic activity can interfere with the flow of electrons (which constitutes the current), creating more collisions when electrons move through the resistor. The resistance is an outcome of these interactions. All these concepts fall under a phenomenon in physics called the \\"temperature coefficient of resistivity\\". This refers to the relative change in resistivity for each degree change in temperature. For most materials, the coefficient is positive, which means resistivity (and thus, resistance) increases as temperature goes up. The actual change in resistance can vary widely depending on the material of the resistor."},{"question":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Very nice and light camera app. Love it!\\" The answer is:","response":"★★★★★"},{"question":"I had chicken noodle , the rolls and a Vietnamese coffee .

(Press Association) Getting a special hotel room can make or break a trip, so here are five questions you should ask to be sure you get the best room possible â or maybe even an upgrade. The key is to get the front desk clerk involved in choosing the best room for you and not letting the hotel booking system choose it for you. You do that by making specific requests at the check in counter such as: Does this room have good wi-fi reception?Thankfully more and more hotels are offering in-room wi-fi for free. But in a world where you frequently “get what you pay for”, a free connection could also mean weak or spotty reception. Since wi-fi is broadcast via wireless routers located in hotel corridors, rooms closest to the routers get the best reception. Front desk staffers usually know which rooms get the most complaints about poor wi-fi reception, so they’ll actively search for a room they know gets a strong signal. Can I get a newly renovated room or one with a great view, a corner room, or a quiet room?Simply asking for any of the above gets the hotel clerk involved in choosing your room. Since these features don’t usually affect the room rate, by asking, you are likely to get the best room for the price. Is there an adjoining room?Noisy neighbours can distract you if you’re working, taking business calls or meeting with clients in your room. This is also an important request if you are a light sleeper. If peace and quiet is important to you, ask the clerk for a non-adjoining room (one without interior doors leading to an adjacent room). Does this room have a large, well-lit desk and chair?Some hotels have desks in every room that are suitable for working. Some don’t. By letting the clerk know that you plan to work in your room, you are more likely to get a larger or better room set aside for business travellers — maybe even one on a special club or concierge level reserved for elite level members of hotel loyalty programmes or those on specially negotiated corporate rates. How much could I pay for an upgrade to a bigger/better room or suite?Most hotel desk clerks are weary of guests asking for something for nothing. But by offering to pay slightly more than your reserved rate, you could end up with a much better room. The amount will vary based on how busy the hotel is, and how many higher tier rooms are available. You’ll never know how much it will cost to get an upgrade unless you ask… so ask! You might be surprised. Have you ever talked your way into an upgrade? How did it go for you? Please leave your advice on our Facebook page. Chris McGinnis is the business travel columnist for BBC Travel Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"To book a better hotel room, engage the front desk clerk in choosing the best room for you by making specific requests, such as good Wi-Fi reception, a newly renovated or quiet room, a large well-lit desk, or inquiring about potential upgrades.

Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992.

The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting. The South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees. \\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said. However, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future. \\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.

This time I just fell into a sewer. Next time I didn't know what would happen. Maybe I would be knocked down by a car or something else. It was horrible. Jenny may be famous for her mistake. After that, she was laughed at by her friends and workmates. She _ what she had done. But it was too late. However, she wasn't the only one who got into trouble while texting on the phone. In 2008, more than 1000 Englishmen visited hospital for similar reasons. They were walking and texting or talking on the phone. Suddenly a wall appeared! Or a hole or something like that got in the way. There were cuts, bumps, broken bones and even worse result happened on them. So we must be careful when we are walking. Don't send messages or talk with somebody on the phone while walking. Or you may hurt yourself and become another Jenny in the future. Question: The story happened in _ last Saturday night.

A:","response":"Microwaves and radio waves are both types of electromagnetic waves, which differ in their frequency and wavelength. The energy of an electromagnetic wave is directly proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength. The reason microwaves have higher energy than radio waves is due to their higher frequency and shorter wavelength. To understand this, let's examine the electromagnetic spectrum, which categorizes electromagnetic waves based on their frequencies and wavelengths. The electromagnetic spectrum can be organized as follows from the lowest to the highest frequency (and correspondingly, from the longest to the shortest wavelength): 1. Radio waves 2. Microwaves 3. Infrared waves 4. Visible light 5. Ultraviolet rays 6. X-rays 7. Gamma rays As you can see, microwaves are positioned next to radio waves in this sequence, which implies that they have a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than radio waves. Now, let's consider the relationship between the energy (E), frequency (f), and the Planck's constant (h), which is represented by the formula: E = h × f Where 'E' is the energy of the electromagnetic wave, 'h' is the Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 × 10^(-34) Js), and 'f' is the frequency of the wave. Since microwaves have a higher frequency than radio waves, the product (h × f) will be higher for microwaves than for radio waves. Therefore, microwaves have higher energy than radio waves according to this equation."},{"question":"Nemůže mít sex, než dobere antibiotika. Translate to English","response":"The phrase \\"Nemůže mít sex, než dobere antibiotika\\" in Czech translates to \\"Cannot have sex until they finish antibiotics\\" in English. This statement suggests that someone is currently undergoing a course of antibiotics and should abstain from engaging in sexual activity until the treatment is completed. It is often advised to avoid sexual activity while taking antibiotics, especially if being treated for a sexually transmitted infection or when experiencing side effects that could make sexual activity uncomfortable or unsafe. Additionally, some antibiotics may interfere with the effectiveness of birth control, which could potentially lead to an unintended pregnancy. It is always important to follow the doctor's advice and take all prescribed medications as directed to ensure proper treatment and recovery. Following these guidelines not only protects the individual taking the antibiotics but also their sexual partner(s), who might be at risk of contracting an infection or experiencing complications related to the illness being treated. In summary, the phrase highlights the importance of completing a course of antibiotics and abstaining from sexual activity during the treatment to ensure a proper recovery and protect both the individual and their partner(s) from potential risks and side effects."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to German: Two additional missions followed on July 28 , 1973 (SL-3) and November 16 , 1973 (SL-4) with stay times of 28, 59, and 84 days, respectively.

There has been mounting pressure on governments, energy companies, and citizens to explore and utilize renewable energy resources to mitigate the harmful effects of non-renewable energy consumption on the environment. Solar power, in particular, has gained prominence as an efficient, clean, and reliable energy source. Many countries have started various initiatives to boost their solar power generation capacities, resulting in substantial growth in solar panel installations across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. However, despite the many advantages of solar energy, some regions across the globe still lag behind in adopting this technology. One of the primary reasons behind this is the high initial cost of solar panel installation and maintenance, which often deters individuals and small business owners from adopting this technology. Another significant challenge is the geographic location and weather patterns; cloudy regions tend to receive less sunlight, making solar energy less efficient in certain areas of the world. In order to address these barriers and promote solar energy adoption, researchers and engineers are continuously working on improving the technology and exploring innovative ways to maximize solar energy utilization. One such promising concept is the use of solar panels with integrated energy storage systems. Hypothesis: Integrating energy storage systems into solar panels will substantially increase the efficiency and feasibility of solar energy technology, making it more accessible and attractive to a wider range of potential users. This improvement in technology will lead to widespread adoption of solar energy across various geographic locations and diverse consumer groups, significantly contributing to the global shift towards sustainable energy resources."},{"question":"Select from options: Continue writing the next sentence.

The change was welcomed by Conservative mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith, who said it would avert \\"spurious\\" action. Labour candidate Sadiq Khan claimed the move had been timed to \\"destabilise\\" negotiations over the Night Tube. A series of Tube walkouts had been planned for dates in January and February, but Aslef, the Transport Salaried Staff Association and Unite have all agreed to suspend the action. Rail, Maritime and Transport union reps will make a decision on Monday. Ballots currently require a simple majority to back action. But under the Trade Union Bill currently before Parliament, ballots in core services would need to attract a turnout of 50% or more - with at least 40% voting in favour - in order to be deemed lawful. The government has now signalled its intention to include Underground, bus and tram drivers, conductors, guards and safety staff under those rules. However, the strikes which took place in the capital last year would have met those conditions. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash accused the government of \\"trying to ban strikes by the back door\\". But Employment Minister Nick Boles described the thresholds as \\"fairly balanced\\" with the right to strike. Mr Goldsmith hailed the Tube service as \\"essential\\" and said the new criteria for industrial action would help avoid \\"strikes on spurious grounds with little real support\\".

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s?, what is it ?

Mental disorders can manifest in various ways, including emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. In many cases, these symptoms can be hidden or masked by individuals who have adapted to coping mechanisms or have learned to manage their condition effectively. Additionally, some mental disorders are less obvious and may not have noticeable outward signs. Answer: Yes, there are mental disorders that a person can hide. Some examples include high-functioning depression, anxiety disorders, and certain personality disorders. It is important to note that the ability to hide a mental disorder depends on the individual's coping mechanisms and the severity of their symptoms.

A:","response":"A: To provide a thorough answer to the question of who was born first between Ivo Andrić and Peter Ackroyd, it is essential to first provide some context about these two significant figures before revealing their respective birth years. Ivo Andrić was a renowned Yugoslav novelist, short story writer, and poet. He was principally known for his historical fiction, with works centered around the culture and experiences of the diverse populations of the Balkans. Born in the village of Dolac, Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andrić was raised in a period of ethnic tensions and unrest, which would later serve as a key theme in his award-winning literature. Andrić gained international recognition through his 1945 novel, \\"Na Drini ćuprija,\\" which earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. The novel, known as \\"The Bridge on the Drina\\" in English, follows the lives of several inhabitants of the eponymous town, emphasizing the diverse nature of the Balkan region and the significance of history in shaping the human experience. Peter Ackroyd, on the other hand, is an English biographer, novelist, and critic, distinguished for immersing his works in the history, mythology, and culture of England, particularly London. Some of his acclaimed titles consist of \\"London: The Biography,\\" \\"The Canterbury Tales - A Retelling,\\" and \\"The Clerkenwell Tales.\\" Ackroyd has been actively involved in the literary world since the 1970s, with his writings covering an extensive range of biographies and adaptations alongside original fiction. His eclectic and scholarly approach to writing frequently merges historical fact with fantastical fiction, establishing a unique and appealing literary style. Now, coming to the initial question, Ivo Andrić was born on October 9th, 1892. In contrast, Peter Ackroyd was born much later on October 5th, 1949. This indicates that Ivo Andrić was born first, with a 57-year gap separating the two influential authors. As a result, while both writers share a captivating talent for blending history and fiction in their works, they belong to distinct generations and literary traditions."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it.

Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period (7941185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (11851600) saw changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, as well as the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th centurymid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of Japan's self-imposed isolation, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords in particular have become frequent, and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated. - , or is a national university in Kyoto, Japan.

When Apple Inc. paid 3 billion for Beats Electronics LLC this summer, it was music to Carlyle Group LP’s ears. Only nine months earlier the Washington D.C. firm paid a bit more than 500 million for about a third of the headphone maker and a small stake in its nascent music streaming business. Carlyle had effectively replaced mobile phone maker HTC Corp., whose partnership with Beats never really panned out, and nearly doubled its money for its timely albeit short stint in business with Beats’ founding pop icons, Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. –Ryan Dezember Fleet Footed. Sept. 22, 2014 proved a defining day in merger history. Companies that closed tax-beneficial “inversion” merger deals before that date got to reap the benefits of their new arrangements, while rivals who weren’t as fleet footed were left subject to a new set of Treasury rules, effective that day, that made the deals less lucrative. Fearful of just such a shift, companies this year rushed to complete the deals, in which a U.S. acquirer buys an overseas firm and then moves for tax purposes to a foreign country with lower corporate taxes. For some companies, such as AbbVie Inc. which tried to buy the U.K.’s Shire PLC, the attempt came too late. Endo International PLC, in contrast, was an early mover, once based in Pennsylvania but now, thanks to February inversion, in Ireland. Endo showed the benefits of its foreign status with a deal this year that brings another Pennsylvania company, Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc., into its Irish fold. –Dana Mattioli Plot Twist. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. acquired a 60% stake in Hong Kong-listed ChinaVision Media Group Ltd. in March, just a few months before the Chinese e-commerce giant kicked off its long- awaited IPO process. Then, in mid-August, as Alibaba’s IPO neared, the renamed Alibaba Pictures Group Ltd. delayed its financial results due to possible accounting problems prior to the deal. The surprise raised some uncomfortable IPO road-show questions for Alibaba, whose aggressive dealmaking while working on the world’s biggest IPO ever led some investors to wonder whether it was trying to do too much. Those worries were seemingly washed away a 57% price jump since the IPO. In December, Alibaba Pictures disclosed that an external audit confirmed a lack of oversight by the previous management. –Telis Demos Bad Timing. Small firm Attiva Capital Partners Ltd. in May disclosed a 5% stake in beaten down Puerto Rican bank Doral Financial Corp., calling it undervalued and quoting musical lyrics. Only hours later, Doral revealed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had determined up to 40% of the assets the bank was counting toward its capital cushion may not count. The regulatory decision put the bank at risk of violating an earlier consent order, and the bank said it would have to review strategic plans. The stock fell more than 60% the next day. Attiva stuck with it, adding to the stake while admitting the bad timing. In recent weeks, the firm has continued maintaining, on Twitter , its bullish case for the Puerto Rican economy and the bank. Tuesday, the bank said the FBI had raided its main office. –David Benoit Negative Surprise. When Merck & Co. agreed to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. for 8.4 billion on Dec. 8, the drug giant’s investors cheered the move, sending its shares up in a down day for the overall market. That enthusiasm quickly waned, however, when hours later a judge ruled key patents on Cubist’s top-selling drug invalid. Merck shares retreated sharply on the news and are now down roughly 7% since just before the takeover was announced — wiping out more than 10 billion from its market capitalization, or more than the value of the deal. Merck has said it still believes in the deal. –Dana Cimilluca Missed Moment. In May, Hillshire Brands Co. agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods Inc. for 4.3 billion, an offer generally viewed as a generous one for Pinnacle, a hodge podge of brands including pickles and cake mixes that was majority owned by Blackstone Group LP. Many of the company’s brands are old and slow-growing, and conglomerates had fallen out of favor in deal-making. But before Pinnacle could collect its premium, a bidding war emerged for Hillshire, which ultimately agreed to sell itself to Tyson Foods Inc. for 7.7 billion. Pinnacle was left with a 163 million break-up fee. Though Pinnacle’s share price is up and Blackstone has been selling, it missed its chance at a clean exit. –Dana Mattioli Wrong Horse. The year was rife with examples of bankers who missed out on deals because they hitched their fortunes to the wrong client. In one of the biggest, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lined up with Charter Communications Inc. when the cable company sought to buy larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc. When Comcast Corp. swooped in and struck a surprise 45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable in February, Goldman was left without a role on one of the year’s biggest deals. Goldman did land a role on a subsequent, related deal Charter struck to buy subscribers from Comcast — and it still managed to be the year’s busiest merger adviser by a wide margin. –Dana Cimilluca UPDATE: Pinnacle Foods Inc. was majority-owned by Blackstone Group LP when it agreed to be sold to Hillshire Brands Co., but it no longer is.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go. Answer this question please: In which way Rob would not sink, sign A or sign B? Answer:","response":"In order to determine the safe path for Rob to take during his cross country race, he must assess the signs and the conditions of the area around each sign. It's important to consider not only the signs themselves, but also the environment and any additional factors that may provide clues as to which sign is accurate. First, Rob should observe the ground around both signs A and B. If any indication of saturated, loose sand or standing water is present in the area surrounding sign A (indicating it's quicksand), that could be a strong signal to avoid that path. In contrast, if sign B's area appears to have stable, well-drained soil and no visible signs of liquefaction, it could be a safer route to take. Additionally, Rob should look for any footprints or other indications that previous runners have passed through either path, as it can help him determine which path is more frequently traveled and therefore, might be safer. Next, Rob should consider the source of the signs. Are they official race markers put there by race organizers, or are they random signs placed by someone not connected to the event? If it’s the latter, it's possible that the signs are intentionally confusing or misleading. Rob should recall any information provided by race organizers pre-race, such as warnings about specific hazards on the racecourse, which would also help inform his decision. If Rob still cannot confidently determine which sign to trust, he should look for any other possible routes that may bypass the questionable area altogether. Alternatively, he can exercise caution by testing the ground surrounding each sign with a stick or by applying pressure with his foot before committing to a path. In summary, there is no definitive way to determine whether sign A or sign B is the safer route without assessing the environment and considering the credibility of the signs. Rob should use his judgment based on the observations he makes and any prior knowledge about the racecourse to make an informed decision about which path to take in order to avoid sinking in any potential quicksand."},{"question":"Facts: - native name: 김영운 - birth name: kim young-woon - alias: kangin - birth date: 17 january 1985 - name: kangin - image: kangin.jpg - birth place: seoul , south korea - occupation: singer actor mc radio personality Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of kangin .

Movie plot title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

While anger, open-mindedness, a biology book, smartness, and cynicism might all contribute to one's thirst for knowledge, it is essential to recognize the unique role each of these factors plays in this process. The best answer is not a single factor, but rather a combination of these elements that ultimately drive someone toward learning about the world. 1. Anger: Anger can trigger a desire for awareness and understanding, as strong emotions often serve as a catalyst for change. For instance, when confronted with injustices and global issues such as human rights, the environment, or political corruption, people may experience anger and frustration. This raw emotion can motivate them to learn more about these subjects, discover the underlying causes, and eventually take action to address them. 2. Open Mind: Having an open mind is a crucial attribute when it comes to learning about the world. A receptive and curious attitude toward new ideas, cultures, and experiences allows individuals to expand their horizons and delve into the unknown. It is through open-mindedness that people can foster an attitude of continuous learning and growth, enabling them to better understand and appreciate the world around them. 3. Biology Book: While a biology book may seem like a rather specific tool to learn about the world, it is worth noting that a comprehensive knowledge of life and its processes is one of the cornerstones of understanding our planet and the ecosystems within it. By studying biology, along with other scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and geology, individuals can gain an integrated and diverse perspective on the natural world and the factors that influence it. 4. Smartness: Intellectual capacity, or smartness, can play a significant role in one's ability to learn about the world. A well-developed cognitive aptitude can aid in retaining, processing, and applying new information, which can lead to better overall comprehension and understanding of complex subjects. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that smartness alone is not a guarantee for learning about the world. A blend of intrinsic motivation, curiosity, and determination is equally as significant in driving the learning process. 5. Cynicism: A cynical approach might initially appear counterintuitive when aiming to learn about the world, but in some cases, it could serve as a powerful motivator. Cynicism may arise from doubt and skepticism toward established beliefs or systems, spurring an individual to question the status quo and ultimately seek out the truth. This questioning mindset can foster critical thinking skills, driving a person to unmask fallacies and seek a deeper understanding of various subjects. In conclusion, it is the interplay of these elements – anger, open-mindedness, a biology book, smartness, and cynicism – that drives an individual to learn about the world. Each factor brings its unique contribution to the learning process, inspiring curiosity, reflection, and critical thinking. Ultimately, the most effective approach to learning about the world involves embracing a diverse range of perspectives and qualities, harnessing the power of experience, and fostering an unwavering thirst for knowledge."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you will be presented with a question in Persian.

Pick from: [I] Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of heart disease.. [II] Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of fungal disease..","response":"Option II is the better solution for effectively watering plants. The overarching goal in this context is to provide plants with the necessary moisture while minimizing the risk of disease or harm to the plants themselves. Let's break down the two options presented and discuss why option II is a more preferable solution: Option I: Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of heart disease. In this option, the first part of the statement that mentions watering plants in the morning is indeed beneficial. The reason being that during the morning, the temperatures are cooler, and as a result, the water evaporates at a much slower rate. This allows for plants to have ample time to absorb the water and stay hydrated throughout the day. Watering your plants in the hot afternoon can result in rapid water evaporation, which may not give the plants enough time to absorb the moisture they need and might lead to underwatering. However, the second part of this statement is misplaced in the context of watering plants effectively. The mention of \\"less chance of heart disease\\" is not relevant to plants, as they do not have hearts. Heart diseases are a health concern for humans and animals but do not apply to plants. Option II: Water evaporates faster in the hot afternoon, so morning soaks are better—plus, cooler temps mean less chance of fungal disease. Similar to option I, this option also highlights the benefits of watering plants during the cooler morning hours to ensure more effective water absorption and less evaporation. The second part of this statement is more relevant to the context of assisting the efficient growth and well-being of plants. Fungal diseases can occur due to excess moisture, especially when plants are watered during warmer periods, as this creates a favorable environment for fungi to grow. Watering plants in the morning when temperatures are cooler not only ensures that water evaporates at a slower rate but also reduces the likelihood of fungal diseases. This means that the plants can efficiently absorb the moisture they require while not being put at risk of contracting harmful fungal infections. In conclusion, option II is the better solution for watering plants effectively, as it focuses on both efficient water absorption and minimizing the risk of fungal diseases, whereas option I has an irrelevant connection with heart disease, which does not apply to plants."},{"question":"Lizzy: Sara makes cakes during the five weekdays to sell on weekends.

The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2. 1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, \\"Burning Down the House\\". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last. Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere\\"), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and the accordion-driven track \\"Radio Head\\", which became the etymon of the band of the same name. Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on \\"hiatus\\". It took until December 1991 for an official announcement to be made that Talking Heads had broken up. Their final release was \\"Sax and Violins\\", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. During this breakup period, Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in the summer of 1990.

The answer is:","response":"No, the correct answer is not \\"legs.\\" Instead, the correct answer is that most arthropods have six legs. When you ask about the number of legs that most arthropods have, it's essential to provide a numeric answer representing the majority of arthropods and their leg count. Arthropods are a group of invertebrate animals that include insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and others. They all have an exoskeleton, a segmented body, and jointed appendages. These jointed appendages, which include legs, are a major characteristic of arthropods. However, it's important to differentiate between various groups of arthropods, since not all arthropods have six legs. Here's a breakdown of the number of legs in different arthropod groups: 1. Insects: As the most diverse and largest group of arthropods, insects typically have six legs. Some common examples include ants, bees, butterflies, and beetles. 2. Arachnids: This group of arthropods includes spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites. They possess eight legs, which distinguishes them from insects. 3. Crustaceans: Crustaceans are primarily aquatic arthropods, such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. They usually have ten legs. 4. Myriapods: This group consists of centipedes and millipedes, which have numerous legs. Centipedes usually have one pair of legs per body segment, while millipedes have two pairs per segment. In summary, while the majority of arthropods, specifically insects, have six legs, it's important to recognize the variations in leg count among other groups of arthropods. Thus, the correct answer to the question \\"how many legs do most arthropods have?\\" is six legs."},{"question":"Women looking to jump-start their sex life may want to spend more time in bed. Sleeping. That's the conclusion of a new study that suggests that each additional hour of sleep increased by 14 percent the likelihood a woman would engage in sexual activity with a partner the next day. \\"Our study showed that good sleep is important for healthy sexual desire and arousal in women, even when women are psychiatrically and medically healthy,\\" said study author David Kalmbach, a researcher at the University of Michigan Sleep and Circadian Research Laboratory. Kalmbach and several colleagues evaluated 171 women, all college-age, who kept diaries of their sleep for 14 consecutive days and reported whether they engaged in sexual activity the next day. Longer sleep time was linked with greater sexual desire the next day. Women with longer average sleep duration said they had better genital arousal than women with shorter sleep time. On average, the women reported sleeping 7 hours, 22 minutes. Other studies have suggested that short sleep time and poor sleep quality lead to poor female sexual response, Kalmbach said. But most studies have been a ''snapshot in time,\\" looking at just one time point. \\"I think these findings suggest that taking a closer look at sleep health in women with sexual complaints is a worthwhile endeavor,\\" Kalmbach said, \\"as poor sleep may lead to sexual problems.\\" Kalmbach said it's not known how lack of sleep might affect sexual desire. But he said it's not simply due to changes in mood, for instance, as the study assessed the women's levels of depression and anxiety. \\"Some previous studies have hypothesized that sleep can affect hormone levels, which may cause changes in desire and arousal,\\" he said. \\"But I think overall, more research is needed in this area to identify the underlying mechanisms more confidently.\\" \\"The message,\\" Kalmbach added, \\"is that sleep health is important for many areas of our daily living. Good sleep has been shown to improve mood, energy, concentration, overall health, and, now, sexual desire and arousal.\\" The study findings were published online March 16 in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. Dr. Nathaniel F. Watson is president-elect of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and professor of neurology at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He called the new research \\"one of the few studies to assess the relationship between sleep duration and sexual health.\\" But, he added, \\"you have to be a little bit cautious about drawing any conclusions from this because it is just an association study,\\" and doesn't prove cause-and-effect. Even so, Watson added, \\"I still think the findings are compelling and certainly warrant follow-up with interventional studies.\\" For now, Watson said the take-home message is this: \\"You could add it to a long list of reasons why getting a proper amount of sleep is good for your health.\\" Kalmbach had this advice: \\"It there's anything women or their partners can do to help promote good sleep for one another, whether it's helping out around the house to reduce workload, planning romantic getaways, or just practicing good sleep hygiene, it could help protect against having problems in the bedroom.\\" ||||| The full text of this article hosted at iucr.org is unavailable due to technical difficulties. ||||| Photo A good night’s sleep may be important for a woman’s sex life, a small study suggests. Researchers recruited 171 female college students, who completed well-validated questionnaires about sexual distress, depression and anxiety. Then every morning for the next two weeks, the study participants completed questionnaires on sexual function over the past 24 hours and sleep quality the night before, including how long it took to fall asleep and total sleep time. The study is online in The Journal of Sexual Medicine. In women who were in romantic relationships, each extra hour of sleep corresponded to higher levels of sexual desire, and a 14 percent increase in the likelihood of sexual activity the next day. Women with longer average sleep duration reported greater vaginal lubrication during sex than those with shorter average sleep. These effects persisted even after controlling for age, sexual distress, daytime feelings of happiness or sadness, fatigue and the presence of menstruation. “Getting more sleep should not be expected to magically fix all sexual problems,” said the lead author, David A. Kalmbach, a postdoctoral resident at the University of Michigan. “Sexual problems often have multiple contributing factors, including mood, relationship quality, partner availability and, now we know, sleep health. I think it is important for women and health care professionals to be mindful of the relationship between sleep and sexual response.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"A new study has found that each additional hour of sleep increases by 14 percent the likelihood a woman would engage in sexual activity with a partner the next day.

She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston.

Just maybe Sin, who scored twice and hit a solo homer, will indeed get his wish to meet Park Geun-hye. He's famous back in his homeland -- along with all of his teammates. Jae Yeong Hwang drove in two runs and combined with Hae Chan Choi, who weathered a late Chicago rally, to lead the Asia-Pacific Region champions to an 8-4 win in Sunday's LLWS championship game. Hwang, who was removed because he wasn't feeling well, gave up one hit in two-plus innings while striking out four. He also drove in his team's first two runs as they built an 8-1 lead before Jackie Robinson West made it close. \\"I'm very joyful. It's a wonderful feeling,\\" Hwang said. \\"I don't know why I'm even here; I didn't play very good today.\\" Choi, who had a homer and scored twice, pitched the last four innings for South Korea, which won its third title after back-to-back championships in 1984 and \`85. But even he got a little nervous at the end after Chicago collected four of its six hits and scored three times. \\"I knew I could allow some runs,\\" he said. \\"After I got the second out, I thought I could do it. But after I gave up the three runs I was (worried).\\" International teams have won the last three and four of the last five titles. Brandon Green went 5-2/3 innings for Chicago, which had survived four straight knockout games before the final. After the final out, a force play, the Seoul team's bench emptied and the players dumped cups of water on their teammates near the mound. The players took a victory lap, waving and laughing.

South Korean fans, brightly dressed in flowing satin robes of yellow and electric blue, danced with large fans in the latter innings. Chicago, the Great Lakes Region champions, came back from 3-0 and 5-4 deficits to beat favored West champ Las Vegas Mountain Ridge 7-5 in the U.S. title game on Saturday. Earlier, South Korea, the Asia-Pacific Region winner, rolled over Japan, 12-3. But they couldn't come back against the powerful South Koreans, who asserted themselves early. Leadoff hitter Choi drilled the very first pitch over the wall in right, but a few feet foul. He then flied out deep to right. Sin followed by smacking a screaming liner to center that slipped out of the glove of DJ Butler for a two-base error. Hwang's double brought in the first run. With one out in the third, Choi walked and Sin singled sharply up the middle. After a double steal, Choi came home on Hwang's ground-out to third. Hwang set down the first six Chicago hitters, four on strikeouts. Butler broke up Hwang's no-hitter with a spinning cue shot to short that he beat out leading off the third. That was all for Hwang after he had mentioned to his coaches that he was sick between innings. He traded places with first baseman Choi, who was greeted by shortstop Ed Howard's bouncer to the mound that was scored a single, prompting the first prolonged chants of \\"U-S-A!\\" for the day. Choi then fanned Cameron Bufford before leadoff hitter Pierce Jones -- who had three homers in the LLWS opener but was just 1 for 12 since -- walked to load the bases with one out. That brought up Trey Hondras, who had a homer and three RBIs in the U.S. final, and his high hopper to second on a nice grab by Jin Woo Jeon scored Butler. The rally died when Marquis Jackson bounced out sharply to third on the next pitch. Ji Ho Park doubled and came around on pinch-hitter Jun Ha Yoo's single in the fourth. After Sin pounded the ball over the wall near the camera bay in left center in the fifth, a U.S. fan threw the ball back on the field.

In Tanzania, it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist. While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.[citation needed] Where does the typical safari hunter hang his hat at night?","response":"The typical safari hunter usually stays in tented camps at night, according to the article. These camps are often set up in remote areas that are less appealing to the usual ecotourist. The choice to stay in such places is influenced by the nature of hunting safaris which often involve tracking and hunting game in secluded, wild terrains, unlike ecotourism which usually involves observing wildlife and other natural attractions in a more comfortable setting. Tented camps used by safari hunters aren't simply a collection of rudimentary shelters, but are often fully serviced, providing amenities to meet the needs of the hunters. These might include crews who can prepare meals, hot showers, and some level of bedding comfort. These camps can range from being relatively Spartan, with just the necessary features, to very luxurious, with features comparable to those found in high-end hotels. However, despite the level of comfort provided, these tented camps retain an inherent ruggedness, being situated in close proximity to nature and typically in locations far from city life or luxury accommodations. This embraces the spirit of hunting and allows hunters to fully immerse themselves in the experience, while also providing some basic comforts. Safari hunters' patronage of such accommodations is beneficial in various ways. Additionally to providing revenue to local communities, these camps also have the benefit of making use of remote areas that the average photo tourist may find uninviting. This supports regional economic development, promotes wildlife conservation efforts, and supports anti-poaching activities, all of which advocates argue are significant advantages of safari hunting."},{"question":"Select from the following.

A foreign ministry statement said that Obama's \\"fallacious, intemperate and interventionist declaration\\" will lead toward deteriorating relations between the countries and \\"confirms to the world the policy of aggression his government maintains against our country.\\" The statement read by Foreign Minister Elias Jaua on state television referred to comments the U.S. president made to Spanish-language television network Univision during his trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. In the interview that aired Friday, Obama wouldn't say if the United States recognizes Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela's new president following elections that have been disputed by the opposition. When asked, he replied that it's up to the people of Venezuela to choose their leaders in legitimate elections. He also said that reports indicate that basic principles of human rights, democracy, press freedom and freedom of assembly were not observed in Venezuela following the election. \\"Venezuela rejects with all the force of its Bolivarian dignity the declaration by United States President Barack Obama which again attacks the legitimate Venezuelan government,\\" the foreign ministry statement said. Maduro, the hand-picked successor to late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, narrowly won April 14 presidential elections.

He moved from the town after he witnessed his brother, Wayne, murdered by a gang of greasers in 1963. The murderers themselves were killed shortly afterward by an oncoming train, having parked on the tracks. Jim has nightmares about his brother's murder as he starts teaching in the town. Students that are close to him start to be involved in various accidents that look like suicides. One by one, students are slain so the greasers, disguised as living teens, can return to class. The greasers plan to kill Jim the same way they murdered Wayne to keep themselves out of Hell. They intend to have a child witness the event, leading them to try to kidnap Jim's son Scott. Jim finds out that there is a way to let his own brother return. The gang also needs the remaining living member of their gang, Carl Mueller, who left before the train struck. Jim finds Carl, who panics, thinking Jim wants revenge. He runs back to town, fulfilling the gang's plan for a reunion. The gang harasses Jim's family to ensure Jim's compliance in reenacting the murder. After the gang releases the family, Jim hides them inside a church, which the demonic gang cannot enter. Jim tries to bring his brother back in the church's graveyard as the gang lures his wife and son outside and hold them hostage. Jim finds that something is blocking Wayne's return, and must cooperate with the thugs in reenacting the murder. It also reveals that when Jim was a boy, Jim took the murderers' car keys that lead to their deaths. Jim recovered the keys. He returns to the train tunnel in which the first murder took place, though both he and Carl change their dialogue and actions from those taken 27 years before. Frustrated, the gang leader stabs Carl, which allows Wayne to come back. Wayne distracts the gang while Jim gets his family out of the gang's car. Jim gave the gang back their car keys.

Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to. Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.","response":"To determine whether Greg's lake (in Texas) has more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's lake (in Illinois), let's consider the information provided step by step: 1. Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away. 2. The fertilizer, which contains nitrogen, ends up in bodies of water. 3. Nitrogen in the water causes algae to grow out of control. 4. Algae consume carbon dioxide in the water. 5. When algae die, decomposers break down their dead tissue, using up the oxygen in the water and creating dead zones. Now, let's apply these points to the information about Greg and Jim's farms: - Greg lives in Texas, where there is less rain, so there will be less runoff carrying dissolved fertilizer into the lake. This will lead to less nitrogen in the water and, consequently, less algae growth. As a result, there will likely be a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in Greg's lake since the lesser presence of algae won't significantly reduce it. - Jim lives in Illinois, where there is more rain, leading to more runoff dissolving and carrying fertilizer to the lake. This will make the nitrogen concentration in the water higher, promoting more algae growth. An increased presence of algae will consume more carbon dioxide in the water. This means that Jim's lake will likely have a lower concentration of carbon dioxide. Conclusion: Greg's lake (in Texas) will likely have more carbon dioxide than Jim's lake (in Illinois)."},{"question":"Read this: Just over a quarter of the jobs available in the city are in the health and education sector.

Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: \\"I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive\\"). Better still, this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight).

The total eclipse could be seen starting in India on Wednesday morning and moving eastward across China and parts of the Pacific. Millions cast their eyes towards the heavens to catch an unusual view of the sun's colorful ring. Cloud in some areas prevented people from fully enjoying the sight. Still, many were frightened. The total eclipse occurs about twice a year as the moon passes between the earth and the sun on the same plane as earth's circle. The local astronomy society gave a flash on how an eclipse happens. Wednesday's event lasted up to more than six minutes in some places. In India, thousands bathed in the Ganges River in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi to clean their souls. It was sunny sky in Hong Kong for the eclipse, where students, parents and the elderly flooded in a primary school to watch.

This tradition is rooted in the custom followed by the various bishops where they combine their ecclesiastical title, name, and the location of their diocese. Therefore, the way the Bishop of Exeter signs his name encompasses all these elements. Firstly, the bishop signs with the Latin abbreviation \\"Epus,\\" short for \\"Episcopus,\\" meaning \\"Bishop.\\" This title signifies his status within the church hierarchy. As the Bishop of Exeter, \\"Exon\\" is added after \\"Epus,\\" which is short for \\"Exoniensis\\" in Latin, referring specifically to the diocese of Exeter. Subsequently, the Bishop appends his initials, which represent his personal identity. Since the incumbent bishop at the time of writing this response is Robert Exon, he would include his first initial, \\"R,\\" for Robert and his last initial, \\"A,\\" for Atwell. However, it's important to note that this aspect of the signature would change according to the person holding the title, as bishops are elected, resign or otherwise leave their position. To summarize, in the case of the current Bishop of Exeter, the signature would read \\"Epus Exon. R. A.,\\" denoting his episcopal title, his relationship to the diocese of Exeter, and his initials. This format and style of signing may vary slightly across different regions or denominations. This signature reflects the long-standing tradition of recognizing bishops as both spiritual leaders and key representatives of their diocese within the broader Church of England."},{"question":"Give the rationale and then the answer.

The New Testament focuses on the life, teachings, and works of Jesus Christ and his followers, while the Old Testament contains ancient writings of the history, law, and prophecies of the Israelite people. 2. \\"as a sacred sculpture\\": The term \\"sculpture\\" is not appropriate for describing sacred texts, as it typically refers to three-dimensional artistic works. Instead, the New Testament would be considered a sacred scripture or text, not a sculpture. Based on our analysis, the sentence is factually incorrect. Answer: - no"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Tha Pataudi trophy is named after a cricket player born in which year ?

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the total payment before the tip. To do this, we will multiply the number of hours the singer was hired for by the hourly rate. In this case, that is 3 hours * 15/hour. 3 hours * 15/hour = 45 Step 2: Calculate the amount of the tip based on the total payment. To do this, we will find 20% of the total payment. To find the percentage of a number, we need to multiply the number by the percentage (as a decimal). In this case, that is 45 * 0.20. 45 * 0.20 = 9 Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid, including the tip. To do this, we will add the total payment and the tip together. In this case, that is 45 (total payment) + 9 (tip). 45 + 9 = 54 So, Mark paid a total of 54 to the singer."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What key details about koki eto can be extracted from the following bio?

Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

This sentence translates to: \\"That is why you want to make sure that your cargo is handled by experienced specialists who can offer flexible, individualized, and complex solutions.\\" When translating between languages, it is essential to maintain the meaning and context of the text, while also adapting it to the target language's grammar, syntax, and cultural nuances. The sentence provided in English is well-structured and doesn't contain any idiomatic phrases or slang, making it relatively straightforward to translate into Russian. Starting with \\"That is why,\\" we can translate it to \\"Вот почему\\" in Russian, which is a common expression to explain a reason or cause. The second part of the sentence, \\"you want to ensure that,\\" can be translated to \\"вы хотите убедиться, что,\\" which means \\"you want to make sure that.\\" It is important to notice that in Russian, the verb \\"to ensure\\" or \\"to make sure\\" is often accompanied by the reflexive particle \\"ся,\\" which denotes a reflexive action involving the person or people performing the action. The next portion, \\"your cargo is handled,\\" can be translated to \\"ваш груз обрабатывается.\\" The noun \\"cargo\\" translates to \\"груз,\\" while \\"is handled\\" translates to \\"обрабатывается,\\" which is the passive form of the verb \\"обрабатывать\\" (to handle or process). In this case, the passive voice is appropriate, as the cargo is being handled by someone else (the specialists). Now, let's translate \\"by experienced specialists,\\" which can be rendered as \\"опытными специалистами.\\" The adjective \\"experienced\\" has a direct equivalent in Russian – \\"опытный,\\" while \\"specialists\\" can be translated as \\"специалисты.\\" Continuing with \\"who can offer,\\" we can translate it to \\"которые могут предлагать,\\" where \\"которые\\" is a relative pronoun meaning \\"who\\" or \\"which,\\" and \\"могут предлагать\\" means \\"can offer\\" (from the verb \\"предлагать\\" – to offer). Lastly, we translate \\"flexible, individualized, and complex solutions\\" to \\"гибкие, индивидуализированные и сложные решения.\\" The adjectives \\"гибкие\\" (flexible), \\"индивидуализированные\\" (individualized), and \\"сложные\\" (complex) accurately describe the characteristics of the \\"solutions\\" (решения) desired. As a result, the full translation reads: \\"Вот почему вы хотите убедиться, что ваш груз обрабатывается опытными специалистами, которые могут предлагать гибкие, индивидуализированные и сложные решения.\\""},{"question":"The tournament was resumed in 2006 in San Francisco , where it was hosted for two years .

Follow these steps: 1. Research academic studies on the impact of education quality on student outcomes: Look for academic studies and journals in educational research that analyze the correlation between high-quality education and student achievement. These may include research on teaching methodologies, classroom management, and effective use of resources. Justification: Academic research provides a solid foundation for drawing evidence-based conclusions on the effectiveness of quality education. 2. Collect statistical data on student achievement in different states: Compare educational achievement data from states with high-quality education systems against those where the quality is comparatively lacking. Key data may include literacy rates, graduation rates, and standardized test scores. Justification: Examining the educational outcomes of students from different states enables us to make informed conclusions about the effectiveness of high-quality state-managed education systems. 3. Analyze case studies of successful state interventions: Document instances where state education management has improved educational quality in struggling schools with specific initiatives. These case studies may include school turnaround programs, using proven teaching methods, or increasing educational resources. Justification: Case studies provide real examples of how state-managed intervention can lead to improved education quality, further supporting the claim. 4. Solicit expert opinions and testimonials from educators: Collect the opinions of education professionals, such as teachers and school administrators, to gather qualitative data on the need for high-quality education, the impact on students, and the potential for state management to positively influence education quality. Justification: Educators are directly involved in the education process and thus can provide valuable insights into the implications of high-quality state-managed education. 5. Research international comparisons: Compare the United States' educational performance with other countries' education systems, emphasizing those with higher ranks and more successful outcomes. Investigate the factors contributing to their success and how these can be incorporated into the state-managed education system in the United States. Justification: International comparisons provide a wider context and suggest that improvements in state-managed education quality can lead to better global competitiveness. By collecting and analyzing evidence from these various sources, we can establish a robust case supporting the claim that improving the quality of state-managed education has beneficial outcomes for students and society as a whole."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question.

They and thousands of others are competing in the Waddell & Reed Kansas City Marathon. The runners will take off from the starting line at 22nd Street and Grand Boulevard, across from Crown Center, at 7:05 a.m. Saturday. \\"I believe in the saying, ‘Inch by inch, it is a cinch,'\\" said marathon runner Rick Roeber.

The Kansas City Marathon will mark Roeber's 75th marathon and it will be his 57th barefoot marathon.

Babcock happened to pick up knitting and running around the same time. \\"It took a long time to do distance running. It takes a long time to do knitting. I thought these could go together. They are both kind of tedious. I thought it would be a fun challenge,\\" he said. During their training for the marathon, both men turned heads. \\"People laugh. They think it's funny,\\" Babcock said. \\"Usually I chalk it up to the fact that it just kind of blurts out of their mouth. It's what they are thinking. It kind of blurts out, 'You don't have any shoes on?' and I say, 'Yes you are right. I don't have any shoes on,'\\" Roeber said. Both runners are motivated to cross the finish line in their own unique way. \\"This is a big milestone for me because a lot of people said I wouldn't be running barefoot after a year,\\" Roeber said. \\"I think it will be great particularly for my kids to be able to say, 'Dad did it. Dad broke a record.' Hopefully that will lead them to their own proud moments,\\" Babcock said. Both men said they are using their passion for running to raise awareness for charities.

The Guinness scarf knitting record was previously held by Susie Hewer, who in 2008 at the Flora London Marathon made a scarf measuring 5 feet, 2 inches long. Hewer broke her record in April, again in London, with a 6 foot, 9 inch scarf. How long was Babcocks red, orange and purple scarf? Drum roll, please. Twelve feet, 13/4 inches, as measured by knitting experts Cindy Craig of Kansas City and Traci Bunkers of Lawrence and by Jim Josten, president of an accredited instrument and gauge calibration service who will verify to Guinness the authenticity of Babcocks accomplishment. For the technically minded, Babcock used a garter stitch, 30 stitches wide, and size 15 plastic needles. And he finished the marathon in 5 hours, 48 minutes and 27 seconds. Babcock, 41, began running and knitting as separate activities about three years ago. Because both can grow tedious, he decided to combine them. It took experimentation. The yarn, which he keeps in a pack on his waist, had to be acrylic; natural fibers pick up sweat. Babcock devised a technique for tying the lengthening scarves around his waist and cinching them to a carabiner. Except for one fall early in his knitting-while-running career, when he didnt notice a pothole, Babcock hasnt had any mishaps running with needles. I have a very smooth gait, he said. Like Hewer, who runs to raise money for Alzheimers disease research, Babcock hopes that people will donate to the Alzheimers Association. A link to the association can be found on his website, www.donotstaple.com. |||||Summary:","response":"In 2013, the Waddell & Reed Kansas City Marathon saw a unique participant, David Babcock, attempting to break a world record for knitting the longest scarf while running a marathon. Combining his two hobbies, distance running and knitting, Babcock aimed to surpass the 6-foot 9-inch record held by Susie Hewer from the United Kingdom. Using a garter stitch, 30 stitches wide, and size 15 plastic needles, Babcock successfully broke the Guinness world record by knitting a 12-foot, 1.75-inch scarf during the marathon. Both Babcock and Hewer use their unique running skills to raise awareness for charities, with Babcock running to support Alzheimer's research."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Buy your favorite pens in bulk.

A good pen can make all the difference when it comes to the writing experience. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply someone who enjoys putting pen to paper, investing in quality pens, and taking good care of them is essential. In this article, we will explore some of the top pen-related tips and tricks to enhance your writing experience. Discover why buying your favorite pens in bulk, investing in premium pens and inks, and properly storing and maintaining your pens can make all the difference. 1. Buy Your Favorite Pens in Bulk Step 1: Determine the types of pens you prefer It's important to understand your personal pen preferences and identify your favorite pens. Determine if you prefer ballpoint, rollerball, gel, or fountain pens. Each type has its own characteristics and your preference may vary depending on your writing style and needs. Step 2: Find a reputable pen supplier Locate reputable pen suppliers that sell your favorite pens. This may vary between online stores, local stationery shops, or even direct from the manufacturer. Make sure to compare prices and read customer reviews when selecting a supplier to ensure you purchase your pens from a trustworthy source. Step 3: Purchase in bulk When you've identified your preferred pen and supplier, buy your pens in bulk. This not only saves you money in the long run but also ensures that you have a readily available supply of your favorite pens whenever you need them. 2. Invest in a Premium Pen and Ink Step 1: Research premium pen brands and models Premium pens are known for their high quality, smooth writing performance, and stylish design. They often have a better ink flow and finer nibs compared to regular pens. To identify a premium pen that suits your needs, research and compare various brands and models. Read expert reviews and user feedback to make an informed decision. Step 2: Select high-quality ink Just as important as a premium pen is the quality of the ink. High-quality inks ensure smoother and more consistent writing without any skips or blotting. Opt for well-known ink brands and don't forget to consider factors like ink drying time and resistance to smudging and fading. Step 3: Consider pen and ink compatibility Premium pens often have specific ink requirements. Make sure the ink you choose is compatible with your pen, as using the wrong ink might damage the pen or adversely affect its performance. 3. Store and Maintain Your Pens Properly Step 1: Store pens horizontally Storing your pens horizontally, with the nib pointing up or down, can prevent ink from settling into the nib and feed. This can help maintain a smoother ink flow and prevent any leaks or spills. Step 2: Clean your pens regularly Regularly cleaning your pens, especially fountain pens, is essential for their performance and longevity. Schedule time to clean your pens, removing any dried ink or debris from the nib and feed. This ensures that your pens function at their best and prevents any issues with ink flow or writing quality. Step 3: Protect your pens from extreme temperatures Keep your pens away from extreme heat or cold, as this can affect the ink's consistency and flow. Store them in a controlled environment, such as a pen case or drawer, to maintain optimal performance. Conclusion By following these simple tips and tricks, you can significantly enhance your writing experience and create a more enjoyable and satisfying routine. Do yourself a favor and invest in quality pens, ink, and proper storage. Your writing will thank you for it!"},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"First, I need to choose a language other than English.

The detective on the case, Lt. Stevenson, quickly finds multiple witnesses putting Peralta's lover, Terry Collins, at the scene. However, when Stevenson finds Terry and questions her, she has an iron-clad alibi with multiple witnesses. It is revealed that Terry has an identical twin sister, Ruth, and the pair share the same job and routinely switch places for their own benefit. Stevenson and the district attorney are unable to prosecute, since the twins refuse to confirm which one of them has the alibi. Unable to accept the \\"perfect crime\\", Lt. Stevenson asks Dr. Scott Elliot for help. Scott is an expert on twin study, and has been routinely encountering the Collins twins at their shared place of work, but does not know which one is which. As a front, Scott asks Terry and Ruth if he can study both of them individually as part of his research. The twins accept, though Ruth is worried that Scott might find out that Terry was at Peralta's apartment the night of the murder. However, Terry is attracted to Scott and insists that they can keep the secret for the sake of seeing him. She also comforts Ruth, reminding her that she was only at Peralta's apartment but didn't kill him. From Scott's psychological tests and by spending time with them, he discovers that Ruth is kind and loving, while Terry is highly intelligent, insane, and has been manipulating Ruth almost their entire lives. Terry is jealous that people keep preferring Ruth over her, and is again enraged when Scott falls in love with Ruth instead of her.

Determining whether a linguist would rate this sentence as acceptable requires a deeper examination of various aspects of linguistics, including syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and register. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the structure of a sentence and the arrangement of words in a grammatically acceptable manner. In the sentence, \\"I'm glad anybody likes me!\\" the basic English syntactic construction Subject-Verb-Object is preserved: Subject: \\"I\\" Verb: \\"am\\" (contracted to \\"'m\\") Object: \\"glad anybody likes me.\\" While the structure appears fine at first glance, it may be unusual to use \\"anybody\\" in this affirmative context. 2. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. The sentence in question appears semantically problematic due to the use of the indefinite pronoun \\"anybody\\" in an affirmative context. In English, it is more common to use \\"somebody\\" or \\"someone\\" rather than \\"anybody\\" when conveying the meaning of the sentence. \\"Anybody\\" is typically used in questions and negative statements. Thus, the sentence could be rephrased as, \\"I'm glad somebody likes me!\\" to reflect a more natural semantic construction. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics deals with the interpretation and understanding of a sentence within its specific context, including speaker intention and listener interpretation. In this sentence, if we consider the intended meaning to be that the speaker is expressing happiness at the fact that at least one person likes them, it would be more appropriate to use \\"somebody\\" or \\"someone.\\" The use of \\"anybody\\" could potentially create confusion or misinterpretation in the listener by suggesting that the speaker is not expressing genuine happiness or appreciation. 4. Register: The register relates to the level of formality or informality of language based on the context and audience. The sentence uses a contraction (\\"I'm\\"), which is generally considered informal. Additionally, the sentence's casual tone suggests that it is meant for informal communication rather than formal writing or speech. Compared to more formal or academic contexts where adherence to standard grammatical conventions is critical, informal language often allows for more flexibility. Therefore, while linguists might raise concerns about the sentence's semantics and pragmatics, its informal register would permit greater latitude in acceptability. In summary, the sentence \\"I'm glad anybody likes me!\\" may be perceived as syntactically acceptable but semantically and pragmatically unusual due to the affirmative use of \\"anybody.\\" However, given its informal register, some linguists might rate the sentence as acceptable, even though it is unconventional. Other linguists may recommend revising the sentence to \\"I'm glad somebody likes me!\\" or \\"I'm glad someone likes me!\\" for better clarity in terms of semantics and pragmatics."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Some PAE file extension formats can be opened in binary format only","response":"Some PAE file extension formats can be opened in binary format only.

To understand electronegativity, it's important first to understand what a \\"bond\\" is. Any two atoms in a molecule that are \\"connected\\" to each other on a molecular diagram are said to have a bond between them. This means that they share a set of two electrons with each atom contributing one electron to the bond. The exact reasons for why atoms share electrons and bond are a little beyond the scope of this article. If you want to learn more, try this article on the bond basics or WikiHow's own How to Study the Nature of the Chemical Bond (Chemistry). When two atoms share a set of two electrons in a bond, they don't always share them equally. When one atom has higher electronegativity than the atom it's bonded to, it pulls the two electrons in the bond closer to itself. An atom with very high electronegativity may pull the electrons all the way to its side of the bond, barely sharing them at all with the other atom. For example, in the molecule NaCl (sodium chloride), the chloride atom has a fairly high electronegativity and the sodium has a fairly low one. Thus, the electrons will get pulled towards the chloride and away from the sodium. An electronegativity table of the elements has the elements arranged exactly like in a periodic table, except that each atom is labeled with its electronegativity. These can be found in a variety of chemical textbooks and technical articles as well as online. Here is a link to an excellent electronegativity table. Note that this uses the Pauling electronegativity scale, which is most common. However, there are other ways to measure electronegativity, one of which will be shown below. If you don't have an electronegativity table handy, you can still estimate the strength of an atom's electronegativity compared to the strength of another element's atom based on where it is located on a normal periodic table. Although you will not be able to calculate a number value, you can evaluate the difference between the electronegativities of 2 different elements. As a general rule: An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move to the right in the periodic table. An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move up in the periodic table. Thus, the atoms in the top right have the highest electronegativities and the atoms in the bottom left have the lowest ones. For example, in the NaCl example from above, you can tell that chlorine has a higher electronegativity than sodium because it's almost all the way in the top right. On the other hand, sodium is far to the left, making it one of the lower-ranking atoms.","response":"This article explains electronegativity as the unequal sharing of electrons in a bond between two atoms, with higher electronegativity values in atoms to the right and up on the periodic table, and provides a link to an electronegativity table for reference."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English. I will choose Spanish because it is widely spoken and understood by many people. Step 2: Determine a subject for the sentence.

He grew up in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He recruited his brother into a terrorist movement. Article:","response":"Title: Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri: The Infamous Yemen-based Terrorist with Ties to Saudi Arabia Introduction Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, a Yemen-based terrorist, has been in the headlines for quite some time now. His deep-rooted connections, strategy, and involvement in the terror world paint a frightening picture for global security. As a prominent figure in modern terrorism, al-Asiri is a name that deserves attention and scrutiny. This article will provide an in-depth look at Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri's life, his recruitment of family members into the terrorist network, and his impact on the global stage. Early Life and Introduction to Terrorism Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri was born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. As a young man, he grew up in a time when Saudi Arabia was going through major changes, particularly with regard to the government's crackdown on extremist groups within the country. This may have had some influence on al-Asiri's initial interest in terrorism. His first brush with terrorism began when he became a member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - a militant organization that emerged during a merger between Saudi Arabian and Yemeni Islamist extremists. He quickly rose through the ranks of the organization, soon becoming a highly sought-after bomb maker and strategist. Given his expertise in bombmaking, it was only a matter of time before he ventured further into the realm of extremist activities. Recruiting his Brother into Terrorism One of al-Asiri's significant contributions to terrorism was his decision to recruit his younger brother, Abdullah al-Asiri, into the movement. Although much of Abdullah's background remains unknown, it is evident that his older sibling had a profound impact on him, convincing him to follow a path that would inevitably lead to destruction. Abdullah became a suicide bomber and was involved in an unsuccessful assassination attempt on a high-ranking Saudi Arabian official in 2009. Although the attack was not successful, it marked the beginning of an era of violence perpetrated by the al-Asiri brothers, who would continue to play key roles in AQAP. Al-Asiri's Role in Yemen and Connection to Global Terrorism Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri's involvement in terrorism is not limited to his efforts in Saudi Arabia. Believed to be currently based in Yemen, he is responsible for orchestrating several high-profile attacks, including. The 2009 Christmas Day plot, where a Nigerian man attempted to blow up a commercial jet over the United States with a bomb hidden in his underwear, was linked to al-Asiri's bomb-making capabilities. He has also been accused of masterminding the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, where bombs were hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes bound for the United States. These attacks are a testament to al-Asiri's growing influence and reach in global terrorism. Conclusion Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri's journey into the world of terrorism is an important lesson on the dangers of radicalization and the threat that figures like al-Asiri pose to international security. As his reach continues to expand, so too does the need for intelligence agencies to keep a close eye on al-Asiri and others like him. In conclusion, understanding the story of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri offers a glimpse into the vast, intricate web of modern terrorism. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of staying vigilant against extremist ideologies and ensuring that we, as a global society, work together to tackle the scourge of terror both at home and abroad."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence.

Article:","response":"Title: Confessed Killer at Colorado Planned Parenthood Clinic Proclaims Himself a \\"Warrior for the Babies\\" Introduction: In a recent court hearing, the man accused of killing three people and severely injuring nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs has openly declared his guilt. Not only did he confess to the heinous crime, but he also proceeded to proclaim himself as a \\"warrior for the babies\\", causing nationwide outrage and concern. Background of the incident: The incident took place in November 2015, when a man identified as Robert Lewis Dear Jr. opened fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. The attack lasted for several hours and resulted in the loss of three innocent lives, including a police officer, and left nine others seriously injured. It was one of the most violent attacks on the healthcare provider in recent history, and the motive behind the shooting was immediately linked to Dear's anti-abortion stances. The court hearing and confession: During the court hearing earlier this week, Dear appeared to be unapologetic about his crimes. In a shocking confession, he openly admitted his guilt and justified his actions as being necessary to protect the lives of unborn children. He declared himself as, “a warrior for the babies,” representing his strong opposition to abortion and commitment to fight against it. This statement caused a wave of disbelief and shock among the people present in the court, and has since generated conversations on social media and news outlets. Public reaction and concerns: The bold proclamation made by Dear during his trial has sparked a nationwide debate over the divisive issue of abortion rights. While some people empathize with his anti-abortion beliefs, the majority condemns his criminal actions as a misguided and dangerous attempt to force his ideologies on others. Mental health experts have also weighed in, suggesting that Dear's statements might indicate an unstable mental state, which raises concerns about the role mental health plays in such incidents. Implications for Planned Parenthood and the pro-life movement: The aftermath of the attack, as well as the heated discussions spurred by Dear's courtroom confession, has led to increased scrutiny of Planned Parenthood and their practices. While the healthcare provider has reiterated their commitment to legal and safe abortion services, they continue to face opposition from pro-life advocates. At the same time, the pro-life movement has taken an opportunity to distance itself from Dear's actions, asserting that violence has no place in their efforts to protect the unborn. Conclusion: The shocking confession and contentious statements made by Robert Lewis Dear Jr. during his court hearing have ignited discussions on the volatile issue of abortion rights in America. While his actions have been widely condemned, the case highlights the persistent gaps in understanding and dialogue that exist between the two sides of the debate. As the legal proceedings continue, the focus must remain on ensuring justice for the victims and their families."},{"question":"Answer based on context: Riding high from their win over Pittsburgh, the Chargers traveled up north to Candlestick Park for a Week 6 fight with their other state rival, the San Francisco 49ers.

He has a broken leg and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman (Caroline Dhavernas) finding him. He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's license that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Plazzy.

In recent years, the use of social media platforms has significantly increased, becoming an integral part of daily life, particularly for adolescents. With the widespread accessibility of smartphones and the internet, social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok have attracted millions of users, providing them with various means of communication, self-expression, and entertainment. This rise in social media usage has led to concerns about its potential impacts on the mental health of young individuals. Adolescence is a critical period characterized by significant physical, cognitive, and emotional development, making it important to examine how social media might influence this vulnerable age group. Hypothesis: Increased use of social media is associated with a higher incidence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem among adolescents. To test this hypothesis, a study could be conducted investigating the relationship between the time spent on social media platforms and the mental well-being of adolescents. The study would involve a diverse sample of participants, encompassing various demographics, to ensure the findings are generalizable. Data would be collected through self-report questionnaires or digital monitoring, facilitated by obtaining consent from both the adolescents and their legal guardians. The participants would be asked to provide information on the amount of time they spend on different social media platforms, the type of content they interact with, and the motivation behind their usage. Additionally, standardized psychological assessment tools would be used to evaluate the participants' mental health, focusing on aspects such as depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and overall life satisfaction. Upon the completion of data collection, a thorough analysis would be carried out to explore any patterns or correlations between social media usage and mental health indicators. Relevant variables to be considered may include age, gender, socioeconomic status, and presence of any pre-existing mental health conditions. Through this analysis, it would be possible to determine whether increased usage of social media corresponds to a higher incidence of mental health issues in adolescents. If the hypothesis is supported, this would signify a need for increased awareness and intervention efforts to mitigate the potential negative consequences of excessive social media use on adolescent mental health. Possible strategies could involve implementing educational programs in schools to teach students about responsible social media habits, promoting open dialogue between adolescents and their parents or guardians, and encouraging the development of healthy coping strategies for stress and emotional challenges. On a broader scale, collaboration with social media platforms themselves could result in the design and implementation of features that support mental well-being, such as usage monitoring and content moderation focused on promoting positive interactions and avoiding harmful content."},{"question":"As of 2012, renewable energy plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for renewable energy technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Joyce","response":"Title: \\"Keys to Sanity\\" Step 1: Introduce the Protagonist and Setting The movie is primarily set in a small town. Our protagonist, Joyce, is a single mother in her late 30s who works hard to provide for her two children, Michael (aged 11) and Linda (aged 7). Joyce and her children live in a humble and friendly neighborhood, where everyone knows each other, and neighbours look out for one another. Step 2: Inciting Incident One morning, Joyce tries to open her front door as she normally would, but she discovers that it is locked from the inside. Frustrated and confused, she uses the spare key to get into her own home. Joyce is perplexed by this, as neither her children nor herself locked it. Step 3: Developing the Mystery & Introduce Supporting Characters Over the next few days, the mysterious door-locking incidents continue, becoming increasingly frequent. Joyce becomes determined to find out who or what is responsible. She enlists the help of her neighbour, Carl, a retired police officer, and Susan, the tech-savvy postgraduate student living across the street. Step 4: Investigative Adventures Joyce, Carl, and Susan band together to investigate the mysterious occurrences through a series of surveillance methods, studying their neighbourhood and potential suspects. They also uncover a possible motive by delving into the history and relationship dynamics of the neighbourhood. Step 5: Deepening the Plot & Subplots During their investigation, personal conflicts arise between the characters. Carl struggles with his life post-retirement and starts to realize he still longs for his days on the force, while Susan faces doubts over the sacrifices she's making for her dreams. Amidst the unfolding mystery, Joyce finds her bond with her children becoming stronger. There are tender moments where she teaches Michael and Linda the importance of standing up for what is right and facing one's fears. Step 6: Climax While reviewing the surveillance footage, Joyce and her team gather enough evidence to pinpoint the culprit: a teenage boy from the neighbourhood named Tommy. Living in an abusive household, he suffers from kleptomania and picked up lock-picking skills as a means to control something in his chaotic life. Step 7: Resolution Joyce confronts Tommy and, instead of pressing charges, helps him find support and a better life situation. As the town becomes aware of the mystery's resolution, bonds in the community strengthen; residents learn to better empathize with and support one another. Step 8: Denouement The movie concludes with Joyce, her children, Carl, and Susan becoming closer friends, each having grown and learned through their shared adventure. The door-lock mystery may have been solved, but the relationships and resilience developed throughout the movie will carry on. In \\"Keys to Sanity,\\" we follow Joyce as she uncovers the truth behind the locked doors and teaches her children, friends, and neighbours about empathy, understanding, and the strength of community."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The process described above encompasses the general mechanism of nuclear decay, specifically alpha and beta decay. In alpha decay, an unstable atom releases two protons and two neutrons in a cluster known as an alpha particle. On the other hand, beta decay entails a neutron within an unstable atom changing into a proton and an electron, where the proton remains in the nucleus, and the electron is released as a beta particle. Now, let us analyze the perturbation hypothesis, which is based on the assumption that more atoms split, and the effect it might have on the release of fewer neutrons from the atom. To begin with, it is essential to understand that radioactive decay is a random process. The decay of a single atom cannot influence the decay of another atom, as they are independent events. So, if the splitting of more atoms occurs, it means there is an increase in the overall decay rate of the given material. Considering alpha decay, the fact that an atom splits and releases an alpha particle (comprising two protons and two neutrons) remains constant. This process will not change regardless of how many atoms split within the material. As a result, the number of released neutrons will still be directly proportional to the number of alpha decays. In the case of beta decay, the perturbation hypothesis may seem to have an effect at first glance, as it might appear to indirectly influence the number of neutrons released during this decay process. However, beta decay results in a neutron turning into a proton and an electron, without directly releasing any additional neutrons. As a consequence, increasing the number of splitting atoms would not alter the fact that no additional neutrons are released during beta decay. Therefore, the effect of the supposed perturbation does not directly or indirectly influence the process of neutron releases during alpha and beta decays. The hypothesis itself does not lead to less neutron release from the atom. When discussing the process of increased nuclear decay, it is crucial to take into account the types of decay at play; since alpha decay releases neutrons and beta decay does not, combining both decay processes and evaluating their cumulative influence on neutron release can be complex. However, the perturbation hypothesis, in isolation, does not show a direct impact on the release of neutrons during the nuclear decay process."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Which country had more of an impact on the carbon cycle? Answer:","response":"India's decision to primarily use fossil fuels for electricity generation and Nepal's choice to rely on renewable energy sources, specifically hydro power, would have different impacts on the carbon cycle. To analyze the impacts, it is crucial to understand the carbon cycle, the energy mix of both countries, and the environmental consequences of their respective choices. The carbon cycle is the natural circulation of carbon through the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, soil, living organisms, and geological formations. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have disrupted the natural balance of the carbon cycle by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere at an accelerated rate. This accumulation of CO2 contributes to climate change, causing global warming and other environmental consequences. India, as a rapidly growing economy with an increasing energy demand, has based much of its power generation on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are major contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly CO2, which is released in large quantities when they are burned. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's primary energy demand is expected to double by 2040, with coal continuing to make up the largest part of their energy mix. In 2019, coal accounted for about 55% of India's energy supply, which contributes to air pollution and health issues in the country, in addition to exacerbating climate change. On the other hand, Nepal has opted for hydro power, which is a clean and renewable energy source. Hydro power harnesses the energy generated by moving water, either through rivers or rainfall, to produce electricity without releasing any GHG emissions. It is worth noting that environmental impacts can still occur from hydro power plants, such as habitat disruption, but these are usually not on the same scale as those associated with the production and combustion of fossil fuels. Nepal has significant hydro power potential due to its abundant water resources in the form of the Himalayan rivers and large rainfall amounts. Considering the differences in energy choices, it is clear that India's reliance on fossil fuels has a more significant impact on the carbon cycle, as this contributes to higher CO2 emissions and consequently, climate change. However, it is important to acknowledge that India has been taking steps to increase its renewable energy capacity, through initiatives like the National Solar Mission and wind energy projects. In contrast, Nepal's choice to primarily use hydro power for electricity generation significantly reduces their contribution to carbon emissions and impact on the carbon cycle. Nonetheless, both countries' actions should be evaluated within the broader context of global climate change, as well as their respective socio-economic situations and capacity to transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Managing and maintenance of plant and mashinery total costs DKK 1000","response":"Managing and maintenance of plant and machinery: total costs DKK 1,000.

One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said.

Natalie liked gardening better than Rachel liked it because Possible answers: A). Natalie hated dealing with the plants.. B). Rachel hated dealing with the plants..","response":"Natalie liked gardening better than Rachel liked it because, unlike Rachel, Natalie found gardening to be an extremely enjoyable and therapeutic hobby. Gardening allowed Natalie to escape from her daily life and become one with nature, developing an appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the various plants she cared for. Natalie loved the feeling of pride she received when she was able to successfully grow a plant from a tiny seedling or bring a potted plant back to life. These moments gave her a strong sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. On the other hand, Rachel found gardening to be more of a chore, thus leading to the conclusion of option B, Rachel hated dealing with the plants. Gardening tasks such as weeding, pruning, and watering felt like endless monotonous duties to her, rather than an enjoyable pastime. Additionally, Rachel might have been allergic to some of the plant species she encountered in the garden, leading to discomfort and irritation that only increased her dislike for gardening. The physical nature of the work, such as bending over for extended periods, digging holes, and the occasional lifting of heavy bags of soil or large pots might have caused her to feel fatigued and even physically strained after each gardening session. This further contributed to her negative attitude towards the activity. Moreover, Natalie was patient and keen on learning new gardening techniques, understanding that gardening requires a delicate balance of factors such as sunlight, water, and soil quality. She took the time to do research, speak to experienced gardeners, and attend workshops to improve her skills and knowledge. This dedication allowed her to excel in her gardening endeavors and enjoy the process even more. In contrast, Rachel was not willing to invest the same amount of time and effort into learning about gardening, which only made her dislike it even more. Whenever she encountered challenges during her gardening attempts, such as issues with plant diseases or pest infestations, she grew frustrated and disheartened, seeing these obstacles as yet another confirmation that gardening was not a hobby suited for her. In conclusion, while both Natalie and Rachel had exposure to gardening, their individual perspectives and experiences shaped their feelings towards it. Natalie loved gardening because it brought her joy, satisfaction, and opportunities for growth and learning, while Rachel disliked gardening because she felt it was more of a laborious task filled with challenges and obstacles that she was not willing to overcome."},{"question":"Why the SpaceX hype when the more commercially successful Arianespace had been launching rockets with larger payloads for over 30 years? What is the difference between BH and MH curves in magnetism? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPTIONS: +no; +yes;","response":"First, let's address the SpaceX hype compared to Arianespace. There is a significant amount of hype surrounding SpaceX, even though Arianespace has been launching rockets with larger payloads for over 30 years. The hype surrounding SpaceX is due to a variety of factors: 1. Innovation: SpaceX is known for its ambitious and innovative approach towards space exploration. This includes the development of reusable rockets, which has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of space travel. Arianespace, while commercially successful, has not yet focused as heavily on reusability. 2. Private Enterprise: While both companies are largely privately funded, SpaceX is primarily a privately-owned company, whereas Arianespace comprises multiple European aerospace companies and government support. There tends to be more interest and fascination with private companies, particularly when they undertake groundbreaking work. 3. Media Attention: Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is an influential figure in the tech world who attracts substantial media attention. Musk's involvement in other cutting-edge projects like Tesla, Neuralink, and Hyperloop adds to the overall hype around his SpaceX ventures. 4. Mars Mission: SpaceX is closely associated with an ambitious goal: the colonization of Mars. This long-term vision has captured the public's imagination as a leap forward in space exploration. Arianespace, though commercially successful, is not as explicitly focused on this grand objective. 5. Rapid Advancements: SpaceX has shown rapid advancements in rocket development, which generates excitement and anticipation for future accomplishments. In comparison, Arianespace, while successful, follows a more traditional and conservative trajectory. Now, let's discuss the difference between BH and MH curves in magnetism. BH and MH curves are graphical representations of the magnetic properties of different materials, and they are important for understanding their behavior and applications in various industries. BH Curve: The BH curve, also known as the B-H loop or hysteresis curve, depicts the relationship between the magnetic field strength (H) and the magnetic flux density (B) in a magnetic material when subjected to an external magnetic field. The BH curve is useful in determining magnetic properties like coercivity, remanence, and energy loss in the form of hysteresis for ferromagnetic materials. MH Curve: The MH curve, also called a magnetization curve, shows the relationship between the applied magnetic field strength (H) and the magnetization (M) of a magnetic material. The magnetization is the magnetic response of the material which results from the alignment of its atomic magnetic dipoles. The MH curve indicates the susceptibility of the material to magnetization and helps to predict its behavior in different magnetic field strengths. In summary, the BH curve is used to analyze the hysteresis effects and energy losses in magnetic materials when subjected to an external magnetic field, while the MH curve is used to understand how magnetic materials respond to applied magnetic fields in terms of their magnetization. Lastly, to answer the multi-choice problem: These two questions are inquiring about different information. Therefore, the answer is: +no;"},{"question":"Here are some concepts: giraffe, photo, pose, zoo What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"Step 1: Identify the concepts - giraffe, photo, pose, zoo Step 2: Think about how these concepts can be connected in a sentence.

He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

A:","response":"Philip K. Dick was an American science fiction writer known for his influential and innovative work in the genre. Born on December 16, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, Dick's writing career spanned four decades, during which he wrote 44 novels and more than 120 short stories. Many of his works explored themes of political authority, altered states of consciousness, paranoia, and the nature of reality. His influential novels include \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" (1968), which served as the basis for the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" (1982); \\"Ubik\\" (1969), which delves into the nature of reality; \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" (1962), an alternate history story in which the Axis powers won World War II, and \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" (1977), which explores the effects of drug use on both individuals and society. Dick's writing was notable for its realistic portrayal of everyday life in future dystopian settings, as well as its exploration of philosophical and existential questions about the nature of humanity and reality. Throughout his life, Dick struggled with personal issues, including mental health problems and drug abuse. His twin sister Jane's death shortly after their birth had a profound impact on him, which manifested in various ways in his writing. Despite his personal struggles, Dick left a lasting legacy within the science fiction genre, and his work continues to inspire new generations of authors and filmmakers.

They said eight missiles were launched by two unmanned drone planes targeting vehicles. The strikes are believed to have been undertaken by the United States, which has been conducting drone strikes in the fight against terrorism. There was no immediate comment about the attack from the United States. Offensives by the nation's army and drone attacks by the United States have reduced the terror organization's effectiveness in recent years.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose much limestone has formed happens, how will it affect less rain hits the limestone. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"In the described process, the formation of caves relies heavily on the interaction between rain and limestone. The acidic reaction caused by rain leads to the disintegration of limestone, eventually resulting in the formation of caves. The perturbation hypothesis you provided suggests that there is an increase in the amount of limestone but a decrease in the amount of rain hitting the limestone. This scenario would have both direct and indirect effects on the cave formation process. Direct effects: 1. Reduced rate of cave formation: With less rain interacting with the limestone, the rate at which limestone disintegrates will be significantly reduced. As a result, cave formation will occur more slowly or possibly not at all if the rain is insufficient to initiate the acidic reaction. 2. Smaller caves: If the decrease in rain is not severe enough to halt the cave formation process entirely, it is still likely that the overall size of the caves formed would be smaller. This is because the reduced rate of limestone disintegration would lead to less substantial gaps forming where the limestone once was. Indirect effects: 1. Influence on local ecosystems: The altered rate of cave formation could impact local ecosystems that rely on caves as habitats or resources. For example, certain species of bats, insects, and other cave-dwelling organisms could experience changes in their populations due to the decreased availability of cave habitats. 2. Impact on groundwater flow: Limestone, as a porous rock, plays a vital role in the flow and storage of groundwater. A change in the cave formation rate may also affect how groundwater travels through the area. In summary, the proposed perturbation of increased limestone formation and decreased rain interactions would directly affect the cave formation process by altering the rate of limestone disintegration and the size of resulting caves. Indirectly, the changes could also have implications for local ecosystems and groundwater flow."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: By. Mail On Sunday Reporter.

Make this proper case.","response":"Slower logging and more sustainable forestry practices are indeed good news, considering the numerous benefits that forests can provide to both nature and people. These benefits extend to ecological, economic, and social aspects, highlighting the importance of maintaining healthy forests for present and future generations. Ecologically, forests play a critical role in the global environment. They act as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, forests are home to a vast array of flora and fauna, making them some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Protecting these habitats ensures the survival of countless species of plants and animals, many of which have yet to be discovered. Moreover, forests maintain water cycles, purify air and water, and prevent soil erosion, all of which contribute to a healthier and more stable environment. Economically, forests provide a wide array of resources for human use. This includes timber and non-timber forest products, such as food, medicine, and materials for various industries. Moreover, forests generate employment opportunities in the forestry sector, which encompasses logging, resource management, and tourism. Sustainable forestry practices, such as selective logging and agroforestry, can help ensure that this economic potential is maintained while minimizing the negative impacts on the environment and forest ecosystems. Socially, forests play an essential role in the lives of many communities, particularly indigenous peoples who have lived in and around forests for generations. These communities often rely on forests for their livelihoods, food security, and cultural practices. Sustainable forestry can help preserve these unique cultural connections while also benefiting the communities through employment opportunities and income generation. Promoting slower logging rates and more sustainable forestry practices is, therefore, a win-win situation for both nature and people. By slowing down the rate at which forests are logged, we can minimize the disruption of key ecological processes and allow forest ecosystems to recover from previous disturbances. This will ultimately lead to healthier and more resilient forests that continue to provide essential services and resources to people and the planet. In summary, the importance of slower logging and sustainable forestry practices cannot be overstated. By supporting these practices, we contribute to the preservation of the world's forests, which are critical for maintaining ecological balance, providing valuable resources, and supporting the lives and cultures of countless communities. In recognizing the significant benefits that forests bring to both nature and people, it is our responsibility to ensure their long-term survival and sustainability."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... Question: When are supplements mainly of assistance to people? Options: A. When there is a risk of cancer B. not enough information C. after the diagnosis of heart disease D. when dietary sources are inadequate A:","response":"D. when dietary sources are inadequate"},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Castro A:","response":"Title: Echoes of the Past Step 1: Setting The movie takes place in modern-day Cuba, with a backdrop of political turmoil, social unrest, and calls for change. The Cuban government is depicted as oppressive and corrupt, with its citizens longing for a better life. Step 2: Introducing the Main Characters - Manuel Castro: The protagonist, a charismatic young man and a direct descendant of Fidel Castro. He is a passionate advocate for change and the leader of the revolution against the current government. - Rosa: A young, independent woman who is a close ally of Manuel and a critical figure in the resistance movement. - General Armando: The antagonist, a high-ranking government official who is responsible for suppressing dissent and maintaining the Supreme Leader's grip on power. Step 3: Establishing the Conflict The Cuban people are fed up with human rights violations, lack of political freedom, and widespread poverty. Manuel, inspired by his family's history and the people's suffering, rises to lead a revolution against the current government. Step 4: Rising Action - Manuel forms a network of supporters and allies that rapidly grows in strength, which draws the attention of General Armando and the government. - Rosa, using her intelligence and wit, helps Manuel orchestrate a series of guerilla attacks against the government's forces to weaken their resolve. - The revolution gains momentum, inspiring more people to stand up against the oppressive regime. Step 5: Climax The revolutionaries, led by Manuel and Rosa, organize a massive protest in Havana, demanding the Supreme Leader's resignation. The government dispatches its forces under General Armando's command to crush the protest, leading to a violent and dramatic showdown on the streets of the capital. Step 6: Resolution Manuel and Rosa's forces ultimately prevail, capturing General Armando and demanding that the Supreme Leader step down. Their persistence and valor in standing up to the government inspire the Cuban people to rally behind them and embrace a new era of freedom, fairness, and democracy. Step 7: Final Scene As a new democratic government takes shape under Manuel's guidance, he visits Fidel Castro's tomb to reflect on his family's legacy and the responsibility he carries as a leader of change. With the Cuban people's hopes and dreams on his shoulders, Manuel vows to build a better future for his country. In summary, \\"Echoes of the Past\\" is a story of bravery, resilience, and hope inspired by modern-day criticism of the Cuban government.

See how close they are to you and whether there are any obstacles, like desks or chairs, that might slow you down if you have to get to the door quickly. This seems easy, since you walk through your classroom doors almost every day, but reviewing their location will help it become second nature and make it easier to remember in an emergency. If you can evacuate safely, this is often considered the best option for getting away from a school shooting. However, each scenario is different. If you know you can’t run away safely, stay in place and hide. Estimate how far off the ground the windows are to see if you could jump out of them safely in case of an emergency. Watch how your teacher opens and closes the windows, and volunteer to help them to see how it’s done. You could even stay behind a few minutes after class to practice opening and closing the windows quickly. Ask your teacher first, explaining to them that you want to be as prepared as possible in case of an emergency. Escaping through the windows especially good option if your classroom has windows that face the outside and you know, as well as you can, that the shooter is inside. When you get a free moment in class, challenge yourself to think of the quickest route off campus from your current location. Figure this out for each of your classes so you can be prepared just in case you need to make a quick getaway. Do the same thing for anywhere else that you spend a lot of time on campus, such as the cafeteria, gym, or sports fields. Challenge yourself to take different routes to class and to explore areas of campus that you’re not as familiar with. Find the fastest way out from every area on campus, as well as alternate routes in case some ways are blocked off or inaccessible. Look around campus after school or during lunch when you’re allowed to be out and about. In the unlikely event of a shooting threat, your in-depth knowledge of your school can help you make a quick getaway. Once you’ve set up your own mental evacuation routes, go over them in your head every few days to keep them fresh. Your goal is to turn these routes into an instinct, so that you know how to evacuate in case it ever becomes necessary. Your school probably has its own evacuation routes in place for the unlikely event of a shooting. If you haven’t already learned these routes through drills, you can ask a teacher or administrator what they are. Remember that in a school shooting situation, you likely won’t be on your own. You can follow the lead of teachers and other adults who are trained to take care of you in these situations. If you somehow do find yourself separated from the group, your own evacuation preparation is your backup. You can use what you know to make a safe escape. Summary:","response":"To prepare for emergencies such as school shootings, familiarize yourself with all exits in classrooms and other areas on campus. Regularly review their locations to make it second nature. Consider window accessibility and outdoor access points as well. Develop mental evacuation routes and practice them often, turning them into instinct. Learn the school's official evacuation routes and follow the guidance of teachers and administrators during an emergency.

The personality is a 10-year old who loves ham and cheese sandwiches, enjoys watching TV, loves orange juice, and is named Arnold. The conversation revolves around the topic of food and meal preparation, and shows preferences and admiration for home cooked meals by his mother. The reply should ideally align with this context. We can eliminate candidate 2: 'Good where do you work' because the nature of the conversation doesn't currently involve career or work context - Arnold is a 10-year old child. Similarly, candidate 4: 'Do you have any hobbies?' is also irrelevant in the ongoing discussion about meals and food. Candidate 3: 'Nice, that takes me back to when I was a kid' could be ruled out because Arnold is still a 10-year-old child. This leaves us with candidate 1: 'I hope I can do that when I grow up, after I am a fireman', which aligns with the context of the conversation (it's about making meals) and is suitable from a 10-year-old's perspective.

Tom Marino across the House floor, taking offense at comments by the Pennsylvania Republican during debate on the border funding bill Friday night. “We don’t have law and order,” Marino began as he wrapped up his comments on the border supplemental. “My colleagues on the other side don’t want to do anything about it.” “You know something that I find quite interesting about the other side? Under the leadership of the former Speaker [Pelosi], and under the leadership of their former leader [Rep. Steny Hoyer], when in 2009 and 2010, they had the House, the Senate and the White House, and they knew this problem existed,” he continued. “They didn’t have the strength to go after it back then. But now are trying to make a political issue out of it now.” Off-mic, Pelosi then approached Marino, crossing the aisle in view of cameras, and apparently challenged Marino’s assertion that Democrats did not do anything about the issue when they had majority control. “Yes it is true,” Marino replied directly to Pelosi, who was House speaker in those years. “I did the research on it. You might want to try it. You might want to try it, Madam Leader. Do the research on it. Do the research. I did it. That’s one thing that you don’t do.” Marino then urged lawmakers to support the border supplemental “because apparently I hit the right nerve.” After Marino concluded his remarks and as many Republicans applauded their colleague, Pelosi crossed the chamber again in view of cameras, enraged, pointing and sticking her finger at Marino. She then followed Marino up a Republican aisle, gesturing and arguing with him. Lawmakers on the GOP side gathered in dismay as one spoke out to tell the chair that the House was not in order, in an effort to halt the bickering. Pelosi finally relented after Republicans tried to get between Pelosi and Marino, and she returned to the Democratic side of the chamber. The House then promptly voted to approve the 694 million border supplemental, 223-189. *UPDATE: According to Pelosi spokeswoman Evangeline George, “Leader Pelosi just wanted to remind the Congressman that House Democrats had the courage to pass the DREAM Act – and have the courage to stand up for what the American people want: bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.” George added that “Pelosi accepted the Congressman’s apology.” But Marino’s chief of staff, Bill Tighe, stressed that Marino did not apologize to Pelosi, and will not apologize. “[Rep. Marino] did not apologize to Leader Pelosi and does not intend to do so as he has nothing to apologize for. She was entirely out of line in approaching him while he was recognized and delivering remarks on the Floor,” Tighe wrote in an email. “Her staff’s comment in your story about her accepting his apology in simply not true.” Later, Marino took to Twitter to explain his side of the story. Rep. Pelosi called me an 'insignificant person' on the Floor of the House. I'll ponder that for a while driving to Williamsport tonight… — Rep. Tom Marino (@RepTomMarino) August 2, 2014 …of course I'll be driving myself, with no staff or security. And I'm just a country lawyer who worked in a bakery until he was 30… — Rep.

If you've read up on scd and believe it could provide you some relief from your symptoms, get advice from your doctor on whether scd is right for you. Scd primarily works by starving bacteria in your intestines.","response":"By restricting the intake of complex carbohydrates, it effectively eliminates the fuel source for bad bacteria and yeast, thus promoting a healthy gut flora balance and reducing inflammation. Before embarking on the SCD, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the diet's principles and the types of foods allowed and forbidden. Also, be aware that this dietary change may initially cause some discomfort or adverse effects, such as the \\"die-off\\" phenomenon – the reaction experienced when toxic byproducts are released from dying bacteria and yeast. In order to follow the SCD effectively, you will need to adhere to these guidelines: 1. Eliminate all grains, sugars, and starchy vegetables: Contrary to most traditional diets, the SCD disallows all grain-based foods, not just gluten-containing ones. This includes rice, corn, wheat, quinoa, and legumes, such as beans and lentils. Additionally, you must eliminate all added sugars and natural sugars, like honey. Be cautious of hidden sugars in processed foods. Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes and yams, must also be omitted. 2. Consume only specific carbohydrates: Fruits, non-starchy vegetables, and unprocessed fats and proteins are the primary sources of carbohydrates in the SCD. Unsweetened yogurt made from SCD-legal ingredients, which is fermented for at least 24 hours, is also a staple on the diet. It must be ensured that all foods consumed do not contain additives, fillers, or preservatives, as these could be hidden sources of illegal carbohydrates. 3. Monitor your dairy intake: While dairy is not explicitly forbidden on the SCD, some people may have intolerances or sensitivities to lactose or casein, leading to further inflammation. Experiment with limiting or eliminating lactose and casein to observe any improvements in your condition. If tolerated, consume SCD-legal dairy products, such as aged cheeses and homemade yogurt, sparingly. 4. Gradually phase in more complex foods: The SCD begins with a strict introductory phase, during which only minimal carbohydrates and easily digestible foods are consumed. As your gut heals and symptoms improve, slowly add in more complex carbohydrates, as recommended by the diet. Monitor your responses to these additions and adjust your food choices accordingly. 5. Prioritize homemade meals and snacks: While it is sometimes possible to find SCD-legal products in stores, it's best to prepare your meals and snacks at home to ensure complete dietary compliance. Stock up on allowed ingredients and arm yourself with an SCD cookbook or online resources for recipe inspiration. 6. Seek support and mentorship: Making significant dietary changes can be challenging, especially when it involves a restrictive regimen like the SCD. Find local or online SCD support groups to share experiences, recipes, and advice from others who have successfully adopted and benefited from the diet. 7. Monitor symptoms and progress: Keep a food journal to track your meals and any changes in your symptoms. Use this information to fine-tune your diet and determine which foods may be triggering flare-ups, and which are soothing your gut. Regular check-ins with your doctor should also be scheduled to evaluate your progress and make necessary adjustments. 8. Be patient: The process of healing the gut is not instantaneous. The specific carbohydrate diet is meant to be followed long-term in order to see significant, lasting results. Remain dedicated and patient, as the time it takes to heal will vary from person to person. Remember, the Specific Carbohydrate Diet can be a powerful tool for alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms and promoting gut health, but it's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to determine if it's the right fit for you. They can provide guidance, answer questions, and help you navigate any challenges that may arise during your journey to better gut health."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Willingness-to-pay is a concept used in economics to assess the value that individuals place on a good or service, such as improved visibility resulting from air quality regulations like the Clear Skies Act.

What he did to her was called \\"rape,\\" and it made the little girl very sad and scared. But this little girl was very strong and determined. She knew what the bad man did was wrong, and she wanted to make sure he couldn't hurt other little girls like her. So, she went to a big room where people decide what happens to bad people. This big room is called a courtroom and it's in a big city called Kabul. In the courtroom, the brave little girl looked straight in the eyes of the bad cleric man and told everyone what he did to her. This was a very hard thing to do, but she knew she had to do it. There were other people in the room too—like the judge, who's like the teacher of the courtroom, and some other grown-up heroes called women's rights activists. They wanted to make things right for the little girl and other girls everywhere. The judge listened carefully to the brave little girl and decided that the bad cleric man must be punished for what he did. So, he told the bad man that he had to go to a place called prison for 20 whole years! That's a very long time—longer than the little girl had even been alive! The women's rights activists were very happy with the judge's decision. They clapped and cheered for the brave little girl and said she was an inspiration to girls everywhere.

Though the two sentences have different structures and word order, the primary intent or the core idea behind both sentences remains the same. Here is a more detailed explanation as to how both sentences convey the same idea but use different phrasing: 1. The music was composed by Vedha and the lyrics by Kannadasan were written. - In this sentence, the first part, \\"The music was composed by Vedha,\\" clearly indicates that Vedha composed the music. - The second part, \\"the lyrics by Kannadasan were written,\\" rearranges the words to convey that Kannadasan wrote the lyrics. 2.

La \\"biodiversidad\\" se refiere a la variedad de vida en la Tierra, tanto entre las especies como dentro de ellas. Es un componente esencial para la salud y estabilidad de los ecosistemas en los que las especies viven y coexisten. La biodiversidad también es fundamental para la provisión de recursos naturales y servicios ecosistémicos que sostienen nuestras vidas, como la producción de alimentos, la purificación del agua y el aire, así como la prevención y control de plagas y enfermedades. La \\"contaminación ambiental\\" es la introducción de sustancias contaminantes o la alteración de las condiciones naturales del entorno, lo que puede tener efectos nocivos en las poblaciones humanas y los ecosistemas. Hay muchos tipos de contaminación, como la contaminación del agua, del aire, del suelo y la lumínica. Algunas de las principales fuentes de contaminación son las actividades industriales, los vehículos de motor y la agricultura intensiva. La contaminación afecta no sólo a los seres humanos y su salud, sino también a las plantas, los animales y los ecosistemas en su conjunto. La \\"destrucción del hábitat natural\\" es un proceso en el que un entorno natural, como un bosque, una pradera o un humedal, se convierte en un espacio no apto para albergar la vida silvestre que solía vivir allí. Esto puede ocurrir debido a la tala de árboles, la conversión de la tierra para la agricultura, la construcción de infraestructuras o el cambio climático. La pérdida y degradación de los hábitats es una de las principales causas del declive de la biodiversidad a nivel mundial. En conclusión, la oración en español menciona dos amenazas críticas que enfrenta la biodiversidad: la contaminación ambiental y la destrucción del hábitat natural. Los esfuerzos de conservación y políticas sostenibles son esenciales para abordar estos problemas y garantizar la protección y preservación de la biodiversidad para las generaciones futuras."},{"question":"Choose your answer from: [A].

But Kiev accused the rebels of shelling the outskirts of Mariupol - a key port city - from 12km (7.4 miles) away. Meanwhile, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has visited Crimea, which Moscow annexed last year. He said it would be \\"dangerous\\" for ethnic groups to seek special status, seen as a reference to the Tatars who make up about 10% of Crimea's population and largely opposed the takeover. Mr Putin also alleged that Ukraine's government was \\"under external control, with key positions in the government and regions filled by foreign citizens\\". The former Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, has been appointed as governor of Odessa while three government ministers are foreign-born. Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko called Mr Putin's visit \\"a challenge to the civilised world\\". The latest escalation in eastern Ukraine has left the ceasefire signed in February looking more fragile than ever. Among the dead were seven civilians and two government soldiers, reports said. Kiev, Western governments and Nato say there is clear evidence of Russian regular troops helping the separatists and arming them with heavy weapons - something Moscow denies. Sartana and Lebedynske - villages on the eastern outskirts of Mariupol - came under heavy rebel fire, the Kiev authorities said. They said two Ukrainian troops and two civilians were killed by the rebel shelling. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Kiev of refusing to demilitarise Shyrokyne, a village east of Mariupol that has seen some of the heaviest fighting. \\"We're alarmed by the developments in recent days, which very strongly remind us of preparations for another round of combat operations,\\" he said. The news service of the self-styled rebel \\"Donetsk People's Republic\\" said government artillery had shelled the outskirts of Donetsk, killing two civilians, and the city of Horlivka, where three civilians died. Rebel-held Horlivka is just north of Donetsk. Under the ceasefire, signed in the Belarusian capital Minsk, both sides were supposed to pull back their heavy weapons. But they accuse each other of reneging on the agreement.

Flay, 50, and March, 40, spent New Year’s together in Amsterdam, but the Food Network chef then jetted off to LA for six weeks to film a TV show, leaving March behind. When Flay came back, a source said distance had torn them apart. “The couple grew apart, and both are very sad about the split,” we’re told. Flay has been linked to several women during their marriage, including January Jones and ­Giada De Laurentiis, though he’s denied any romantic involvement. In 2010, after Jones crashed into three parked cars in LA, she called Flay to help her deal with the situation. The chef at the time claimed he had only met Jones once before, and “she asked for his number because she wanted to redo her kitchen and gave his number to her designer.” Then, in December, Flay was spotted at dinner with petite chef De Laurentiis at Cecconi’s at Soho Beach House Miami just days before she announced her divorce. “It looked like a friendly dinner,” the source said, but added De Laurentiis “definitely had a few drinks.” Flay explained the outing to us as “two colleagues and old friends had a quick dinner.” March, who launched makeup shop Rouge last year, told Hamptons magazine last summer that Flay’s work schedule made it hard to spend quality time together. “Bobby has sworn to me, like some sort of dating website, we would take walks on the beach, because last year, I said over and over, ‘Let’s take a walk on the beach.’ This time he says he’s going to follow through.” Their reps declined comment. ||||| Bobby Flay and Wife Stephanie March Split Snow Patrol.

I don't -- I don't know. As time has gone on things have changed since the 60's in the south.\\" Following her shocking testimony, several people have slammed the celebrity chef with the Food Network announcing that her contract won’t be renewed when it expires in June 2013 and several of her sponsors and business partners, such as Walmart and Casesar’s Entertainment, terminating their ties with her. Guy Fieri: The Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives host was dragged into a nasty custody dispute after his sister Morgan died in 2011 and her widowed husband, Dain Pape, fought her parents for their son, Jules.

Article: NOWADAYS, most animated films rely heavily on computer technology. But his magical world - where witches cast spells and castles float in the sky - is brought to life by hand. Nevertheless, Hayao Miyazaki is referred to as Japan's Walt Disney and considered by many to be the world's greatest living animator. This month, the 72-year-old Miyazaki announced his retirement. The Japanese animator has directed 11 animated full-length films over the past four decades, including the Oscar-winning Spirited Away (<<>> ) and his latest release, The Wind Rises (<<>> ), which tells the life story of a man who designed Japanese World War II fighter planes. Just as The Wind Rises shows, Miyazaki is well-known for his obsession with flight, especially human flight. Other striking aspects of Miyazaki's films include his themes of environmental protection and the horrors of war. Miyazaki's work is also famous for its lack of clearly defined good and evil characters. He sees the 21st century as a complex time when old norms need to be re-examined. As a storyteller, he is an inventor of fairy tales full of mystery. In the Miyazakian universe, wizards turn into birds of prey; young girls are transformed overnight into 90-year-old women; greedy parents are changed into pigs; and shooting stars become fire demons . As a visual artist, most of Miyazaki's grace comes from his vivid colors and lovingly drawn landscapes - a rolling meadow covered with flowers and shadowed by clouds, or a range of rocky hills rising toward snow-capped mountain peaks People attribute Miyazaki's success to his long pursuit of his hand-drawn technique, although in an interview with CNN he called himself an \\"extinct species\\" in the age of digital animation.

The arena opened its doors in 1959 and served as the primary indoor event venue for the city for many years. 3. Over the years, the arena has hosted numerous sporting events, concerts, and other activities. It has been home to a variety of sports teams, including basketball teams. One notable basketball team that played in the arena was the LA Lakers (1960-1967) before they moved to The Forum and then later on to the Staples Center. 4. The sports arena also hosted USC Trojans men's basketball team from 1959 to 2006, and from 2011 to 2012, along with basketball games during the 1984 Summer Olympics. 5. However, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena closed its doors in 2016 and was demolished later that year. 6. In its place, the Banc of California Stadium was built, which opened in 2018.

The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks in guest roles. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. For inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff referenced a poster featuring more than 320 Simpsons characters. Groening said they tried to include every single character in the film, with 98 having speaking parts, and most members of the crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people. The series' regular voice actors: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer, as well as semi-regular performers Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor, and Karl Wiedergott, reprised their roles. Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, while Albert Brooks, who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was hired as Russ Cargill, after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film. For \\"about a week\\", he was to reprise the role of Hank Scorpio, but when the character was omitted from the film, he ended up voicing Cargill. The cast did the first of three table readings in May 2005, and began recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production. James L. Brooks directed them for the first time since the television show's early seasons. Castellaneta found the recording sessions \\"more intense\\" than recording the television series, and \\"more emotionally dramatic\\". Some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving the voice cast exhausted. The writers had written the opening concert scene without a specific band in mind. Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call. Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides the voice of the father in the \\"new Grand Canyon\\" commercial with Hanks. Due to time restraints, several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film. Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut. Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt the voice was too distracting, so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice. Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos, but their scenes were cut. Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points, but these scenes were also cut. Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star. Although he does not provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States rather than then-President George W. Bush because, according to Groening, \\"in two years ... the film [would be] out of date\\". Brooks was nervous about the idea, noting that \\"[Schwarzenegger's] opinion polls were way down\\", and has said that they \\"were [hoping] he'd make a political comeback\\". The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger, but one of the staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainer Wolfcastle as President. This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle, himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger, being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle. were there other famous voices that are not on the regular show?","response":"Yes, there were other famous voices apart from the regular cast. Some of them include Tom Hanks, Green Day, and Albert Brooks in guest roles."},{"question":"You are given a new situation: John is a doctor with the local hospital. Earlier today, he was seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John found out that patient A had more LDL, but patient B had more HDL. He now needs to determine correct treatment for them. and a hint : Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.

Title: Pretty Bad Review: One of the most over-the-top, not to mention completely unrealistic action movies I have ever seen. Meh. At least the leading lady is gorgeous. Answer:","response":"After closely examining and analyzing the given customer review, it appears that the customer is dissatisfied with the product, in this case, an action movie. The following elements provide evidence to support this conclusion: 1. Title: The title of the review is \\"Pretty Bad,\\" which indicates a negative perception of the movie. This title already gives a clear idea that the customer did not enjoy or appreciate the movie. 2. Over-the-top: The customer describes the movie as \\"over-the-top,\\" often used to describe a situation where things are exaggerated, excessive, or beyond a reasonable limit. This opinion indicates that the action and scenarios presented in the movie were deemed unrealistic or difficult to believe by the customer, which likely detracted from their overall enjoyment. 3. Completely unrealistic: The customer explicitly mentions that the movie is \\"completely unrealistic,\\" reinforcing the notion that the action scenes and plot did not meet the customer's expectations of plausibility. This further highlights their dissatisfaction with the product. 4. Meh: The customer used the term \\"meh\\" to express their indifference, which implies that the movie did not make a positive impression on them. This term is commonly used when someone feels unimpressed or apathetic towards a subject matter. In this case, it indicates the customer's negative or lukewarm response to the movie. 5. Leading lady comment: The customer's sole positive comment about the movie is regarding the appearance of the leading lady. This highlights that the customer may have found it challenging to derive any other positive or enjoyable aspects from the movie. In summary, based on the various elements and overall tone of the review, it can be concluded that the customer was dissatisfied with the action movie. The negative impressions provided by the over-the-top and unrealistic elements, combined with an overall indifferent attitude, are clear indicators that the customer did not have a satisfying experience with the product."},{"question":"Former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made it very clear during an appearance earlier this week that she is no fan of Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists and who currently is avoiding criminal charges by hiding out in Russia. The former first lady attended a discussion at the University of Connecticut on Wednesday and was asked whether Snowden's leaks had done anything to help national security, or the discourse about how far the government can go in terms of domestic intelligence gathering. Clinton said she feels that the balance between privacy and security is important, but the way Snowden went about bringing the information to light was damaging to national security and may have inadvertently helped terrorist groups. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Harm: Clinton says Snowden's leaks did nothing but harm U.S. security and help terrorists and those who with harm on America. 2016: Clinton is a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. 'I think turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or. unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained—gave all kinds of. information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist. groups and the like,' she said. She went on to say that she doesn't 'understand why he couldn't have been part of the debate at home,' before taking classified documents to other countries. Clinton went to explain how Snowden could have had a bigger impact if he had turned the information over to officials and asked for whistleblower protection. 'When he emerged and when he absconded with all that material, I was. puzzled, because we have all these protections for whistleblowers,' Clinton said. 'If he were. concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate, he could have. been. But it struck me as—I just have to be honest with you—as sort of. odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by. China, and that he would then go to Russia, two countries with which we. have very difficult cyber-relationships, to put it mildly.' Phony: Clinton mocked Snowden's question for Putin about whether Russia has any spy programs similar to ones he exposed in the US. Clinton, a former senator from New York before being appointed secretary of state, explained to the audience that having worked in the State Department and the Senate, she is much better informed about the threats that face the United States than the average citizen - many of whom look at Snowden as a hero. 'There are people right this minute trying to figure out how to do harm to Americans and to other innocent people,' Clinton said before explaining that the balance between security and privacy may have shifted towards security in the post-9/11 world, but that the NSA's intelligence gathering is what's helping to prevent another terrorist attack. After he had stolen the classified documents, Snowden went to Hong Kong, which is ruled by China, before settling in Russia. Clinton said by doing so, Snowden has essentially helped these countries - both of which have somewhat strained relations with United States - gather intelligence about U.S. security forces. 'When I would go to China or I would go to Russia,' she said, 'we would. leave all my electronic equipment on the plane with the batteries out,. because this is a new frontier and they're trying to find out not just. about what we do in our government, they're trying to find out about. what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails. of people who worked in the State Department. It's not like the only. government in the world that is doing anything is the United States.' 'I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority,' Clinton said of Snowden. Clinton also mocked Snowden's recent call-in to a supposed Q&A with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who granted Snowden temporary asylum in his country after he leaked the classified documents. During the Q&A Snowden cautiously asked the Russian president if the Russian government had spy programs similar to those of the United States. Mocking Snowden and Putin's response, Clinton condescendingly paraphrased Putin's answer, saying, 'well from one intelligence professional to another, of course not.' 'Oh, thank you so much,' she continued to mock. 'I mean really.' Clinton also took a shot at Snowden's claim that he's a passionate defender of privacy and liberty. 'I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority,' She said. Putin's government has routinely jailed those who oppose his rule, including members of the punk band Pussy Riot and longtime political opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, whom Putin had jailed for eight years. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"This article discusses former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's viewpoint on Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents. Speaking at an appearance at the University of Connecticut, Clinton expressed her belief that Snowden's actions were more harmful than beneficial to national security and potentially assisted terrorist groups. Clinton expressed her bafflement at Snowden's decision to flee to countries like China and Russia, both of which hold complex cyber-relations with the US. She questioned why Snowden didn't choose to be part of the debate at home and make use of the protective measures in place for whistleblowers. Instead, he chose to reveal the classified documents to other countries, which according to Clinton, indirectly aided these nations, having strained relationships with the US, in gaining intelligence about US security forces. Moreover, Clinton critiqued Snowden, who identifies himself as a privacy and liberty champion, for seeking refuge under Putin's rule in Russia. She called this move contradictory since Putin's government has been known to arrest those opposing his regime. Clinton also mocked Snowden's interaction with Putin during a Q&A. Snowden's inquired if Russia had spy programs similar to those in the US, to which Putin answering negatively was met with sarcasm from Clinton. Furthermore, Clinton stressed that her involvement in the State Department and Senate had given her a grasp on the threats against the US superior to that of an average citizen. She underscored that people are continuously plotting harm against Americans and other innocents. Hence, the balance between security and privacy may have tilted towards security after 9/11, but the NSA's intelligence gathering is essential in averting another terrorist attack. Lastly, Clinton, a potential Democratic presidential candidate for 2016, indicated her awareness of the new frontier, cyber warfare. During her official visits to China and Russia, her electronic equipment would be left on the plane, with the batteries removed to avoid information breach. Discussing her concern about cyber-attacks on the government and companies, she concluded by stating that the US is not the only government engaged in such activities."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. qlblqqlqqqqqb Output:","response":"In this task, you are given a string and your goal is to find the longest substring that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as it does forward. If the shortest possible palindrome is of length 1, you should return the first character. Given string: qlblqqlqqqqqb To solve this task, you can iterate through the string and check for palindromic substrings starting from the longest possible substring down to a single character. Here, we can look for the longest palindromic substring using the following steps: 1. Start with the longest possible substring (the entire string), and move inwards by decreasing the length by one. 2. At each step, check if the current substring is a palindrome by comparing its first and last characters. 3. If the substring is a palindrome, that's the longest palindromic substring, and you can stop the search. 4. If not, continue the search by checking the next shorter substring. Applying this method to the given string: 1. We can start by looking at the full string, \\"qlblqqlqqqqqb\\". This is not a palindrome, so we move to the next shorter substring. 2. Next, we check the substrings of length 12, \\"qlblqqlqqqqq\\" and \\"lblqqlqqqqqb\\". Neither of these are palindromes. 3. Moving on to substrings of length 11, we find \\"lblqqlqqqqq\\", \\"blqqlqqqqqb\\", and so on. Continue searching through substrings of decreasing length until you find a palindrome. 4. After checking through substrings, the longest palindromic substring we can find is of length 4, which is, \\"qqlq\\".

His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota. The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City in 1952. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, directed and co-written by Gilliam, was released in 2009. In January 2007, Gilliam announced that he had been working on a new project with his writing partner Charles McKeown. One day later, the fansite Dreams reported that the new project was titled The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. In October 2007, Dreams confirmed that this would be Gilliam's next project and was slated to star Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits. Production began in December 2007 in London. On 22 January 2008, production of the film was disrupted following the death of Heath Ledger in New York City. Variety reported that Ledger's involvement had been a \\"key factor\\" in the film's financing. Production was suspended indefinitely by 24 January, but in February the actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to continue Ledger's role, transforming into multiple incarnations of his character in the \\"magical\\" world of the film. Thanks to this arrangement the principal photography was completed on 15 April 2008, on schedule. Editing was completed in November 2008. According to the official ParnassusFilm Twitter channel launched on 30 March 2009, the film's post-production FX work finished on 31 March. During the filming, Gilliam was accidentally hit by a bus and suffered a broken back. The film had successful screenings including a premiere at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival. The UK release for the film was scheduled for 6 June 2009 but was pushed back to 16 October 2009. The USA release was on 25 December 2009. Eventually, this 30 million-budgeted film had grossed more than 60 million in worldwide theatrical release and received two Academy Award nominations.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Q: Abstract: The possible role of motor development on psychological function is once again a topic of great theoretical and practical importance. The revival of this issue has stemmed from a different approach to the topic, away from Gesell's interest in the long-term prediction of psychological functions from early motoric assessments, toward an attempt to understand how the acquisition of motor skills orchestrates psychological changes. This paper describes how the acquisition of one motor skill, prone locomotion, has been linked to developmental changes in an infant's ability to regulate posture based on information available in patterns of optic flow. It is argued that the onset of prone locomotion presses the infant to differentiate spatially delimited regions of optic flow to effectively and efficiently control the important subtasks nested within the larger task of locomotion, namely, steering, attending to the surface of support, and maintaining postural control. Following this argument, a research program is described that aims to determine if locomotor experience is causally linked to improvements in the ability to functionalize peripheral optic flow for postural control or whether locomotor experience is merely a maturational forecaster of such improvements. Finally, a hypothesis is put forward that links the emergence of wariness of heights to infants' ability to regulate posture on the basis of peripheral optic flow. The paper's overarching theoretical point is the principle of probabilistic epigenesis, which states that one developmental acquisition produces experiences that bring about a host of new developmental changes in the same and different domains..

Analyzing this data enables us to identify disparities and address any potential issues, such as those related to accessibility, healthcare, and education. This article aims to answer the question: How many more males were there for every 100 females than males for every 100 females age 18 and over? Step 1: Collect Data To accurately answer this question, we must first collect the relevant data from reliable sources. The data should include the number of males and females in different age groups, with a focus on those aged 18 and over. Potential sources for this information include census reports, research studies, and government data. Justification: The collection of accurate and up-to-date data is essential to ensure that the analysis is based on facts and can accurately answer the given question. Step 2: Analyze the Data Once the data is collected, it needs to be analyzed to determine the number of males for every 100 females in each age group. This can be achieved by calculating the gender ratio, which is the proportion of males to females in a population. This value can be expressed as a ratio or a percentage. Justification: Analyzing the data will allow us to identify any disparities, trends, or patterns related to the gender distribution in various age groups. This step is crucial to provide an accurate answer to the given question. Step 3: Compare the Ratios To determine how many more males there are for every 100 females than males for every 100 females age 18 and over, we need to compare the gender ratios between the total population and the population aged 18 and over. This can be done by calculating the difference in the number of males per 100 females in each group. Justification: Comparing the ratios allows us to determine any disparities or trends between the two groups, thus enabling a clearer understanding of the demographic distribution, and providing an accurate answer to the given question. Step 4: Interpret the Results Once we have calculated the difference in gender ratios, it is important to interpret the results, considering the sociocultural context and implications. For example, if there is a significant disparity between the number of males and females in various age groups, it could be indicative of issues such as healthcare access, societal pressures, or historical events that have led to this imbalance. Justification: Interpreting the results enables us to answer the question in a more comprehensive and meaningful way, taking into account various factors that could influence the observed demographic distribution. Conclusion In conclusion, calculating and comparing gender ratios between the total population and those aged 18 and over allows us to accurately determine the disparity in the number of males compared to females in these groups. By carefully analyzing the data and considering the contextual factors surrounding the observed distribution, we can answer the question: How many more males were there for every 100 females than males for every 100 females age 18 and over?

When she adds nuts to the cookies, she uses 2 nuts per cookie. If she makes 60 cookies, how many nuts does she need?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To determine how many nuts Maria needs to make Sally's desired cookies, we'll first need to figure out how many cookies have nuts in them. Sally wants: 1. 1/4 of the cookies to have nuts in them, 2. 40% of the cookies to have chocolate chips in them, 3. The remainder to have nuts and chocolate chips in them. From this information, we can calculate the proportions of each type of cookie Maria will make. First, Maria makes 60 cookies in total. 1. Cookies with nuts: 1/4 * 60 = 15 cookies. 2. Cookies with chocolate chips: 0.4 * 60 = 24 cookies. To find the number of cookies with nuts and chocolate chips, we need to consider the remaining cookies: 60 cookies - 15 cookies with nuts - 24 cookies with chocolate chips = 21 cookies with nuts and chocolate chips. Now, let's determine the total number of cookies that have nuts: 15 cookies with nuts + 21 cookies with nuts and chocolate chips = 36 cookies with nuts. Last, Maria uses 2 nuts per cookie. To find the total number of nuts she needs, we simply multiply the number of cookies with nuts by the number of nuts per cookie: 36 cookies with nuts * 2 nuts per cookie = 72 nuts. So, Maria needs 72 nuts to make 60 cookies with Sally's desired cookie-mix proportions."},{"question":"Of the 3 friends, Harry has 4 times as many fish as Joe, and Joe has 8 times as many fish as Sam does.

If the '60s ever come to Planet 51, “we just hope someone writes a protest song about this movie.” The film’s overstuffed creative team—four directors and 13 producers—has produced a “a lame-brained toon that even kids will recognize as an insipid goof on sci-fi conventions,” writes Todd McCarthy of Variety.

While the idea of a human being greeted with paranoia on an extraterrestrial world is intriguing, many critics argue that the film fails to live up to its potential. Glenn Whipp from the LA Times refers to the movie as having a \\"bland, humor-free narrative,\\" relying more on references to other films than actual jokes. Todd McCarthy of Variety is equally unimpressed, describing Planet 51 as a \\"lame-brained toon that even kids will recognize as an insipid goof on sci-fi conventions.\\" The film, directed by four individuals and produced by a massive team of 13, has been accused of being outdated and inaccessible to younger audiences.

His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\".

As governor of the oil-rich Delta state in Nigeria, James Ibori's salary was only 6000 a year, yet he managed to afford luxury properties, fleets of Rolls Royces, a Bentley and a Maybach, first class travel, private boarding school fees and a private jet worth 20 million. In April, accused of money laundering, Ibori pleaded guilty to stealing 80 million, although investigators believe he may have stolen three times as much. He was sentenced to 13 years. Prior to entering politics, Ibori had lived in London, England with his wife Theresa. In 1990, the pair were convicted of stealing from a hardware store where Ibori worked as a cashier. The next year, he was convicted of handling a stolen credit card. By the end of the decade, having lied about his criminal record, Ibori was governor of Delta State, and was reelected for a four year term in 2003. The Africans looking to make it in China. Although acquitted by a Delta State court in 2009, justice finally came for Ibori in a South London court, after a seven year investigation by the Proceeds of Corruption Unit of London's Metropolitan Police. The unit, staffed by a dozen or so detectives, traces the flow of foreign politicians' money through London, and is funded by the UK government's Department for International Development, which also delivers aid to Africa. \\"We hope that, by tackling the likes of James Ibori, we're saying to those stealing from the state purse, you can't have your children at private school in London. You can't have a multimillion pound house in one of the most affluent areas of London. You can't drive around in top of the range vehicles. We won't let you move money around to buy multimillion pound jets,\\" says unit head Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Benton. Ibori employed a range of methods, some straightforward, some devious. He inflated contracts, took kickbacks, and simply transferred cash out of state accounts. He was helped by his family, wife and mistress, as well as by London-based professionals, who set up shell companies, assisted in purchases and provided false due diligence. According to Robert Palmer of anti corruption NGO Global Witness, London holds a double attraction for corrupt politicians. \\"We are a major financial and legal center so there's a lot of expertise, and there's also a lot of assets that go through the British financial institution, so it's easier to disguise your assets.\\" Palmer believes London also seems like a great place to spend \\"illicit loot\\". \\"There's a prestige about being able to bring your assets and your wealth into the UK,\\" he observes. In March, the Financial Services Authority fined Coutts, a private arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, a record 14 million for failing to monitor three-quarters of its high-risk customers, known as Politically Exposed Persons. Although Coutts says it found no evidence of money laundering, and its processes are now robust, campaigners say London's banks are still playing a role in the problem of African corruption. \\"I think we need to see more sanctions,\\" says Chandu Krishnan of Transparency International. \\"And the greater the severity of penalties, the greater the deterrent effect. And that will ensure fewer institutions would commit these offenses.\\" Palmer has similar concerns. \\"According to the prosecutor, Ibori and his associates had accounts with Barclays, HSBC, Citibank. He had a Centurion American Express card. These are major financial institutions that all took money from James Ibori and his associates,\\" he notes. \\"I think the only way we're going to get serious change is if you have heavy penalties, you go after individual bankers and, in the worst cases, in the most egregious failures, you put people in jail.\\" Is narcotic khat funding terrorism? Prosecutors in Ibori's case were aided by a whistleblower, Dotun Oloko. Although Oloko's identity was accidentally leaked back to Nigeria, resulting in his relocation to the UK, he continues to campaign against Nigerian corruption -- whether it's in Britain or Nigeria. He observes a \\"terrible paradox\\": \\"The international financial intermediaries believe they can engage in this kind of activity, being protected by the same states or the same governments that are leading the same anti-corruption battle.\\" Detective Benton says although British banks do cooperate with his unit, tracing the sources of money can still be difficult, particularly without international cooperation. \\"They may have accrued legitimate wealth. They may have had family interests in businesses. What you are trying to do is look at a pot of money and go, 'What is legitimate and what isn't?' and that can be very, very, difficult. A spokesperson from the Proceeds of Corruption Unit said Ibori's embezzled assets will be confiscated and repatriated to their rightful owners -- the people of the Delta State. \\"It is always rewarding for anyone working on a proceeds of corruption case to know that the stolen funds they identify will eventually be returned to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world.\\"","response":"1.

Green village started recording an increased size and number of earthquakes one day. Blue village didn't experience a change in the number of earthquakes. But I can use this background: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.

Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c. Do you have any questions?","response":"Yes, I have a few questions to better understand the historical context of the region: 1. Can you provide more information about the daily life and culture of the people living in Çatalhöyük during its peak? 2. What were the major factors that contributed to the rise and fall of the Hittite Empire during the Old and New Kingdom periods? 3. What happened to the Hittites during the Late Hittite Period, and how did their civilization ultimately come to an end? 4. How did the interactions between the various cultures in Anatolia, such as the Assyrians, Hatti, and Hittites, influence the development of their respective societies and the region as a whole? 5. Can you provide more information about the connections between ancient Anatolian civilizations and their neighbors, such as the Sumerians and the people of Mesopotamia?"},{"question":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions.

This release came more than a year after the launch of the original iPad Pro models and was marked by various significant upgrades and enhancements over the first generation. There were appreciable changes in the second generation, including the terms of size, display, performance, and some new features specifically catered to professionals and creatives, hence the name \\"Pro\\". The second-generation iPad Pro came in two display sizes: 10.5 inches and 12.9 inches. The 10.5-inch model was a new dimension introduced to the iPad Pro line, successfully replacing the original 9.7-inch variant. It offered a larger screen area while maintaining a comfortable size for portability. The improved \\"ProMotion\\" technology in the second generation iPads made a marked difference in the display. ProMotion allowed for a refresh rate of 120Hz, doubling the conventional 60Hz in most other tablets, resulting in fluid scrolling and more responsive inputs. Another significant improvement was the inclusion of the A10X Fusion chip, a step up from the A9X chip used in the first generation. This, combined with an embedded M10 coprocessor, translated to faster and more efficient processing and graphics performance. The iPad Pro second generation also came with better camera capabilities, featuring a 12MP rear camera and a 7MP front camera, also supporting 4K video recording. Additionally, these models featured a more refined four-speaker audio system. On the software front, these devices first shipped with iOS 10. However, later that year, with the release of iOS 11, the iPad Pro Series received some iPad-specific features to improve multitasking and productivity. These included Files, a central place for all files; Dock, an easy access to favorite and frequently used apps and documents; and Drag and Drop feature for moving text, photos, and files from app to app. In terms of availability, the second-generation iPad Pro’s were made available pretty soon after their announcement. Apple started taking pre-orders on June 5, 2017, and the devices hit the stores a week later on June 13, 2017, in the USA. Hence, the launch of the second-generation iPad Pro didn’t merely represent a product upgrade. It was a strategic move by Apple to create a more powerful device targeted toward professional users who require more robust capabilities than the traditional iPad could provide. This demonstrated Apple's commitment to producing dynamic, high-end devices for all types of users, from casual to professional."},{"question":"Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Question: \\"Where did Mohamed Atta reside while in Germany?\\" Answer: \\"Hamburg\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"Where did Mohamed Atta reside while in Germany?\\" is correct.

Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about 430 million, would receive about 92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed. In addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named Ranger Industries Inc. After these payments, about 225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the company's fortunes plunged. But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit 600 million in 1985.

Freeze a sponge saturated with water inside a Ziploc bag. The Ziploc bag is a more suitable option for creating a non-dripping ice pack because it is designed for food storage, and thus it is made to be leak-proof and airtight.

On the other hand, a garbage bag is not a reasonable choice because it's intended for holding larger amounts of waste, not for containing liquids.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

The dominating colours in the Cottage Garden are hot saturated shades of red, orange, and yellow, a colour scheme that both Sackville-West and Nicolson claimed as their own conception. Lord considers it as much a traditional \\"cottage garden as Marie Antoinette was a milkmaid\\". Here, as elsewhere, Sackville-West was much influenced by William Robinson, a gardener she greatly admired and who had done much to popularise the concept of the cottage garden. It contains four beds, surrounded by simple paths, with planting in colours that Sackville-West described as those of the sunset. Plants include a range of dahlias, a particular favourite of Nicolson's, and the red-hot poker, which he despised. In a 1937 letter to his wife he observed, \\"I think the secret of your gardening is simply that you have the courage to abolish ugly or unsuccessful flowers. Except for those beastly red-hot pokers which you have a weakness for, there is not an ugly flower in the whole place.\\"The Herb Garden contains sage, thyme, hyssop, fennel and an unusual seat built around a camomile bush.

The new cards, which most people will have by 2005, contain a microchip on which personal information is stored. This can be checked against databases kept by the government. \\"The information will be locked into the card so that people won' t be able to use false identities,\\" said Ren Tianbu, a security official in Shenyang. China's present plastic identity cards were introduced 17 years ago, and a similar system is used by many other countries. However, the information shown on a card differs from nation to nation. Most ID cards show the holder' s name, sex, date of birth and photograph, as well as the card' s expiry date and number. Germany, France and Spain all use ID cards, but there are some developed nations who dislike the idea. The US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Britain are among those with no national ID card. However, some of the countries have ID cards for particular uses. For example, Australia and the United States use a driving licence to identify people. Identity cards are introduced for a variety of reasons. Race, politics and religion were often at the heart of older ID systems. In recent years, though, ID cards have been linked to national information databases, which form the basis of how a government manages a country. The US, Britain and some other countries are considering a national ID system as a way of preventing possible terrorist attacks.

In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty. They are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975-1990. In 1990, they constituted 9% of the population, but only received 3.1% of the bachelors's degrees awarded. At times when it is favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \\"white\\" by the Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction. In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education. Brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive Latinos as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" Furthermore, native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between Latino groups.\\" Answer:","response":"The territory mentioned in the question, which was inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people, refers to the islands in the Caribbean region, specifically Puerto Rico, Cuba, Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti), and Jamaica. The Ciboney Taíno people were an indigenous group that inhabited the Caribbean, prior to European colonization. The Taínos were known for their advanced agricultural practices, fishing, and craftsmanship. They built their communities typically close to water sources, such as rivers or the coast, to facilitate their fishing and navigation activities. Moreover, they had established a sophisticated social and political organization within their communities, known as cacicazgos, which were led by caciques – the Taíno chieftains. However, following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, European colonization led to a decline in the Taíno population due to diseases brought by the Europeans, enslavement, and other brutalities inflicted upon the indigenous people. Later on, the Taíno culture and population were further diluted as a consequence of intermarriage and cultural assimilation with European settlers and Africans brought to the Caribbean as slaves. Regarding the context provided, it illustrates the historical background and current conditions of various Latino groups in the United States, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans. These three groups made up 80% of the Latino population in the country by 1991. Despite their common cultural heritage and shared ancestral roots with the indigenous people of Latin America, such as the Ciboney Taíno people, Latinos in the United States have faced significant challenges regarding social and economic inequalities. Discrimination, poverty levels, and access to education are significant issues that have disproportionally affected Latinos in comparison to White Americans. Between 1975 and 1990, the high school completion rate for Latinos dropped by 3%, whereas the rate for African Americans increased by 12%. Additionally, in 1990, Latinos comprised 9% of the total population but only received 3.1% of the bachelor's degrees awarded. The categorization of Latinos has been inconsistent, as they were considered \\"white\\" during the Reconstruction when it was convenient but labeled as an inferior race in other cases, demonstrating the continuous struggle for inclusion and recognition in American society. Furthermore, persistent negative stereotypes have plagued the Latino community, as many individuals are perceived as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" This further highlights the marginalization they face in various areas, such as employment, housing, and education. In conclusion, the territory inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people, who are connected ancestrally to modern Latino populations, holds great historical significance when understanding the experiences and challenges faced by Latinos in the United States today."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A bicyclist waits to cross a street.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A bicyclist riding down the trail.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

This sets the context for the reader and helps them understand what the movie is supposed to be about. 'Blundering Through Time', the latest addition to the time-traveling genre, just hit the theaters last week. Boasting a shiny ensemble cast and directed by the once-acclaimed Jacob R. Morrison, this film promised to deliver a thrilling, mind-bending experience but gravely failed to keep up with the expectations. Step 2: Discuss acting and characters In a negative review, it's important to point out where the acting fell short and whether the characters were one-dimensional or lacked depth. Despite an A-list cast featuring talented actors such as James D. Sanders, Lucy Belle, and Ivan Taylor, the characters somehow end up flatter than a sheet of paper. Their dialogues are painfully uninspired and cliche-ridden, making their interactions feel forced and inauthentic. The blame lies not on the actors but on the subpar writing which hampers their individual performances. Step 3: Critique the plot and pacing A central point of criticism in a negative review often comes from a poorly developed plot or inconsistencies in pacing. The film starts off with potential, setting up an intriguing premise that sees our protagonists thrust into a pivotal moment in human history. However, the excitement is short-lived as the plot devolves into a disjointed series of events. 'Blundering Through Time' is a prime example of a poorly executed time-traveling narrative, riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies that only serve to frustrate viewers. Step 4: Discuss the visual aesthetics and soundtrack The visual components and music of a film are often critical aspects of a viewer's experience, and a negative review should reflect shortcomings in these areas. Visually, the film disappoints with lackluster special effects and costume design that appear almost comical at times, further detracting from the immersive and thrilling experience the movie should have been. The soundtrack, composed by Leonard Stone, barely scrapes by as faint background noise and fails to elevate the tension or emotion of any scene. Step 5: Conclude and summarize Wrap up the review by summarizing the points made and driving home the overall opinion formed after watching the movie. After sitting through the mind-numbing 2 hours and 15 minutes of 'Blundering Through Time', it's clear that Jacob R. Morrison's latest venture is a textbook case of wasted potential. Hindered by its weak script, one-dimensional characters, sloppy plot, and uninspired aesthetics, the film leaves viewers feeling shortchanged and frustrated. Despite the time-traveling aspect, it's impossible to escape the sinking feeling that there is nothing new or engaging to be found within this cinematic disaster."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

PUBLISHED:. 11:40 EST, 19 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:17 EST, 19 November 2012. Accused: Bobby and Moira Roberts have been charged with animal cruelty after secret footage revealed they allowed their elephant to be beaten (file picture) The former owners of Britain’s last circus elephant instructed workers to keep her chained up and let a groom beat her, a court heard yesterday. Anne the elephant was kept tethered for days with only a scattering of straw and displayed behaviour caused by stress, it was alleged. Prosecutor Helen Law said Anne, who already had arthritis, rocked backwards and forwards which, as in humans, is a sign of distress. At other times her leg buckled under her. Her suffering was described on the first day of the trial of Bobby and Moira Roberts who are accused of animal cruelty. They run Bobby Roberts Super Circus and Anne, a 59-year-old from Sri Lanka, started working for Mr Roberts back in 1957. Her plight was captured in covert footage obtained by campaign group Animal Defenders International which placed a camera in the barn at the circus’ winter quarters where Anne was kept when not on tour. As well as being chained to the ground by one front and one hind leg, it showed she was hit with various tools including a pitchfork by one of the Roberts’ employees. Neither of the Roberts is accused of hitting Anne themselves but they are charged with failing to take reasonable steps to prevent her being hit by their staff. Miss Law told Northampton Magistrates’ Court that the grooms were ‘plainly inadequately trained’ and one clip from the footage showed Bobby Roberts kicking Anne’s trunk in front of a worker. ‘Bobby Roberts was happy to legitimise the use of casual violence on this elephant,’ she said.Other clips showed Anne being kicked and hit on the flank with a pitchfork by a worker.' After the footage was first made public. in the Daily Mail last year, police and the RSPCA visited the site in. Polebrook, Cambridgeshire, and found Anne’s environment had been. significantly altered. Circus: Anne was kept her chained up for 24-hours-a-day and only un-shackled so they could swap which leg she was chained with, a court heard. New life: Anne now lives at Longleat in a giant paddock with its own sandpit for her to play in (pictured) Fragile: Anne is 58 and video shown to the jury included footage of her being kicked and poked. Allegations: The prosecution say Bobby Roberts would boot Anne in the trunk. She was unchained and in an area of. the barn deep with straw and cordoned off by an electric fence. Miss Law. said this was because the Roberts knew keeping her chained was ‘not. permissible under the required standards’. But the RSPCA was still concerned. Anne was not receiving appropriate medication for arthritis which she. was diagnosed with in 2003, the court heard. The owners agreed to hand. over the elephant to Longleat Wildlife Park. Bobby Roberts, 69, claims he instructed the groom only to keep Anne chained at certain times and to let her go outside when the weather was good. Moira Roberts, 73, claims to have had nothing to do with the elephant’s care. The Roberts, of Oundle, Northamptonshire, each deny causing unnecessary suffering to Anne, failing to prevent employee Nicolai Nitu from causing her suffering, and failing to ensure her needs were met. The groom is thought to have fled to his native Romania. The case continues. Watch the whole film here. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

From 2010 to 2012, he was president of The King's College, a Christian school in New York City. Born in Bombay, D'Souza came to the United States as an exchange student and graduated from Dartmouth College. He became a naturalized citizen in 1991. On July 25, 2016, D'Souza released the documentary film Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party. The film criticizes the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive (and ultimate) Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 2016. The film was universally panned by professional film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4%, based on 27 professional reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. The critics consensus on the site reads, \\"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party finds Dinesh D'Souza once again preaching to the right-wing choir--albeit less effectively than ever.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 2 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". The film has the fifth lowest score of all films on the site. Peter Sobczynski wrote, \\"Hillary's America may well be the single dumbest documentary that I have ever seen in my life.\\" A July 2016 review in Variety characterized D'Souza as \\"a right-wing conspiracy wingnut, the kind of \\"thinker\\" who takes off from Barack Obama birther theories and just keeps going, spinning out a web of comic-book liberal evil.\\" Other critics and figures viewed the film positively. John Fund of the National Review stated that \\"[the film] is over the top in places and definitely selective, but the troubling facts are accurate and extensively documented in the D'Souza book that accompanies the movie.\\" He also called the film \\"intensely patriotic\\". On July 23, 2016, Donald Trump, who was then running as the Republican presidential nominee against Clinton, called on supporters to see the film. On January 23, 2017 the film was nominated for five Razzies including: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Dinesh D'Souza), Worst Actress (Becky Turner), Worst Director (Dinesh D'Souza and Bruce Schooley), and Worst Screenplay. In response to the Razzie nominations, D'Souza stated that he was \\"actually quite honored\\" and called the nominations \\"petty revenge\\" in response to Trump's election victory, also stating that \\"the film might have played an important role in the election.\\" After \\"winning\\" four of the five possible Razzies, D'Souza repeated his view that the nominations were awarded in response to Trump's election victory. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What else was interesting about the article?","response":"The article is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, it provides information about Dinesh D'Souza's background as an Indian American political commentator, author, and filmmaker who came to the United States as an exchange student and later became a naturalized citizen. Secondly, the article discusses D'Souza's documentary film Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, its critical reception, and the extremely negative reviews it received from professional film critics, resulting in low approval ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Another interesting aspect of the article is the discussion about the film's nomination for five Razzies, a tongue-in-cheek award ceremony that \\"honors\\" the worst in film. Despite the negative recognition, D'Souza expressed that he was \\"actually quite honored\\" by these nominations and viewed them as \\"petty revenge\\" in response to Trump's election victory, suggesting that his film played a crucial role in influencing the 2016 presidential elections. Furthermore, the article highlights the polarizing nature of D'Souza's work, as it presents a divide between critics and figures who viewed the film positively or negatively. For instance, while Variety described D'Souza as \\"a right-wing conspiracy wingnut,\\" John Fund of the National Review referred to the film as \\"intensely patriotic.\\" Additionally, Donald Trump, running as the Republican presidential nominee at the time, called on supporters to watch the film. Overall, the article offers an insight into the controversial nature of Dinesh D'Souza's work, as well as some interesting reactions and consequences his documentary film, Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, had in the political and entertainment world."},{"question":"quenching of orbital angular momentum in transition metal complexes??","response":"Okay, imagine you're playing with a spinning top.

His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America. When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of 9,000 (equal to 147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's Encyclopedia in 1820; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.

Now, instead of sharpening their attacks on Democrats, Republicans on Capitol Hill are being forced to explain why they are not to blame and why Americans should trust them to govern both houses of Congress when the one they do run is in such disarray. Complicating the prospects, the grass-roots political force that has provided so much of the energy for conservative victories over the last four years â the Tea Party â is aggressively working against Republicans it considers not conservative enough. As a result, many Republicans are openly worrying that the fallout from the fiscal battles paralyzing the capital will hit hardest not in the House, which seems safely in Republican hands thanks to carefully redrawn districts, but in the Senate. Republican infighting, they say, has given Democrats the cover they need to deflect blame and keep their majority. âThe Tea Party benefits when the energy is focused on the Democratic Party and their agenda,â said Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant and former strategist for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. âWhatâs concerning is a select few groups trying to turn that fire inward on the Republican Party. And that is not helpful.â In states like Georgia, Louisiana and Montana, the members of the House who are now running for the Senate are demanding that Mr. Obama make concessions on the health care law in exchange for reopening the government. That might help in a Republican primary, but it puts the candidates at risk of damaging their viability in the general election. And in other states like Kentucky, where the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, is fighting off a primary challenge from the Tea Party right and would face a strong Democratic opponent, being associated with Republicans in Washington is as freighted as it has ever been. Mr. McConnellâs newest advertisement, in fact, adopts the grievances as his own. âAngry with Washington? So am I,â says Mr. McConnell, a 28-year veteran of the Senate. Many Republicans fear that if Mr. McConnellâs opponent wins the nomination, the seat will flip to the Democrats. With the elections still a year away, it is impossible to tell what other factors might alter the field. But Republicans, Democrats and independent experts all agree that the government shutdown has added one more cross for Republicans to bear. âIf I were running for the U.S. Senate, would I want to be running from Washington? No,â said Charlie Cook, the editor of The Cook Political Report, which tracks Congressional races. âAnd if I were running from Washington, would I want to be running from the House Republican side? No.â The Republicans have little margin of error. A new analysis by Cook Political showed how difficult the math was. The party would need to win five of the six Senate seats considered most competitive to recapture a majority. All six of those seats are in states that Mitt Romney won in 2012, but as Mr. Cook put it, âThe path is very, very, very narrow.â Nowhere are Republican candidates more saddled with baggage from their day jobs in the House than in Georgia, where three members are among those vying for the Senate nomination. Two of the candidates, Representatives Phil Gingrey and Paul Broun, have among the most conservative voting records in the House, and the third, Representative Jack Kingston, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, has a reputation for being far less ideological. In an interview last week, Mr. Kingston objected to his opponentsâ premise that the primary fight was forcing him to be more rigid about the shutdown than he ordinarily would be. He said he was not even remotely centrist. âWait a minute, wait a minute,â he said with a wide grin on his face as he checked off the conservative organizations that had given him high marks. âOne hundred percent National Right to Life. A-plus N.R.A. Ninety-five percent lifetime with the American Conservative Union. And Iâm the moderate?â He said he would side with his more conservative colleagues to defund the health care law or shut the government even if he were not running for the Senate. âTo the degree that going through short-term sacrifice to change the long-term spending pattern of America, it seems to be the only way to get things done in this environment,â he said. A fourth Senate candidate, Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, is trying to use her distance from Washington Republicans as an advantage. In a new ad, she notes that her three opponents have a combined four decades in Washington. âTheir experience is expensive, and the truth is they are the problem,â she says. In Louisiana and Montana, which have a history of electing moderate Democrats to the Senate, the likely Republican nominees are House members who have aligned themselves with the conservatives who are vowing to keep the government closed until Mr. Obama agrees to changes in the health care law. In Montana, Democrats have piled on Representative Steve Daines, a first-term congressman who is expected to run for the seat being vacated by Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat who was first elected in 1978. They have sought to portray Mr. Daines, who signed on to the effort not to vote for a budget until the health care law is stripped of its financing, as a pawn of Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who has led the defunding campaign on Capitol Hill. The Republican candidate in Louisiana, Representative Bill Cassidy, is a three-term veteran who despite having a 92 percent rating from the American Conservative Union has been attacked by some on the right for supporting health care reform as a state legislator. He has also signed on to the Cruz effort. The candidate who seems less likely at this point to be tainted by his association with House Republicans, members of both parties agree, is Representative Tom Cotton, an Arkansas freshman who is challenging Senator Mark Pryor, a two-term Democrat. Mr. Cotton, 36, a former Army Ranger and Harvard Law School graduate, is a distinctive enough candidate that his association with House Republicans, strategists say, could be overshadowed by the more compelling aspects of his biography. For their part, the incumbent Democrats who will face off against the Republicans who have embraced the shutdown strategy seem to feel that they have caught a lucky break. When told the other day that Republicans were hopeful they could topple her by attacking her insistence that Democrats not give in on the health law or the debt ceiling, Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was incredulous. âOh, really?â she said. âOh, really?â What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The article discusses the concerns of Republicans regarding their chances in upcoming Senate elections due to the fallout from fiscal battles and infighting within the party. The Tea Party's aggressive stance against Republicans they deem not conservative enough has generated internal conflict, potentially benefiting the Democrats.

Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL).

And the answer is...","response":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this problem step by step! First, we have this equation: -230*w - 899 + 1322 = -5787 Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation. We have -899 + 1322, which is like having 1322 stickers and then taking away 899 stickers. So, we get 423 stickers (1322 - 899 = 423). The equation now looks like this: -230*w + 423 = -5787 Next, we want to get -230*w by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we'll subtract 423 from both sides. Think of this like having 423 apples on both sides and taking them away. So, we have: -230*w + 423 - 423 = -5787 - 423 This simplifies to: -230*w = -6210 Now, we want to find the value of 'w'. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -230.

He was the first of three children born to William Herschel Cobb (1863-1905) and Amanda Chitwood Cobb (1871-1936). Cobb's father was a state senator. When he was still an infant, his parents moved to nearby Royston, where he was raised. At the age of 62, Cobb married a second time in 1949. His new wife was 40-year-old Frances Fairbairn Cass, a divorcee from Buffalo, New York. Their childless marriage also failed, ending with a divorce in 1956. At this time, Cobb became generous with his wealth, donating 100,000 in his parents' name for his hometown to build a modern 24-bed hospital, Cobb Memorial Hospital, which is now part of the Ty Cobb Healthcare System. He also established the Cobb Educational Fund, which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college, by endowing it with a 100,000 donation in 1953 (equivalent to approximately 914,677 in current year dollars ). He knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both set the record straight on him and teach young players how to play. John McCallum spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography titled The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb that was published in 1956. In December 1959, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and Bright's disease. It was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography, My Life in Baseball: The True Record, with writer Al Stump. Later Stump would claim the collaboration was contentious, and after Cobb's death Stump published two more books and a short story giving what he claimed was the \\"true story\\". One of these later books was used as the basis for the 1994 film Cobb (a box office flop starring Tommy Lee Jones as Cobb and directed by Ron Shelton). In 2010, an article by William R. \\"Ron\\" Cobb (no relation to Ty) in the peer-reviewed The National Pastime (the official publication of the Society for American Baseball Research) accused Stump of extensive forgeries of Cobb-related documents and diaries. The article further accused Stump of numerous false statements about Cobb in his last years, most of which were sensationalistic in nature and intended to cast Cobb in an unflattering light. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did he donate anywhere else?","response":"Yes, Ty Cobb was known to be generous with his wealth, donating to various causes and organizations.

Solve this problem.","response":"To solve this equation, 3*h + 7 = -4*h for h, follow these steps: Step 1: Move all the terms containing h to one side of the equation. To do this, add 4h to both sides of the equation to move it to the left-hand side: 3*h + 4*h + 7 = -4*h + 4*h Combining the terms, we get: 7*h + 7 = 0 Step 2: Isolate h by moving the constant to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 7*h + 7 - 7 = 0 - 7 Which results in: 7*h = -7 Step 3: Solve for h by dividing by the coefficient of h. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 7: (7*h) / 7 = (-7) / 7 This simplifies to: h = -1 Thus, the value of h that satisfies the given equation is h = -1."},{"question":"Solve -5772*s - 217 = -5789*s + 123 for s.","response":"Alright, let's solve this step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old! Imagine you have a big box of apples and a small box of apples. In the big box, you have 5,772 apples, and in the small box, you have 217. And your friend has the same big box of 5,789 apples, and a small box of 123 apples. Now we'll solve for \\"s\\", which is like figuring out how many times you need to give apples from one box to the other to make them equal. So, we want to find a number that helps us make them equal using this equation: -5,772 * s - 217 = -5,789 * s + 123 1. First, we'll move the -5,772*s to the other side of the equation so that we only have one \\"s\\" on each side: -217 + 5,772*s = -5,789*s + 123 + 5,772*s 2. Simplify the equation: -217 = -17*s + 123 3. Now, let's move the 123 to the left side of the equation to get all the numbers on one side: -217 - 123 = -17*s 4. Simplify it again: -340 = -17*s 5. Finally, to find \\"s,\\" we need to figure out how many times -17 goes into -340. To do this, we'll divide: -340 / -17 = s 6. And we find that: s = 20 So, \\"s\\" equals 20. This means you'd need to move the apples 20 times between the boxes to make them equal."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Context: Jordan gave people hugs whether he knew them or not.

Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941) was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. He was the eldest grandchild of the Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and related to many monarchs and princes of Europe, most notably King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Acceding to the throne in 1888, he dismissed the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890. He also launched Germany on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" in foreign affairs that culminated in his support for Austria-Hungary in the crisis of July 1914 that led in a matter of days to the First World War. German foreign policy under Wilhelm II was faced with a number of significant problems. Perhaps the most apparent was that Wilhelm was an impatient man, subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse. He was personally ill-equipped to steer German foreign policy along a rational course. It is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which Wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the German foreign policy elite. There were a number of notorious examples, such as the Kruger telegram of 1896 in which Wilhelm congratulated President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal Republic on the suppression of the British Jameson Raid, thus alienating British public opinion. British public opinion had been quite favourable toward the Kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne, but it turned sour in the late 1890s. During the First World War, he became the central target of British anti-German propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy. Wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other European rulers in the perils they faced by invading China; few other leaders paid attention. Wilhelm used the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War to try to incite fear in the west of the yellow peril that they faced by a resurgent Japan, which Wilhelm claimed would ally with China to overrun the west. Under Wilhelm, Germany invested in strengthening its colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but few became profitable and all were lost during the First World War. In South West Africa (now Namibia), a native revolt against German rule led to the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, although Wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped. One of the few times when Wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in 1900 he supported the marriage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria to Sophie Chotek, against the wishes of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. A domestic triumph for Wilhelm was when his daughter Victoria Louise married the Duke of Brunswick in 1913; this helped heal the rift between the House of Hanover and the House of Hohenzollern which followed the annexation of Hanover by Prussia in 1866.

Reasoning: Speed is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. The distance given is 1.5 km, and the time is 45 minutes. We will convert the time to hours because we need to find the speed in kilometers per hour (km/h). 1. First, let's convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.

(CNN)From leading the fight against colonial rule in Africa to triumphing in major sporting events, Ghanaians have a lot to feel proud of their country. This is after all one of Africa's major economic powerhouses and a country with a rich history that is consistently held up as a successful example of democracy in the continent. Despite its relatively small size and population, Ghana boasts today one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, driven mainly by its substantial natural riches and strong agricultural production.

With these significant discoveries, the country has been able to further diversify and strengthen its economy. Moreover, the revenues generated from the oil and gas sector have been invested in infrastructure development and other essential sectors, such as education, healthcare, and technology, thus improving the overall quality of life for Ghanaians. Besides its natural resources, Ghana is also internationally renowned for its cultural heritage and vibrant traditions. Home to the Ashanti, Fante, Ewe, Ga, and other ethnic groups, the nation has a unique identity that is rooted in a rich tapestry of customs, music, dance, and clothing. The celebration of festivals, such as the Akwasidae, Homowo, and Hogbetsotso, serve as a testament to this diverse cultural heritage and also help to foster a sense of unity and pride. Tourism is yet another key contributor to Ghana's thriving economy, attracting visitors from all around the world. From the stunning coastline with sandy beaches to the lush green nature reserves, the country has numerous attractions that appeal to a wide variety of interests. Furthermore, the UNESCO World Heritage sites, such as the Asante Traditional Buildings, the Cape Coast Castle, and the Elmina Castle, provide an invaluable insight into the nation's turbulent past and its fight for independence. In the realm of sports, Ghana has consistently performed well on the international stage, particularly in football, boxing, and athletics. The Ghanaian national football team, the Black Stars, have qualified for three consecutive FIFA World Cups, while the nation's athletes have won multiple medals at the Olympic Games and other international competitions. These achievements have not only raised Ghana's profile globally but also inspired young athletes in the country to pursue their dreams. Ghana's commitment to democracy and good governance is another reason for it being held up as a successful example on the African continent. Since transitioning to multi-party democracy in 1992, the country has held several peaceful elections, and the peaceful transfer of power between opposing political parties is a significant achievement, especially considering the challenges faced by other nations in the region. In conclusion, Ghana, despite its relatively small size and population, has emerged as one of Africa's major economic powerhouses and a shining example of democracy in the continent. Its successes can be attributed to the abundant natural resources, rich cultural heritage, strong agricultural production, prominence in sports, and commitment to good governance. This progress serves as an inspiration to other countries, and it is evident that Ghanaians have many reasons to feel proud of their nation."},{"question":"Which is this about?

This setting suggests that they are at a celebration that centers around the use of glow-in-the-dark objects. The black-lights emit ultraviolet (UV) light, which causes certain objects and materials to fluoresce - that is, to emit visible light when exposed to UV radiation. In this case, the glow-in-the-dark swirls, the participants' teeth, and the whites of their clothing are likely made from or coated with phosphorescent materials that have the ability to absorb energy from the UV light emitted by the black-lights and then re-emit that energy as visible light, creating a glowing effect. Phosphorescent materials contain special pigments that can store the energy from UV light for some time and then gradually release it as visible light, resulting in the glowing appearance. The celebration seems to involve a foam party as well, as the participants are covered in bubbles and foam that reach up to their thighs. The vivid glowing effects created by the combination of black-lights, phosphorescent materials, and the foam create an immersive, entertaining, and visually striking environment for the people at the event. They can enjoy the unique atmosphere of this glow-in-the-dark party while interacting with one another and experiencing the fun sensation of being surrounded by foam and bubbles. In summary, the glowing objects within the speaker's vision are due to the presence of black-lights and glow-in-the-dark materials in the basement, as well as phosphorescent substances on their clothing and teeth, which all contribute to creating a lively and visually engaging environment for a celebration centered around the use of glow-in-the-dark objects."},{"question":"Find the right ending to this passage.

These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one. The film continues in two parts.Part One: \\"Justine\\" is of an ideal and perfect wedding that sweeps bride Justine along and which clashes with Justines fragile world.This act begins with an clumsy, oversized wedding vehicle unable to negotiate a curve in the road.Newlyweds Justine and Michael (Alexander Skarsgård) arrive two hours late to their own reception at the family estate where Justine's sister Claire and her husband John reside. Justine happens to notice a particularly bright red star in the twilight sky which John identifies as Antares.During the course of the wedding we realise that each of the characters represent a metaphor. These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law, John, represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity. Her dad is hedonistic and selfish therefore unable to connect at a meaningful level with Justine. Her mother ,Gaby (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding. However Justines sister ,Claire, who represents order urges Justine to dishonestly hide her debilitating melancholy from her bland, gormless, doting husband, Michael, (This is highlighted by his wedding speech) and anyway... My question: What crashes into Melancholia?","response":"The planet Melancholia is on a collision course with Earth in the movie. In the final scene of the film, Earth crashes into Melancholia, leading to a catastrophic event and the ultimate destruction of both planets."},{"question":"Question: Lawrence Fox plays the sidekick of which TV detective? Answer:","response":"Lawrence Fox is best known for playing the sidekick of the TV detective Inspector Robert Lewis in the popular British television series, \\"Lewis.\\" The show is a spin-off of the long-running detective series \\"Inspector Morse,\\" in which the character of Lewis, portrayed by Kevin Whately, was the sidekick to the eponymous Inspector Morse, played by John Thaw. \\"Lewis\\" was initially broadcast on ITV from 2006 to 2015 and consisted of nine series featuring the dynamic duo of DI Robert Lewis and DS James Hathaway, played by Lawrence Fox. As DS Hathaway, Fox's character is an intelligent and contemplative young detective with a deep understanding of human nature, which he employs to solve intricate mysteries. He is also a former seminarian, bringing a unique perspective and depth to the character. The combination of Lewis' down-to-earth, pragmatic approach and Hathaway's intellectual, emotionally-driven intuition makes them a highly effective team. Consequently, they work together to crack challenging cases, often related to the University of Oxford's prestigious academic sphere. Created by the author Colin Dexter, the series is set in Oxford, providing beautiful backdrops and fascinating mysteries. The episodes are often full of literary allusions and connections to Oxford's historical legacy, reflecting the sophistication and depth of the detective genre.

Weldon Gaston \\"Hum\\" Humble (April 24, 1921 - April 14, 1998) was an American football guard who played five seasons in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Browns and Dallas Texans in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Humble grew up in Texas and was a multi-sport athlete at Brackenridge High School in San Antonio. He enrolled at Rice University in Houston, Texas in 1940 and played three seasons on the school's football team. Humble then spent three years in the U.S. Marines during World War II, serving in the Pacific War and earning a Bronze Star Medal before returning to complete his college studies in 1946. Humble was born in Nixon, Texas, a suburb of San Antonio, in 1921. His athletic career began at San Antonio's Brackenridge High School. Humble played as an end for two seasons and a fullback for a third season on the football team. He also played on the basketball, track and swimming teams before graduating and enrolling at Rice University in Houston, Texas in 1940. Humble began play on Rice's freshman team as an end in 1940. He advanced to the varsity team the next year. While he started as an end, coach Jess Neely switched him to guard before the first game of the season. He thrived in the new position, and was named a sophomore all-star by the Associated Press after the Rice Owls finished 1941 with a 6-3-1 win-loss-tie record. The following year, Humble earned All-Southwestern Conference honors and won the George Martin Award, given to Rice's most valuable player, as Rice put up a 7-2-1 record. Humble left Rice in 1943 for the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then called Southwestern Louisiana Institute, to prepare for service in World War II in a V-12 U.S. Navy training program. As he trained, he played alongside enlistees from Tulane University, the University of Tulsa and Louisiana State University on a military team that won six straight games and was selected to play in the first Oil Bowl in Houston. Captained by Humble, Southwestern beat a service team from Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio. After the season, Humble enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was sent to fight in the Pacific War. He rose to the rank of first lieutenant and won a Bronze Star Medal. Upon his discharge in 1946, Humble returned to Rice. He lettered in football and track and field and was voted a consensus first-team All-American guard while captain of Rice's Southwestern Conference co-champion team. He was also named lineman of the week by the Associated Press in November for his strong tackling in a game against the Texas A&M Aggies. After finishing with an 8-2 record, Rice beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl game in early 1947. Rice was ranked the 10th-best college team in the nation in the AP Poll.","response":"This text is about Weldon Gaston \\"Hum\\" Humble, an American football guard who played in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Browns and Dallas Texans in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble and matron Mrs. Corney. At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin.

Types of white blood cells can be classified in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils (acidophiles), basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytic.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers. Question: \\"Was there a normal amount of passengers on United 99-33 on 9/11?\\" Response: \\"There were many empty seats\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","response":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

[a]. yes. [b]. it is not possible to tell. [c]. no.","response":"[b]. It is not possible to tell. To properly address the question, we need to first understand the context and the meaning of the terms used. In this scenario, George W. Bush, a political figure, is competing with others who hold opposing perspectives on a particular issue – let's call it \\"Issue X\\". The \\"talking heads\\" refer to pundits, commentators, and experts in the media who often weigh in on these issues and help shape public opinion. In the original statement, \\"Since the talking heads agree with Bush's competitors that it's a non-story, Round 1 goes to Bush\\", it indicates that the media commentators agreed with Bush's competitors that Issue X was not worth considering or discussing. However, the statement does not elaborate on why this agreement resulted in the perceived victory for Bush in the \\"first round\\". Without this information, it is difficult to determine if the inverse statement would have the opposite outcome. The inverse statement is: \\"Since the talking heads agree with Bush's competitors that it is a real story, Bush lost the first round.\\" Again, we don't have enough details to say definitively whether this statement is true or false. It is possible that the media agreeing with Bush's competitors on the issue being a real story could be disadvantageous for Bush, but we would need more information on the nature of the issue and the political landscape to draw a firm conclusion.

This significant upswing has resulted in the third highest level on record, a particularly remarkable achievement considering the ongoing global pandemic and its impact on the economy. In light of this development, the present analysis aims to explore the various factors contributing to this surge, its implications for the housing sector, and what this could mean for both potential homebuyers and the broader US economy. Section 1: Factors Contributing to the Rise in New Home Sales In this section, we will delve into the driving forces behind the substantial growth observed in September's new home sales. Various factors would be considered, such as: 1.1. Low mortgage rates: A detailed examination of the current mortgage rates would be undertaken, along with an exploration of how these low rates have incentivized potential homebuyers to purchase new homes. 1.2. Shifts in preferences: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer preferences would be discussed, such as the increasing penchant for larger homes and suburban living, as well as the eagerness of city dwellers to relocate to less crowded areas. 1.3. Demand-supply dynamics: An evaluation of supply-chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, along with how it has led to a scarcity in available homes and a subsequent increase in demand – and therefore, sales – would be undertaken. Section 2: Implications for the Housing Sector The discussion would then shift to the ripple effects of this surge in new home sales on various aspects of the housing market, including: 2.1. Home prices: An examination of the impact on home prices, particularly, whether the increased demand for new homes has led to a rise in prices as well. 2.2. Builders' confidence: Consideration would be given to the effect of these increased sales on the confidence of home builders, and any subsequent increase in construction activity. 2.3. Rental market: The potential influence on the rental market would also be explored, as home sales often negatively affect rental demand. Section 3: Broader Implications for the US Economy In this section, we will assess the repercussions these developments may have on the broader US economy. Topics to be considered include: 3.1. Economic recovery: The importance of the housing sector as a driving force contributing to economic recovery in light of the slump caused by the pandemic would be discussed. 3.2. Employment opportunities: The analysis would delve into the impact of increased home sales and construction activity on job creation and employment rates in the housing and construction sectors. 3.3. Policy implications: Lastly, we would explore possible government interventions or policy adjustments that may arise from these developments. Conclusion: In conclusion, the analysis would recap the factors behind the notable increase in new home sales in September, its repercussions on the housing market, and possible broader implications for the US economy. This comprehensive study aims to shed light on the current market trends and help stakeholders make more informed decisions in the ever-evolving housing landscape."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the album that became the best-selling double-album of the decade? During 1995 Corgan wrote about 56 songs, following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as \\"The Wall for Generation X\\", and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death. Praised by Time as \\"the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet\\", Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade.

As others have noted, the autofocus is annoyingly slow. Also, you cannot raise the flash manually when you know you will need it. Instead, you must depress the shutter button, which results in an unintended flash photo occuring half the time. Lastly, the close focus limit is rather distant making macro photos impossible.

Which may sound odd coming from someone who ceaselessly praises love and sex, but it is true. I am not a fan. My mother and father were married in a small Baptist Church on Valentine’s Day in 1959. They are no longer together. They are still technically married but my father now lives in a residential care home for dementia patients and my mother lives alone. My father’s disease makes him angry and aggressive leaving my mother with blurred and fading memories of his kindness. It is a sad day for all those whose partners are transformed into strangers by illnesses. Some things aren’t fair. It is my step(ish) daughter’s birthday on Valentine’s Day (I am not married to my boyfriend so I can’t claim to be a step-mum and there is no other term for it). The end of my boyfriend’s marriage has put continents between him and his children. When he hangs up the phone after talking to his daughter, his eyes are dark with pain. It is a sad day for all those whose love is diluted by oceans. Some things can’t be changed. I remember the last Valentine’s Day I spent with my ex-husband. I was a couple of weeks away from moving out but I hadn’t told him yet. I felt sick and scared and heartbroken. My husband and I passed the entire day without speaking. As I stood on the edge of the cliff summoning up the courage to jump, I felt entirely alone. It is a sad day for all those whose love has withered away. Some things can’t be fixed. I want to believe that “love is all you need” because it feels as though it could almost be true, but then I remember, on days like this, that for as many hearts that sing, there are equally as many that struggle to beat.

A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \\"teachable moment\\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night.

Australian Stoner began the race in pole position and led for the opening 17 of the 23-lap race. But Lorenzo took the lead with a superb overtaking move on a steep, downhill chicane and steadily pulled away for an impressive victory, with Stoner having to contend with finishing in third position after also being overtaken by Honda teammate Andrea Dovizioso on the final lap.

Options: - anger - open mind - biology book - smartness - cynicism Please answer and provide answer explanation.","response":"An open mind is the most crucial factor leading someone to learn about the world. Explanation: While other options such as biology books and smartness can contribute to learning about specific aspects of the world, having an open mind is the key to overall learning and understanding. An open mind refers to a willingness to consider new ideas, experiences, and perspectives. People with open minds are curious and eager to learn from various sources. They approach the world with a sense of wonder and are not limited by established beliefs or opinions. This attitude makes them more receptive to expanding their knowledge and understanding of the world. Anger, on the other hand, may not be conducive to learning about the world, as it typically narrows a person's focus, often leading to negative or destructive actions rather than learning. A biology book, while informative, is a limited resource that can only teach about a certain field of study. In reality, learning about the world requires accessing and integrating a wide variety of sources and disciplines. Smartness, or intelligence, may help a person learn about the world more efficiently, but it is not the primary factor that leads someone to seek knowledge. A smart person might not be inclined to learn about the world if they lack curiosity or an open mind. Finally, cynicism can hinder learning. Cynics tend to view the world and its inhabitants negatively, which may discourage them from seeking new information and experiences. An open mind, on the other hand, encourages optimism and the desire to better understand the complex world we live in."},{"question":"Summarize the following: At the top of your note, write down the patient’s age and sex.

Article: Wearing ties was originally the mark of Britain's most powerful classes, which made the tie itself a symbol of power and respect. And that led it to be adopted by a much larger tribe--the business tribe. You cannot wear a tie if you work with machinery. So wearing a tie became a sign that you were a man who used your brain to make a living, rather than your hands. It showed you were serious. It showed you were a professional. It meant that everyone who wanted a job in business had to wear one. It was just impossible to take seriously a man who didn't wear a piece of color1ed silk around his neck. This is how millions of people came to be wearing ties across the world. They are part of the uniform of business. \\"Ties offer a point of indifference,\\" says John Milne, head of the British Guide of Tie Makers. \\"They give a chance to say something about their own personality.\\" So if you happen to meet a man with a very brightly color1ed tie, there is a good chance that he is the office joker. There is also a good chance that he will be wearing brightly color1ed socks. Is there a future for ties? The signs are not promising. Tie wearing seems to be rare among the new bread of entrepreneurs in the Internet and new technology industries. Many political leaders,including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, now go without ties. This shows they are men of the people--but not the people wearing ties. Up until around 1960, it was common for men across the Western world to wear hats as part of their business uniform. That changed with the election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency of the United States. Kennedy never wore a hat in fact his nickname was\\"hatless Jack\\". Seeing that the most powerful man in the world did not have to wear a hat, millions of other men decided that they did not have to, either. Hats simply vanished across the Western world. Perhaps\\"tieless Tony\\"(UK Prime Minister Tony Blair) will have the same effect as \\"hatless Jack\\". Question: The writer may hold the opinion that _ . Answer: Answer:","response":"The writer may hold the opinion that the future of ties is uncertain and their popularity may decline, similar to how hats disappeared from the mainstream business attire after John F. Kennedy chose not to wear them. This is suggested by the decrease in tie-wearing among new entrepreneurs in technology industries and political leaders like British Prime Minister Tony Blair."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden","response":"The final step of the described process is the formation of a fossil.

After the rest of his gang is killed in a robbery-gone-wrong, Jack survives only to read of the events in the newspaper that he was nothing next to others. Annoyed at not being recognised as an outlaw, Jack attempts a robbery by himself, and ends up taking young mute Ben Doyle as a hostage. He later discovers that, tired of never having been treated with respect due to his disability, Ben wishes to join him. Jack attempts to teach Ben how to fire a gun and rob banks, with his first attempt at \\"on-the-job\\" training ending with Ben shooting himself in the foot. Across the course of the training, they pay occasional visits to saloons where Jack shows Ben the truth about adult life, including helping him to lose his virginity. However, the true nature of the saloon visits is for Jack to make contact with showgirl Lana Castel, who, unbeknownst to Jack, is madly in love with him. When Ben's training is complete, the two learn of a bank which is said the entire town armed and ready to protect it. Jack sees this as the test he has been waiting for, and together they hatch a plan to rob it.

The project involves the installation of a new electricity distribution connection, approximately 19 miles (30km) in length, linking areas from Llandyfaelog, positioned to the east of Idole, under the River Towy, and then to the west of Peniel. The company plans to install about 4.3 miles (7km) of this connection underground, however, critics of the project are opposing the use of overhead lines on wooden double-poles for the rest of the connection. These overhead power line wooden poles are said to be up to 18m (59ft) high. Opponents argue that the installation of these overhead power lines would negatively impact the local community, the environment, as well as the tourism sector in the area. They believe the development would damage people's lives within the vicinity, disrupt the local ecology, and possibly deter tourists, therefore having potential adverse impacts to the local economy. To address the voiced concerns, Andrew Hubbold, a representative from Western Power Distribution, made known that the company plans to publish a Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) in the coming autumn. This SoCC will outline how the third and final stage of the consultation process for the proposed connection will be conducted. This final stage seems designed to allow community members to voice their opinions and have a say in the project. Upon the conclusion of the consultation, Western Power Distribution will then submit an application to the Planning Inspectorate for assessment and a final decision regarding the project.

Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going.

To do that, we need to subtract 88 from both sides of the equation. 63 * x + 88 - 88 = -416 - 88 63 * x = -504 Step 2: Now we have 63 * x = -504. To find the value of 'x', we must divide both sides of the equation by 63, like this: (63 * x) / 63 = -504 / 63 x = -8 So, the value of 'x' we were looking for is -8.

A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

This ensures that they are both ready and on the same page before starting any game or activity together. Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are not as suitable: - Laugh: While laughter can be a part of playing and spending time with a friend, it is not typically the first thing that must happen before starting to play. Laughing might occur during or after playing when they share fun moments together. - Sit: Sitting does not necessarily mean they are preparing to play, nor is it an essential step to take before playing. They may sit together while discussing what they want to do, but it's not a direct requirement for starting a game or activity. - Being entertained: While playing can be entertaining, \\"being entertained\\" is a somewhat passive term that doesn't imply they are preparing to play themselves. They might be entertained by watching a show or by someone else's performance, but it does not suggest active participation. - Math: Math is a subject and an activity on its own, not related to the general context of kids going to play. While they might do math together as part of their play, it is not a prerequisite to their playing activities. To summarize, \\"meet\\" is the most appropriate answer because it is the most logical and necessary step to be taken before kids can begin engaging in play together.

The answer is:","response":"Gaborone"},{"question":"Elbridge Gerry was born on July 17, 1744, in Marblehead, Massachusetts. His father, Thomas Gerry, was a merchant operating ships out of Marblehead, and his mother, Elizabeth (Greenleaf) Gerry, was the daughter of a successful Boston merchant. Gerry's first name came from John Elbridge, one of his mother's ancestors. Gerry's parents had eleven children in all, although only five survived to adulthood. Anti-Federalist forces nominated Gerry for governor in 1788, but he was predictably defeated by the popular incumbent John Hancock. Following ratification, Gerry recanted his opposition to the Constitution, noting that a number of state ratifying conventions had called for amendments that he supported. He was nominated by friends (over his own opposition to the idea) for a seat in the inaugural House of Representatives, where he then served two terms. In June 1789 Gerry proposed that Congress consider all of the proposed constitutional amendments that various state ratifying conventions had called for (notably those of Rhode Island and North Carolina, which had at the time still not ratified the constitution). In the debate that followed, he led opposition to some of the proposals, arguing that they did not go far enough in ensuring individual liberties. He successfully lobbied for inclusion of freedom of assembly in the First Amendment, and was a leading architect of the Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure. He sought unsuccessfully to insert the word \\"expressly\\" into the Tenth Amendment, which might have more significantly limited the federal government's power. He was successful in efforts to severely limit the federal government's ability to control state militias. In tandem, with this protection, he had once argued against the idea of the federal government controlling a large standing army, comparing it - most memorably and mischievously - to a standing penis: \\"An excellent assurance of domestic tranquility, but a dangerous temptation to foreign adventure.\\" Gerry vigorously supported Alexander Hamilton's reports on public credit, including the assumption at full value of state debts, and supported Hamilton's new Bank of the United States, positions consistent with earlier calls he had made for economic centralization. Although he speculated in depreciated Continental bills of credit (the IOUs at issue), there is no evidence he participated in large-scale speculation that attended the debate when it took place in 1790, and he became a major investor in the new bank. He used the floor of the House to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to republican ideals, and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties. He opposed any attempt to give officers of the executive significant powers, specifically opposing establishment of the Treasury Department because its head might gain more power than the President. He opposed measures that strengthened the Presidency (such as the ability to fire cabinet officers), seeking instead to give the legislature more power over appointments. Gerry did not stand for re-election in 1792, returning home to raise his children and care for his sickly wife. He agreed to serve as a presidential elector for John Adams in the 1796 election. During Adams' term in office, Gerry maintained good relations with both Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, hoping that the divided executive might lead to less friction. His hopes were not realized: the split between Federalists (Adams) and Democratic-Republicans (Jefferson) widened. What was he most known for as a House Member?","response":"Elbridge Gerry is most known for his significant contributions to the drafting and adoption of the Bill of Rights during his time in the House of Representatives. He was a strong advocate for individual liberties and played a key role in the debates surrounding the proposed amendments. Gerry was particularly influential in securing the inclusion of freedom of assembly in the First Amendment and was one of the primary architects of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Additionally, Gerry was known for his opposition to the perceived expansion of federal government powers and sought to limit them through various proposals. For instance, he tried to insert the word \\"expressly\\" into the Tenth Amendment to more definitively restrict federal authority. Although unsuccessful in this effort, he managed to help shape limitations on the federal government's power over state militias. Despite his prior anti-Federalist stance, once in the House of Representatives, Gerry supported Alexander Hamilton's economic centralization efforts, including the assumption of state debts and the establishment of the Bank of the United States. However, he remained wary of executive powers, opposing measures that he believed would strengthen the presidency or limit individual and state liberties. In summary, Elbridge Gerry was most known as a House member for his instrumental role in shaping the Bill of Rights, his advocacy for individual liberties and states' rights, and his participation in the development of early American economic policy."},{"question":"Translate \\"“Junto con la revisión de la cartera de Navracsics, el papel central de Moscovici, y una nueva competencia compartida sobre los medicamentos y los productos sanitarios entre la Dirección General de Salud y Asuntos del Consumidor (DG SANCO), y la Dirección General de Empresa e Industria (DG Empresa), podemos decir que hemos contribuido a perfilar una nueva Comisión que es distinta y está mucho más cerca de nuestros valores.\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"Alright, honey, this sentence is a little bit hard.

Yes or no? Answer: The conducting zone and the respiratory stuffers (but not the alveoli) are made up of airways . Question: how many lungs does a human have The answer is:","response":"Yes, the conducting zone and the respiratory structures (excluding the alveoli) consist of airways that help transport air in and out of the lungs. However, the original question asked about the number of lungs a human has, and the answer to that question is: a human has two lungs, the right lung and the left lung. The human respiratory system plays a vital role in the exchange of gases between the body and the environment. The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during the process of breathing. The lungs, located within the thoracic cavity, are protected by the ribcage and are separated by the mediastinum, a central cavity that contains the heart and other vital organs. The left and right lungs differ slightly in size and shape, with the left lung being marginally smaller to accommodate the heart's position in the chest. The left lung has two lobes, superior and inferior, while the right lung has three lobes: superior, middle, and inferior. These lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments, which are functionally and anatomically distinct units within the lungs. The respiratory system can be divided into two primary regions: the conducting zone and the respiratory zone. The conducting zone consists of airways that carry air into and out of the lungs, such as the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. These structures help warm, filter, and moisten the incoming air before it reaches the respiratory zone. The respiratory zone is where the actual gas exchange occurs, featuring structures like respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and most importantly, the alveoli. The alveoli are tiny sacs surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, allowing for efficient oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between the air and the bloodstream. In conclusion, while the airways play a crucial role in the respiratory system, the core of your original question is about the number of lungs a human possesses. Humans have two lungs - the left and the right - which facilitate the essential gas exchange needed to support life functions."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

For example, the problem of factoring - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time . - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\" - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm. 'np-hardness' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'subclass of'?

He fired the first shot in defense of Fort Sumter, the opening battle of the war, and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg. Gettysburg was his finest hour, but his relief by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade caused lasting enmity between the two men. Although Doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles, he is more widely known as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball, in Elihu Phinney's cow pasture in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839. The Mills Commission, chaired by Abraham G. Mills, the fourth president of the National League, was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee's final report, on December 30, 1907, stated, in part, that \\"the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.\\" It concluded by saying, \\"in the years to come, in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball, and the millions who will be, Abner Doubleday's fame will rest evenly, if not quite as much, upon the fact that he was its inventor ... as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the Federal Army.\\" However, there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills Commission as a \\"myth\\". He wrote, \\"Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\\" At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game, and his New York Times obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life. Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839. Despite the lack of solid evidence linking Doubleday to the origins of baseball, Cooperstown, New York became the new home of what is today the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1937. There may have been some relationship to baseball as a national sport and Abner Doubleday. While the modern rules of baseball were formulated in New York during the 1840s, it was the scattering of New Yorkers exposed to these rules throughout the country, that spread not only baseball, but also the \\"New York Rules\\", thereby harmonizing the rules, and being a catalyst for its growth. Doubleday was a high-ranking officer, whose duties included seeing to provisions for the US Army fighting throughout the south and border states. For the morale of the men, he is said to have provisioned balls and bats for the men. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did he invent baseball?","response":"The article states that the Mills Commission claimed Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Elihu Phinney's cow pasture in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839. However, it also mentions that there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim and that the results of the Mills Commission have been described as a \\"myth\\" by baseball historian George B. Kirsch. Doubleday's own letters and papers never mention baseball, and his obituary didn't mention the game either.

Top officials in the US administration were reportedly aghast when they looked closely at some of his past positions. And UK Prime Minister David Cameron told the Conservative Party conference: \\"We cannot let that man inflict his security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating ideology on the country we love.\\" But how radical a shift for the Labour Party does Mr Corbyn represent when it comes to key foreign policy issues? Initially his position on whether to stay in the EU or leave was ambiguous. Mr Corbyn said he wanted a Europe that did more for social and environmental protections and not just the free market. He lambasted the EU's talks with the US over a new Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as \\"secret negotiations\\" that would \\"sign away\\" many public services. He said he had mixed feelings about the upcoming EU referendum and hinted he might not campaign to stay in. But later he clarified that he could not foresee Labour under his leadership campaigning to leave the EU, and he used his conference speech to call for a \\"vision of social Europe\\" to protect workers' rights and offer more help to refugees. His shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, went further, declaring unequivocally that \\"Britain's future lies in Europe\\", the coming EU referendum was the most important decision for 40 years for Britain's place in the world, and there would be a Labour campaign to stay in. In the past, Mr Corbyn has called for Britain to pull out of the Nato alliance and scrap its Trident nuclear deterrent, dismissing both as outdated relics from the Cold War. Since becoming party leader he has backtracked on leaving Nato, but his personal opposition to Trident remains strong. However, not everyone, including his own deputy leader, agrees with him. In a blow to his leadership, trade union leaders (concerned about defence jobs) blocked a vote at Labour's conference on whether to scrap Trident. Instead, the conference voted to keep Labour's official position in support of a \\"continuous at-sea deterrent\\" - in other words, maintaining Trident. Mr Corbyn has said he will continue to try to persuade colleagues to change their minds. Criticism of Nato has also coloured the Labour leader's attitude towards Russia's role over the past two years in Ukraine. He has argued the \\"hypocrisy of the West\\" and the eastward expansion of Nato was partly to blame for provoking the conflict in Ukraine, though he admits that Russia violated Ukraine's sovereignty by taking over Crimea. More recently as Labour Party leader, he has said he is \\"not an admirer of Putin's foreign policy\\". But his bottom-line position is that it is better to reach out through diplomacy to \\"talk to everyone\\" (even groups like Hamas and Hezbollah) rather than promote further confrontation and bloodshed through military options. Mr Corbyn has consistently been opposed to \\"military interventions\\" on principle, including what he has called the \\"disaster\\" of the 2003 Iraq invasion. He has even suggested the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair could end up facing a war crimes tribunal for his part in leading the country into what Mr Corbyn says was an illegal war. He has said he will oppose any new vote in Parliament for air strikes against the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria as well as Iraq, because bombing would only make IS militants stronger. Instead, he has argued for isolating the jihadists through collective diplomacy involving all Syria's neighbours and Russia. But this is another issue that divides Labour MPs, some of whom have indicated they might defy him to side with the government if it pushed for a vote to approve UK air strikes in Syria as well as Iraq. And since Russia has begun its own bombing campaign in Syria, Mr Corbyn has not made clear whether he is prepared to condemn \\"military intervention\\" in the Syria conflict by Russia as well. Overall, Mr Corbyn says the country needs a \\"radically different foreign policy\\", including standing up for human rights instead of selling weapons to repressive regimes, more international collaboration, and \\"clever, patient, difficult\\" diplomacy rather than military interventions. But at the same time, in his conference speech he called for \\"strong modern military and security forces\\" to keep Britain safe, and for jobs in the defence industry to be protected. And not everyone on Labour's shadow front bench shares their new leader's positions. Mr Corbyn embraces that difference of opinion as a strength, saying that airing diverse views within the party and not always agreeing on everything is part of his \\"new politics\\". But it means that how far his past personal radicalism will translate into party positions remains unclear. What is a summary of this text?","response":"The text talks about a politician named Mr. Corbyn who has become the leader of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. His ideas about foreign policy are different from what the party has believed in before. Some people like that he has new ideas, but others are worried about the changes he might bring. Mr. Corbyn wants to focus on talking and working together with other countries instead of fighting with them. He has changed his mind about some things, like being a part of NATO and the European Union, but he still has strong opinions about not using nuclear weapons and not getting involved in wars. Some people in his party agree with him, but others don't. It's not clear yet how much his ideas will change the whole party."},{"question":"One of the most famous religious revolts is the Pule Revolt, more formally known as the Religious Revolt of Hermano Pule. Undertaken between June 1840 and November 1841, this revolt was led by Apolinario de la Cruz, otherwise known as \\"Hermano Pule\\". De la Cruz started his own religious order, the Confraternity of Saint Joseph in Lucban, located in the present-day province of Quezon , in June 1840. However, there were two types of priests in the Philippines then: secular priests, or parish priests, which were usually Indio, and religious priests, or convent priests, which were usually Spanish. Due to the concentration of Spanish religious power and authority in the already-established religious orders and the concept that Filipino priests should only stay in the church and not the convent and vice versa , the Spanish government banned the new order, especially due to its deviation from original Catholic rituals and teachings, such as prayers and rituals suited for Filipinos.However, thousands of people in Tayabas, Batangas, Laguna and even Manila already joined. Because of this, the Spanish government sent in troops to forcibly break up the order, forcing De la Cruz and his followers to rise in armed revolt in self-defense. Many bloody battles were fought with the order's last stand in Mount San Cristobal, near Mount Banahaw, in October 1841. The Spaniards eventually won, and Apolinario de la Cruz was executed on November 4, 1841 in the then-provincial capital, Tayabas.

Translate to English","response":"No one seems to believe that they should be blamed for anything. Here is a detailed explanation of the translation: The original Finnish sentence, \\"Kukaan ei näytä uskovan, että heitä pitäisi syyttää mistään,\\" can be translated into English while also maintaining the meaning and sentiment behind each word and phrase. 1. Kukaan: This Finnish word translates to \\"no one\\" or \\"nobody\\" in English. It conveys the idea that not a single person feels a certain way or holds a particular belief. In this sentence, it refers to a group of people who do not accept certain opinions or views. 2. ei näytä: This phrase translates to \\"does not seem\\" in English. It signals that there is no clear indication or appearance that something is true. 3. uskovan: This verb means \\"to believe\\" in Finnish. The \\"-van\\" ending indicates the present participle or continuous form, which is denoted in English by appending \\"ing\\" to the verb (e.g., \\"believing\\"). 4. että: This Finnish conjunction is the equivalent of the English conjunction \\"that.\\" It is used to introduce a subordinate clause, where a noun or pronoun is both the subject and the object of the verb. 5. heitä: This is the third-person plural pronoun, which translates to \\"them\\" in English. In the context of this sentence, it refers to the group of people mentioned in the beginning. 6. pitäisi: This verb translates to \\"should\\" in English. It is used to express that something is advisable or desirable in a particular situation. 7. syyttää: This verb means \\"to blame\\" in Finnish. In this context, the blame could be for a wrongdoing, mistake, or any other negative action. 8. mistään: This adverb expresses the idea of \\"from anything\\" or \\"for anything\\" in English. It implies that the individuals in question believe they cannot be held accountable for any specific action or event. Putting all these components together, the English translation is: \\"No one seems to believe that they should be blamed for anything.\\" This sentence expresses that the people in question do not think they should be held responsible or held accountable for any actions or events that they may have been involved in or for which they might be criticized."},{"question":"De exemplu, reprezentanţii UE au criticat campania \\"Cumpăraţi produse croate\\" sponsorizată de stat.

Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned.

Shortly after finding one, Meggie comes across a marten with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger.

Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation.

Considering the various solutions that are launched to increase muscle mass and enhance body weight, many people are baffled as to what products they should take advantage of. In this detailed review, we will discuss the Xtreme No bodybuilding supplement and its effectiveness in helping individuals reach their fitness goals. Xtreme No, available in Carletonville, South Africa, is a muscle mass building supplement that aims to improve workout performance and support efficient muscle gain. It is designed to help people, especially athletes and bodybuilders, achieve their desired physique by speeding up the muscle-building process. As a muscle mass building supplement, Xtreme No is packed with essential nutrients that the body needs to grow stronger muscles and increase overall performance. These ingredients include L-arginine, an amino acid that enhances the production of nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide aids in expanding blood vessels, which in turn improves blood flow and delivers more oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. When comparing Xtreme No to other muscle mass building supplements in the market, it is essential to consider its unique formula that caters to the different needs of individuals. For example, its blend of active ingredients works synergistically to provide users with better performance during workout sessions, promote muscle growth, and improve post-workout recovery. On top of that, Xtreme No claims to help boost energy levels, allowing users to train harder and longer. Super Charge Xtreme No, on the other hand, is a pre-workout supplement that aims to offer intense energy, focus, and endurance to get the most out of a workout session. It contains caffeine, creatine monohydrate, beta-alanine, and other compounds to enhance workout performance. When comparing Xtreme No and Super Charge Xtreme No, it is essential to note that both products target similar goals – improving workout performance and building muscle mass. However, Xtreme No focuses on boosting nitric oxide levels to enhance blood flow and support muscle growth, while Super Charge Xtreme No targets energy, focus, and endurance through its stimulant-based formula. In conclusion, both the Xtreme No bodybuilding supplement and the Super Charge Xtreme No pre-workout supplement have their unique formulas and functions. However, based on the ingredients and overall goals, it seems that Xtreme No offers a more comprehensive approach to muscle building and workout performance enhancement. Users should also consider factors like personal preferences, their current fitness level, and workout routines before making a final decision on which product will work best for them. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional or fitness expert before beginning any supplementation regimen, especially if one has pre-existing medical conditions or is taking prescribed medications. This measure will ensure that the chosen product is safe and effective for the individual's specific needs and goals."},{"question":"As Universal's main product had always been low-budget film, it was one of the last major studios to have a contract with Technicolor.

The focus shifts to West Belarus, where Nazi SS soldiers, under the command of Bernicki, the Belarussian Police Captain, are busy \\"sanitizing\\" a village, killing half the people and abducting the rest. Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber) and his brother, Asael (Jamie Bell), watch helplessly from the forest. Once the Germans have left, they run to the village and are devastated to find their father dead.

They take him with them to the forest.In the Lipiczanska Forest, Zus tells a weeping Asael to get a hold of himself. As they sleep, their eldest brother, Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), walks up to them and wakes them up. He first admonishes Asael for not being alert, then embraces him and Aron emotionally. Zus and Tuvia have a rather curt reunion. As they walk into the forest, Zus tells Tuvia that his wife and child are hiding in a village. At night, they discuss their options. The police are after them, however they are safe in the woods. They talk about Bernicki. A friend, Koscik has a gun which they can borrow.

The broadcast showed a truck speeding so fast it went over a bridge. The","response":"astonishing scene unfolded as viewers watched in awe, witnessing the sheer momentum and force that propelled the hulking vehicle effortlessly through the air. As the truck barreled toward the bridge at breakneck speed, it was evident that the driver had either lost control or was intentionally pushing the limits of the powerful machine. The truck's tires screeched on the pavement and emitted an ear-piercing wail, as smoke billowed from the friction between the rubber and the road. This alone made it a spectacle, but what happened next was beyond belief. The truck's front end began to lift, hints of daylight peeking beneath the wheels as it approached the bridge. It seemed as if gravity itself had momentarily released its relentless pull on the massive hulk, allowing it to become air-bound. As the truck neared the apex of its ascension, tense anticipation gripped the viewers, and the collective gasp was nearly audible through the screen. Onlookers could hardly believe what they were seeing, wondering if it was a daredevil stunt or an unfortunate accident. The engine roared like a caged beast, defiantly defying the laws of physics that should have kept the vehicle grounded. The broadcasting team scrambled to keep up with the unfolding events, their voices frantic and stammering as they narrated the incredible sight. Camera lenses struggled to capture every angle of the airborne moment, zooming into the open-mouthed stares of bystanders, each of them anxiously tracking the seemingly impossible trajectory of the colossal truck. As the truck soared gracefully across the bridge, it almost resembled a gigantic steel bird spreading its wings, soaring above the earthbound chaos below. For a surreal, brief interlude, time seemed to slow, allowing all who beheld the spectacle to absorb the immense beauty and gravity of the unfolding event. And then, inevitably, gravity reasserted its control over the situation. The truck began its descent, tumbling through the air back down to earth like a metallic meteorite. As it plummeted, the crowd braced for the imminent impact, their eyes wide with morbid fascination. As the truck crashed back to the ground, a thunderous cacophony echoed throughout the scene, the deafening noise accompanied by the crunching of metal, shattering of glass, and screeching of tortured steel. The vehicle's mangled remains bore the brunt of its astonishing flight, twisted and deformed almost beyond recognition. Emergency response teams sprang into action almost instantaneously, their skill and urgency honed by countless hours of training. Police, fire, and medical personnel rushed to assess the situation, hoping desperately that the driver had somehow survived the cataclysmic event. As the dust settled and aerial drones provided overhead footage, the true magnitude of the event became clear. The unthinkable had occurred before the world's eyes, through a mixture of sheer momentum, reckless abandon, and perhaps an unconscious yearning for the freedom of flight. The broadcast would forever remain etched in the annals of history as a testament to the human spirit's ability to challenge – and momentarily conquer – the very boundaries that bind us to the earth."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and rating for the product on a scale of 1-5 based on the review.

Our world has come a long way from the early days of mankind and has fundamentally transformed the ways in which we live, work, and interact. Unfortunately, like everything else, there is a dark side to these rapid advances. Beyond the visible progress lies an invisible threat, one that permeates every aspect of our lives: cyber threats. This article will delve deep into the world of cyber threats, their origins, current state, and consequences, while also discussing methods of safeguarding against these invisible dangers. We must confront these threats head-on if we want to protect the foundations upon which our increasingly digital world is built. A Brief History of Cyber Threats The concept of a cyber threat can be traced back to the early days of the internet when hackers and cybercriminals first began to explore the potential of an interconnected digital space. They found that access to sensitive information was often poorly protected, affording opportunities to carry out various malicious activities. One of the earliest examples dates back to 1988 when the Morris Worm, one of the first worms created to specifically target vulnerabilities in computer networks, spread across the early internet and infected thousands of computers worldwide. As the internet continued to grow and efficiencies improved, so too did the complexity and breadth of the threats. Stakeholders and targets for cyber attacks expanded to include individuals, enterprises, and even entire governments. The risks posed by cyber threats evolved from mere data breaches and minor disruptions to massive global impacts with far-reaching consequences. The Current State of Cyber Threats Today, the invisible threat we face spans across nearly every digital device and platform, manifesting itself in diverse and sophisticated ways. Some of the most prevalent threats include: 1. Phishing attacks - The act of deceiving individuals with targeted emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, convincing the recipients to provide sensitive information, or download malicious software. 2. Ransomware - A type of malware that encrypts data, rendering it inaccessible, and demands a ransom for the decryption keys. 3. DDoS attacks - Distributed Denial of Service attacks overload servers or networks with excessive traffic, causing them to crash and become inaccessible to legitimate users. 4. Insider threats - Arising from individuals within organizations who deliberately misuse their access to compromise systems, steal information, or otherwise harm the organization. 5. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) - Highly sophisticated, long-lasting cyberattacks on high-value targets, frequently carried out by state-sponsored hackers. The Consequences of Ignoring The Invisible Threat The consequences of underestimating or ignoring the invisible threat are far-reaching. In the past decade alone, large-scale cyber attacks have caused billions of dollars in damages, notably impacting corporations, governmental organizations, and critical infrastructure. In 2013, the massive Target data breach saw millions of customers' personal data stolen, leading to significant financial and reputational losses. Additionally, cyber threats can jeopardize global security as certain state-sponsored actors harness these tools to influence foreign governments, disrupt elections, and destabilize nations. Combating the Invisible Threat To protect ourselves against the invisible threat, a combination of awareness, technology, and collaboration must be employed. 1. Implement strong cybersecurity frameworks - Organizations should have clearly defined cybersecurity policies, coupled with frequent security updates, vulnerability scans, and risk assessments. 2. Cybersecurity education - Regular training for employees and individuals to recognize and resist cyber threats. 3. Collaboration between governments and private entities - Formulating global cybersecurity standards and sharing essential information on potential and active threats to improve the overall security posture. 4. Continuous innovation - The development of advanced security technologies that can detect, prevent, or mitigate cyber threats. Conclusion The invisible threat, though daunting, is not insurmountable. As technology advances and our reliance on digital systems grow, so too must our commitment to defending against these threats. With a collective mindset, continued vigilance, and an adaptive approach, we can ensure the security of our digital world for generations to come."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. When will the tax plan be made law? - Before the plea deal between Michael Flynn and Mueller - Before economic growth and jobs occur due to the plan? - After the start of the Russia investigation. - not enough information A:","response":"As an AI, I am unable to predict future events with certainty.

Step 3: Analyze the public and political reaction to the tax plan - The tax plan has less than majority support from the general public. - President Trump and Republicans are eager to secure a legislative victory, which may motivate them to work faster on enacting the tax plan. - Democrats oppose the plan but currently do not have enough votes to stop it.

It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

All the Emmy love for \\"Homeland's\\" spectacular first season -- in which Danes' troubled CIA agent tried to prove that Lewis' returned prisoner of war had been turned by the enemy -- can only help build anticipation for the around-the-corner second season, slated to kick off this coming Sunday on Showtime. \\"We're all wondering what's next,\\" said Mandy Patinkin, who plays Carrie's CIA mentor, Saul. \\"What's going to happen to her? To him? To them? To the world? We're all so curious. It's wonderful. It really is a piece that second-guesses every answer, five or 10 seconds later. It's like, 'Whoa! I didn't see that coming.' \\" When the show returns, six months have lapsed since Carrie voluntarily started electroshock treatment for her bipolar condition, which caused her to lose a few crucial memories -- including one about Brody yelling out the name of a terrorist's son in his sleep. Not knowing this, the discredited Carrie has been able to let go of her obsession to prove Brody has been turned by al Qaeda and has spent her time away from the CIA living with her sister and her father, teaching ESL to adult students. Meanwhile, Brody, after deciding not to detonate a bomb to kill the vice president, has further entrenched himself into politics. Not only has Brody been elected to Congress, but he's also being vetted as a potential candidate for the next vice president, which ups the stakes in a number of ways. \\"Brody's just everybody's b**** now,\\" Lewis says with a laugh. \\"Last year, it was all about Carrie getting squeezed by her illness, her condition, and this year, it's about Brody being caught between the forces, the two sides,\\" executive producer and writer Howard Gordon said. \\"He could be more dangerous in a political position. He's asking, 'Why kill a person when I can kill an idea?' And then we wonder, does he mean that? Or is he now playing both sides?\\" Although the audience knows now whether Brody had in fact been turned and if Carrie was off-base in her suspicions, season 2 won't suffer from any loss of ambiguity, Lewis said. \\"I was concerned at first, because season 1 presented Brody as the threat, the menace of the show, while at the same time, eliciting sympathy from the audience,\\" the actor said. \\"I enjoyed the confusion of that, too. But there is more pressure this season -- more anxiety, more paranoia, more sweaty palms!\\" Even in Carrie's absence, the pressure is on the home front because Brody's wife, Jessica, is \\"no longer in the dark,\\" said Morena Baccarin, who plays Jessica. Brody's daughter Dana, who made the crucial phone call to stop Brody in the act last season, \\"knows something's not right,\\" said actress Morgan Saylor, who portrays the teen. \\"There are things that are going to come out,\\" Saylor added. \\"Carrie definitely planted a seed in her.\\" Carrie's eventual return to the CIA -- even just informally, not as an employee -- also sweats Brody's palms as he wonders whether she's back on his trail. (She's not -- at least not initially). In the first episode of the season, \\"The Smile,\\" a CIA source refuses to talk to anyone but Carrie, which causes the agency to seek her help. \\"There will be things that come out of that meeting,\\" Gordon promised. \\"And there will be battles and allegiances within the agency involved in bringing her back. There's sort of a turf war, and it's sort of incendiary.\\" The operation takes place in Beirut (but was shot in Israel), and to get into the region, Carrie changes her appearance and travels under a false ID. \\"I love Carrie as a brunette,\\" Showtime Chairman and CEO Matthew C. Blank said. \\"I told Claire, 'You're the only one who can look that hot as a blonde and a brunette in a single hour.' \\" Although she's disguised, her cover at one point gets blown -- and she gets out of the jam with an ingenious technique that signals that the Carrie of old is back. \\"She's been put through the wringer, right?\\" Danes said. \\"So I think she's starting to get some validation and the vindication she's been looking for. And I think people are rooting for her. I'm so honored to be playing her. I love her.\\" \\"The first year, we knew we had something special,\\" Patinkin said. \\"But you have to ask why: 'Why do they like it?' So in hindsight, I'd say that it hit a nerve about the longing to understand, and the lost ability to listen and understand like Carrie does.\\" Although Carrie has spent the past six months of the show not listening, and not understanding, there will come a point when she recognizes that she wasn't wrong after all, Gordon promised. \\"Carrie reconciled herself to the belief that she was wrong,\\" he said, \\"and the pieces realign and take off in a way where there's a huge reckoning. It's a season-long process,\\" building, perhaps, to a moment when Carrie and Brody finally meet up again. (Or so it seems from the previews, which also suggest a blood-covered Brody burying a body. But as everyone involved with the show cautions, \\"It's not what you think it is.\\") \\"The season really is about how does the Carrie-Brody story pan out,\\" Gordon said. \\"There's a lot more to come, but those two, whenever Carrie and Brody are on-screen together, it's amazing. The screen just explodes.\\" Highlights:","response":"1. \\"Homeland\\" wins four Emmy Awards, including outstanding drama series, writing for a drama series, lead actor for Damian Lewis, and lead actress for Claire Danes.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. Now, I have a new situation: In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone. Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. Answer this question please: Was the water table in increased or decreased level in northeast Michigan during sixteenth century? A:","response":"In the sixteenth century, the state of Michigan was densely forested with an abundance of elm and oak trees. However, during the twentieth century, vegetation clearance and replacement of the wooded areas with farmlands significantly changed the landscape and ecosystem in northeast Michigan. Heavy irrigation became a common practice in these farmlands. The water table is influenced by various factors, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and human activities like irrigation and vegetation clearance. In the sixteenth century, northeast Michigan's landscape was dominated by forests, which play a crucial role in maintaining and regulating the water table. Forests, especially deep-rooted trees like elms and oaks, facilitate the process of evapotranspiration. This process, along with influxes of precipitation, helps to maintain a stable, deep water table, thus preventing the occurrence of shallow groundwater and salinization. However, the twentieth-century transformation of northeast Michigan witnessed an increase in human-induced changes to the landscape. Vegetation clearance for farmlands and heavy irrigation might have significantly altered the water table in the region. The removal of forests could have decreased the rate at which water is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. Coupled with this change, heavy irrigation in farmlands likely resulted in an increase in the local water table. Increased water table levels can lead to the mobilization of salts, which can have detrimental effects on the ecosystem, as mentioned in the background information. This process can result in increased soil salinization which reduces water uptake in plants and ultimately contributes to the decline of elm and oak populations in northeast Michigan. Therefore, while the actual data for water table levels from the sixteenth century in northeast Michigan might be unavailable, based on the potential change in the factors affecting the water table after the twentieth-century landscape changes, it is likely that the water table was at a more stable and deeper level in the sixteenth century than it was in the twentieth century following human-induced alterations like vegetation clearance and heavy irrigation practices."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

Nur der Mensch alleine lebt nach seinen selbst erschaffenen Zeitstandards. Translate to English English:","response":"The fact is that the rest of life on Earth, commonly referred to as the biosphere, lives in the rhythm of natural time. Only humans alone live according to their self-created time standards. This statement highlights the difference between how human society has adapted to measure and segment time as compared to the rest of the living organisms on Earth. The biosphere, which consists of all the ecosystems on our planet, functions based on natural cycles and processes. These include the day-night cycle, the changing of seasons, and the various stages of life for plants and animals. Humans, on the other hand, have established a more complex system of measuring and organizing time in order to facilitate social, economic, and personal functioning. This system comprises units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. The use of calendars and clocks allows us to keep track of time in a standardized and organized manner, enabling the smooth functioning of our societies. Historically, early human societies lived according to the natural rhythms of the sun and moon, much like the other species on Earth. However, as we developed more advanced methods of agriculture, communication, and transportation, it became necessary to create a standardized system of timekeeping that would be globally recognized and accepted. One major development in timekeeping was the advent of mechanical clocks, which allowed for greater accuracy and uniformity in the measurement of time. Later, advancements such as electronic clocks, quartz crystals, and atomic clocks further improved the precision of timekeeping. Today, we rely on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as the basis for our time zones and standards. Despite the benefits of our standardized time system, there are also potential drawbacks to this approach. Living according to artificial time parameters can lead to a disconnection from the natural world and its rhythms, which may have negative implications for our well-being. As we spend our lives adhering to strict schedules and deadlines, we may lose touch with the cycles and patterns that govern the rest of the living organisms on Earth. A possible solution to balance the benefits of organized timekeeping and awareness of natural rhythms is to ensure that we intentionally engage with the natural world and appreciate its patterns. This can be achieved through activities such as gardening, hiking, birdwatching, or simply spending time in nature, as these pursuits help us to reconnect with the Earth's natural rhythms. In conclusion, while it is true that humans have established their own unique time standards, it is essential to recognize the importance of staying in tune with the natural rhythms of the biosphere. This balance between artificial time and natural time can potentially enhance our overall well-being and enable us to maintain a healthy relationship with the world around us."},{"question":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Perhaps the most important thing you need to know when measuring your blood pressure are key target levels.

WSVN -- Celina has five brothers and sisters. But two of her brothers are very special. Celina Aarons: \\"They can't talk, they are mute deaf. No sounds, no nothing. They make sounds but they can't talk.\\" Both young men were born deaf. Shamir is the younger one, and Celina is especially close to him. Celina Aarons: \\"And he's a sweetheart and he goes to college and I would do anything for him.\\" Since Shamir is in college and doesn't work, Celina got him a phone and put it on her plan. Then last month, she got their phone bill. Celina Aarons: \\"Yes to 201,000 dollars, over 201,000 dollars. I asked three, four times and I'm like oh my God are you serious and she's like yes.\\" Yes. A monthly phone bill that is normally 175 was 201,005.44. Celina Aarons: \\"I was freaking out. I was shaking, crying, I couldn't even talk that much on the phone. I was like my life is over!\\" This is the 201,000 bill, running 43 pages. When Shamir saw it, he couldn't believe he had run it up. Celina Aarons: \\"He spent two weeks in Canada. There is no way its that high. He was in shock. No way.\\" Shamir had been on vacation in Canada where he didn't turn his data roaming off. Texting over 2,000 times and using the phone to download videos. Bringing this charge for 1,800. This one for 1,300 this one for 2,500. On and on and on. Celina Aarons signs to Shamir: \\"Did you leave it on when you go to see movies. On or off?\\" Celina Aarons: \\"So apparently he used it for internet and I don't know how the charges got so high or whatever.\\" Since Shamir is on Celina's phone plan, the 201,000 bill is her responsibility. But she says paying that's impossible. Celina Aarons: \\"Well it's never going to get paid cause therefore, I cant pay that. That's like paying a nice house right now based on what houses are going for.\\" She argues, the phone company should have told her the bill was blowing up. Celina Aarons: \\"Wouldn't you let me know as the primary holder and they are saying no we respect your privacy. What privacy? That is my account.\\" Now she is faced with this- a phone bill very few people could pay in a lifetime, much less a month. Celina Aarons: \\"Oh my God, my future is done, that's it. That all i can think about. My life is over. I can't do nothing, it's done.\\" Well Howard, data roaming charges can soar if you are out of the country. But legally does a company have to notify you your bill is breaking a record? Howard Finkelstein: \\"No they do not. Their job is to provide a service and to bill you accurately. If you intentionally or in this case accidentally, run up a huge bill, legally you have to pay for it.\\" We then contacted T-mobile. Give them enormous credit, they were reasonable. They wrote that Shamir was billed 10 per megabyte. They say that rate was texted to him, and four additional texts were sent to his phone as the charges soared. T-mobile then did what they legally didn't have to do. They lowered Celina's phone bill from 201,000 to 2,500 and even gave her six months to pay that bill. Patrick Fraser: \\"Celina still has a big phone bill, and an even bigger story to tell people who all say the same thing when she tells them about her 201,000.\\" Celina Aarons: \\"You're joking right?\\" It's no joke. But fortunately the bill is a whole lot lower. Shamir signs: \\"Thank you sir.\\" You are welcome Shamir. Patrick Fraser: \\"Phone companies tell you when you leave the country. turn that data roaming off. T-mobile says they warned Shamir, but I guess when you are sending and receiving 2,000 texts you can miss the warnings. And what happened to Shamir is not uncommon.

I was shaking, crying, I couldn't even talk that much on the phone. I was like my life is over!\\" The woman tells WSVN-TV about her reaction to the mammoth bill. Apparently what had happened was that her brother had not turned the data roaming off on his phone during his trip to Canada. More than 2,000 texts and a number of downloaded videos later and — at 10/megabyte — you end up with a phone bill larger than many mortgages. While T-Mobile says it sent several texts to the brother alerting him of the rates, the sister believes she should have been given a heads-up at some point before things got into six-digit territory. \\"Wouldn't you let me know as the primary holder and they are saying no we respect your privacy.

Context: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intra-aortic filter on postoperative outcomes in high-risk cardiac surgical patients.', 'An intra-aortic filter was used in 316 (4.9%) of 6442 cardiac surgical cases from 2003 to 2013. A retrospective analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) registry data was performed for 204 patients with filter placement who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 89), valve replacement (n = 63) or combined CABG and valve replacement (n = 52), matched with 1224 patients without filter placement by STS mortality scores based on propensity scores. Generalized linear modelling was used to compare rates of complications as well as the length of stay and time in the intensive care unit (ICU). A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.', 'Overall, patients with filters before matching had a significantly higher risk of death than did the patients without filters: 12.0% of patients with filters had an STS mortality risk score ≥4 vs 7.7% of patients without filters (P = 0.027). After analysis of the composite end-point of all STS major morbidities, the matched filter group had fewer overall complications (6.8 vs 13.2%, P = 0.02). The rate of postoperative respiratory failure was lower in the filter group (2.5 vs 7.0%, P = 0.01). Rates of stroke and new-onset haemodialysis, while not statistically different, were almost 50% lower in the filter group. Length of stay in the hospital and in the ICU was not significantly different; however, in patients with postoperative complications, time in the ICU (163 vs 189 h, P = 0.02) was shorter for the filter patients.Question: Does selective use of the intra-aortic filter in high-risk cardiac surgical patients lead to better postoperative outcomes?

His mother, Bow-sim Mark, is a Fu Style Wudangquan (internal martial arts) and Tai Chi grandmaster, while his father, Klyster Yen (Zhen Yun Long ), is a newspaper editor. When he was two years old, his family moved to Hong Kong and then to Boston when he was 11. His younger sister, Chris Yen, is also a martial artist and actress, and appeared in the 2007 film Adventures of Johnny Tao: Rock Around the Dragon. Context: Donnie Yen was a rebel when he was young due to the huge expectations and pressures from his parents, as his mother is the founder of the Chinese Wushu Research Institute in Boston, and his father was a scholar and a musician. Yen joined a Chinatown gang in Boston, MA, in his early years. He was a very curious teenager who sought to exchange martial arts knowledge with people from different martial arts backgrounds, which led to him gaining profound knowledge in practical martial arts and having a reputation as a street brawler. One reported occasion confirms Yen as being an efficient martial artist. According to news reports by Hong Kong news channels in the late 1990s, Yen was at a nightclub with his then girlfriend, Joey Meng. Inside the nightclub, Joey was harassed by a troublesome gang that had taken an interest in her. Yen warned them to leave her alone, but they persisted to cause trouble. As Yen and Joey left the club, the gang followed and attacked Yen. Yen beat up eight members of the gang who were later hospitalized. Malaysian Martial Arts Star Michelle Yeoh has said that Donnie Yen is the fastest guy she has worked with. Other martial arts stars such as Jackie Chan and Jet Li have also stated that Yen may be the best fighter in terms of practical combat in the Asian cinematic universe.

First and foremost, they enthusiastically express their belief that it could not possibly be a better thing, suggesting a high level of satisfaction and enjoyment from their experience. This conviction stems from their personal appreciation of the event and could be influenced by various factors, such as the quality and content of the event itself, its uniqueness, or the impact it had on them emotionally or intellectually. Furthermore, the speaker emphasizes that the event is free, which opens up accessibility for a broader audience. The lack of financial barriers often attracts more people to take part in an experience that they might not have considered otherwise. It is evident that the speaker sees significant value in the event, given that they find it to be an excellent opportunity worth attending despite the absence of any monetary cost. Another key factor that the speaker highlights is the event's location at the Hayward, which could be a prominent or well-known venue in London. This information adds a layer of credibility to the event, as it is associated with a respected location. For those in London, the familiarity and convenience of the venue could encourage individuals to consider attending the event without requiring extensive travel or additional planning. Additionally, the speaker recognizes that the event might be available on tour and encourages those who might have the opportunity to attend when it comes near them in the future. This implies that the event has a level of demand and appreciation beyond the current location and that people outside of London should not miss out on the chance to experience it.

The reason for the partial truth of the second sentence lies in the information shared by the first sentence. Both sentences describe a man wearing a beige shirt, making this aspect of the statement true. However, the second sentence provides additional details (i.e. the man is walking down a street) which are not mentioned in the first sentence. Since there is not enough information from the first sentence to ascertain whether the man is indeed walking down a street, we cannot confirm the full accuracy of the statement. The absence of information in a statement cannot outrightly be considered as a contradiction; rather, it leaves room for interpretation. Furthermore, the second sentence does not mention the black hat and sunglasses described in the first sentence. However, since it does not directly contradict those aspects, the sentence can still be seen as partially true. In conclusion, the sentence \\"A man is walking down a street, wearing a beige shirt.\\" can be partially true, as it aligns with the description of the man wearing a beige shirt provided in the first sentence. Nevertheless, the lack of information concerning the man's location and the absence of the hat and sunglasses details render the sentence incompletely accurate."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Markets get caught in self-perpetuating cycles of undue optimism and hysterical panic.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The cycles repeat every five years.\\" true?","response":"Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis The premise states that markets go through cycles of optimism and panic, which likely refers to market booms and busts. The hypothesis suggests that these cycles repeat every five years. Step 2: Gather relevant data To confirm or refute the hypothesis, we would need to collect market data, specifically related to the timing and frequency of market booms and busts over a significant period. Step 3: Analyze the data Once we have the necessary data, we can analyze it and determine if there is a pattern to these cycles that repeats every five years. We would look at the time intervals between market booms and busts and see if the frequency matches the hypothesis. Step 4: Draw a conclusion If our analysis shows that the intervals between booms and busts consistently occur every five years, the hypothesis is supported. However, if the intervals are inconsistent and show no clear pattern, the hypothesis is unlikely to be true. In reality, market cycles are quite complex and influenced by various factors such as economic policies, investor sentiment, and global events. Due to these factors, it is unlikely that a fixed pattern of market cycles every five years can be universally true."},{"question":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Romania.

A hand is seen paddling in the water along with the front of the canoe the person paddling is in, the body and face are not visible, however. the canoe","response":"glides smoothly through the water, leaving a gentle ripple behind it. As the sun peers through the canopy of trees, its rays glimmer on the surface of the water, casting a mesmerizing dance of light. The atmosphere is calm, peaceful, and full of life as the sounds of nature echo through the dense foliage on either side of the canoe's path. The birds are singing sweet melodies to one another, and in the distance, a deer tentatively emerges amongst the greenery to take a cautious drink from the water's edge, keeping a watchful eye on its surroundings. The mysterious paddler, still only visible from the shoulder down, continues to skillfully navigate the canoe down the winding river. A closer look reveals that the paddler is wearing a weathered, yet well-loved, flannel shirt with rolled-up sleeves, implying that they have a strong connection to nature and are no stranger to outdoor adventures. As the canoe continues its journey, the paddler maneuvers around rock formations, fallen trees, and other natural obstacles with apparent ease. The rhythmic motion of the paddle entering and exiting the water creates a soothing, hypnotic sound that seems to harmonize with the symphony of the surrounding forest. Around a bend in the river, the scene opens up to reveal an idyllic clearing on the bank, dotted with vibrant wildflowers and a smattering of various foliage. Rays of sunlight find their way through the canopy above and warm the ground, inviting creatures to come bask and frolic in the sun. The air is scented with the fragrance of damp earth and blossoming flora mingling together in the perfect embrace of unity. The paddler eases the canoe to a gentle stop along the bank and finally steps out, allowing the sun's warm light to envelop their face and reveal their features for the first time. They have weathered, yet kind eyes that hold a quiet wisdom gained from countless voyages like this one. The paddler takes a moment to breathe in the calm serenity of the scene before them before untying the small pack they had fastened to the canoe's bow. Expertly and purposefully, they begin to set up a quaint but efficient campsite. Unfurling a worn but sturdy tent, gathering fallen branches for firewood, and arranging stones for a makeshift fire pit, the paddler shows they have clearly set up camp many times before. The sun slowly sets as a fire is sparked, painting the sky with hues of pink and orange while the aroma of a simple, yet nourishing, meal being cooked drifts through the campsite, only adding to the sense of comfort, hearth, and belonging. As the stars begin to emerge, twinking like a million tiny fireflies in the sky, the paddler settles down on a smoothed log beside the fire. They pull out a small notebook and pen, and in the flickering light, they begin to write. Perhaps they're documenting this journey, recalling the beauty and serenity of the scenery, or sharing their thoughts and insights learned from a life spent embracing nature. They write peacefully late into the night, fueled by the primal whispers of the wilderness all around them. As the fire dwindles to embers and the night sky has fully revealed its celestial wonders, the paddler finally retires to the tent for a night of well-earned rest, surrounded by the comforting embrace of nature. The next morning, the canoeist will awaken to experience another day of exploration and wonder, guided by the river's ever-flowing current and the boundless beauty of the interconnected web of life."},{"question":"Combine that with her losing my flowers I asked her to hold while I carried her stuff to the car today , and I ' m afraid I ' m not too happy with her at the moment , much though I love her .

Choices: - crowding - wonder - being bored - fear - sore feet The rationale to choose \\"wonder\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"When visiting a museum, a child may experience a range of emotions and physical sensations, such as crowding, wonder, being bored, fear, and sore feet. Among these possibilities, \\"wonder\\" stands out as the most positive and profound emotion that a child might encounter during a museum visit. Museums play a significant role in expanding a child's mind and enriching their knowledge about various aspects of life, including history, art, science, and culture. Here's why \\"wonder\\" serves as the dominant overarching experience that a child can have at a museum. 1. Exposure to new and fascinating subjects: Museums offer an opportunity for children to discover a world beyond their everyday experiences. Whether it's marveling at dinosaur skeletons, ancient artifacts, or impressive works of art, a museum can open the door to new interests and ideas that the child might not have encountered elsewhere. This exposure to new and captivating subjects can evoke a strong sense of wonder and intrigue in a child's mind. 2. Immersive and interactive exhibits: Many museums have specifically designed exhibits that provide hands-on experiences or interactive features, which allow children to engage with the subject matter and learn more about a topic they find fascinating. This immersive and interactive approach often inspires curiosity, leading children to raise questions, seek answers, and continue to be captivated by the wonders of the museum. 3. Inspiring role models and stories: Museums often showcase stories of remarkable people and their achievements throughout history, from groundbreaking inventions to revolutionary movements. As a child learns about these inspiring figures and events, they may develop a sense of wonder about the potential of humans to achieve great things, which can, in turn, motivate them to explore their own interests and talents. 4. Opportunities for family bonding and shared experiences: A museum visit offers an excellent platform for parents and caregivers to bond with their children over shared experiences while exploring new knowledge. Witnessing the wonder in their children's eyes and nurturing their curiosity can create lasting memories that strengthen family relationships. 5. Museums as informal educational environments: Unlike traditional educational settings, museums offer an informal learning environment where children can explore at their own pace and follow their interests. This freedom and self-direction can instill a sense of wonder, inspiring children to make connections between their lives and the broader context of the world around them. While all the aforementioned emotions and sensations can be experienced by a child during a visit to a museum, the experience of \\"wonder\\" stands out as the most positive and transformative feeling that a child may encounter. Museums provide a unique space where children can be inspired, learn, and grow in ways that extend beyond their everyday experiences, ultimately igniting a sense of wonder that can foster a lifelong love of learning."},{"question":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

There were billions of these particles, and they can be found all around us – in the air, water, and even inside our own bodies. To do its job, Tachyon II had to pretend that it was working with 374 billion of these little particles. That's a number so big that if you tried to count them, it would take more than a lifetime just to say all the numbers out loud. Tachyon II was really fast, but because it had to think about so many particles, it still took 20 whole days to finish its work! That's almost three weeks of non-stop computing! In the end, Tachyon II completed its task, and the people who built it were very proud. They learned a lot from the work that Tachyon II did and can use that knowledge to make even better computers in the future.

Article: Much has been said and written recently about heroes, mainly because many people think we have too few of them. There are many different kinds of heroes, but they all seem to have two things in common. First, heroes, by their actions, show the great possibilities of human nature. Second, heroes can also stand the test of time, and their achievements will not be easily forgotten. Because of these good points, we need to choose our heroes carefully. Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who is believed to be a hero, warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes. She hopes that if someone tries to copy her, it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard. Joyner-Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person's life. Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good. A hero should show politeness, courage, patience, and strength all the time. A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world, even if only in small ways. Author Daniel Boorstin suggests that, \\" _ are people who make news, but heroes are people who make history.\\" Thus, if a person is truly worthy to be called a hero, he or she will not be soon forgotten. We all need heroes. We need to be able to respect people who have been there, done that, and succeeded. Many times the greatest heroes are the people we deal with every day -- relatives , friends, and neighbors -- who will keep going when it is easier to give up. The parent who puts her or his family ahead of herself or himself, the teacher who will make more money at another job but chooses to help others -- all these people can be considered as heroes. A hero quietly and continuously sets a good example, an example that inspires others to follow. Question: Joyner-Kersee hopes that young people _ .

More than 280 years after it was damaged in a fire, one of the original copies of the Magna Carta is legible again. Written in 1215, the Magna Carta required the king of England — King John — to cede absolute power. Today, the Magna Carta is seen as a first step toward constitutional law rather than the hereditary power of royalty. There were four copies of the document created at the time. One, held by the British Library, was badly damaged in a fire in 1731. Now, researchers have used a technique called multispectral imaging to decipher the text of the \\"Burnt Magna Carta\\" without touching or further damaging the delicate parchment. This imaging allowed conservation scientists to take pictures of the document that virtually erase the damage and show details of the parchment and text. \\"It was in such a terrible state, we couldn't read any of it, really,\\" said Christina Duffy, a British Library imaging scientist. \\"It was actually quite a surprise that so much text was recovered.\\" [See Images of the Recovered Magna Carta Text] Damaged document The imaging is part of the preparations for the 800th anniversary of the sealing of the Magna Carta, when King John imprinted his royal seal on the document and was bound by oath to abide by its demands. The British Library holds two of the original copies of the Magna Carta from 1215, including the burnt version. The other two copies are held at Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral. On Feb. 3, 2015, the four copies will be displayed side-by-side at the British Library in London for the first time ever. The public can enter a lottery for free tickets to the viewing, which will be available to 1,215 winners. Registration is available on the British Library website. The Burnt Magna Carta has not been examined for decades, Duffy told Live Science. In the 1970s, it was set in a very secure frame, she said. That out-of-date frame has been removed in anticipation of the February 2015 anniversary, giving scientists the chance to get a closer look at the document. Revisiting the text The British Library team had no interest in trying to restore the smoke-damaged document, Duffy said, but wanted to preserve it as-is. \\"There are different ways you can treat it,\\" she said. \\"But a lot of them would be wet processes, so you might have to dampen certain areas, and we don't want to introduce any moisture at all to the charter.\\" Instead, the scientists used multispectral imaging, essentially photographing the burnt parchment in a variety of LED lights, spanning the spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared — outside the range of human vision. \\"If you're interested in the ink, the ultraviolet light gives you the best information. If you are interested in the actual texture of the parchment itself, the infrared would be better,\\" Duffy said. \\"You end up with multiple images of essentially the same thing, but giving you different information.\\" In these images, text that is invisible to the naked eye is suddenly visible. The Burnt Magna Carta is basically identical in text to the other three copies from 1215, Duffy said. The team is still processing the multispectral imagery and will conduct the same process on other old documents related to the Magna Carta, she said. Both the British Library's original Magna Carta manuscripts will be displayed between March 13, 2015 and Sept. 1, 2015, in an exhibit called \\"Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy.\\" Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+.

Photograph: British Library The four surviving copies of the original Magna Carta from 1215 will come together for the first time in history next February as part of a one-off event to mark the 800th anniversary of the signing of the historic document. The Magna Carta – literally, Great Charter – was issued by King John in 1215, as his barons revolted and civil war loomed. It saw the monarch avert crisis by acknowledging that the king was not above the law, and with the granting of a range of rights to English citizens. “To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice,” runs one of its most famous clauses. Written on single sheets of parchment, running to around 4,000 words of medieval Latin, two of the surviving 1215 Magna Carta documents are kept at the British Library – one of which was severely damaged in an 18th-century fire, and which has been painstakingly restored using multispectral imaging. One is currently at Lincoln Cathedral, and one at Salisbury Cathedral. On 3 February 2015, they will be brought together at the British Library. “It’s not just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity – this is the first time in history this will happen,” said Julian Harrison, curator of medieval manuscripts at the British Library. “The documents which survive were all written by different scribes – we know this because of the different handwriting. And as each was finished, it would have been sent out to various recipients ... We don’t know how many would have been originally drawn up and sent out – I’d imagine relatively small numbers. Only four survive.” Known as the “Burnt Magna Carta”, one of the four copies of the charter was burned in the Cotton library fire of 1731. Attempts to restore it subsequently made it even more difficult to read, but now conservators and scientists at the British Library have used new techniques to virtually peel away the layers of damage affecting the manuscript, and make its text readable for the first time in centuries. “It’s absolutely astonishing. It’s been unable to be read with the naked eye for 200-plus years,” said Harrison. “We couldn’t have done this even three or four years ago – it’s very exciting ... We knew what the text was going to say, but it is just being able to see the original medieval handwriting. It was clearly a beautiful manuscript in its heyday.” Each of the documents is “slightly different”, added Harrison. “It’s what you would expect if something was copied out by hand.” The British Library described the Magna Carta as “one of the world’s most influential documents”, saying that in the centuries since it was signed, it has “become a potent symbol of liberty and the rule of law”. It is offering just 1,215 people from around the world the chance to view the four documents side by side on 3 February 2015, via a ballot. Winners of the free ballot will be greeted by the historian Dan Jones, and subsequently, “to the sound of live medieval music ... will be taken by costumed characters from the 13th century to view the four original Magna Carta manuscripts on display together for the first time”, said the institution. The Lincoln and Salisbury copies will then return to their home institutions for further, separate exhibitions. “It’s fair to say it is one of the most famous documents in the world,” said Harrison. “It has this global significance. Nelson Mandela cites it, as does Thomas More; it influenced Thomas Jefferson as he drew up the Declaration of Independence; it influenced the universal declaration of human rights. And what’s most remarkable about it is that some of its clauses are still valid in English law. Those who drew it up in 1215 would have had no expectations that it would last beyond a few months, but it still resonates today.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"British Library scientists have used ultraviolet light to photograph the text of the 1215 Burnt Magna Carta, which was invisible to the human eye.

The first season had 12 episodes, and every season after that had 50% more episodes except the last season, which had 24 episodes. The show had 5 seasons. How much did it cost to produce all the episodes? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To calculate the total cost of producing all the episodes for the TV show, consider the following reasons: 1. The first season had 12 episodes and each episode cost 100,000. Therefore, the total cost for the first season is 12 * 100,000 = 1,200,000. 2. Subsequent seasons (season 2, 3, 4, and 5) cost twice as much per episode, so 100,000 * 2 = 200,000 per episode. 3. Each season after the first had 50% more episodes than the previous season, except the last season, which had 24 episodes. To calculate the number of episodes in each season: Season 2: 12 episodes in season 1 * 1.5 = 18 episodes. Season 3: 18 episodes in season 2 * 1.5 = 27 episodes. Season 4: 27 episodes in season 3 * 1.5 = 40.5 episodes. However, since we cannot have half an episode, we can round this number down to 40 episodes (assuming the show creators decided to remove half an episode to fit the season into 40 episodes). Season 5: 24 episodes, as mentioned in the problem. 4. Calculate the cost for each season with the 200,000 per episode cost: Season 2: 18 episodes * 200,000 = 3,600,000 Season 3: 27 episodes * 200,000 = 5,400,000 Season 4: 40 episodes * 200,000 = 8,000,000 Season 5: 24 episodes * 200,000 = 4,800,000 5. Now, add up the costs of all five seasons: 1,200,000 (season 1) + 3,600,000 (season 2) + 5,400,000 (season 3) + 8,000,000 (season 4) + 4,800,000 (season 5) = 23,000,000 So, the total cost to produce all the episodes for the TV show was 23,000,000."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on Šime vrsaljko 's: - caps - nationalyears - youthclubs - ntupdate - birth date - clubs - nationalcaps - currentclub - caption - height - nationalgoals - name - nationalteam - birth place - position - fullname - image size - years - clubnumber - youthyears - pcupdate - image - goals Bio: Šime vrsaljko -lrb- ; born 10 january 1992 -rrb- is a croatian professional footballer who plays as a right back for sassuolo and the croatian national team . his preferred position is at right back , but he can also play as a left back , or in midfield .

After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman. The police had arrived to investigate the theft of the box's remains and the blood left behind from the killing of the foreman. Failing to stop, the handyman died in a hail of police bullets. Once his head and body are joined, Gideon will be fully able to exercise his powers over all comers. The young woman is aware of the evil and is protected from the head's influence by an ancient cross she wears around her neck, but when her boyfriend removes it, to make a cast so its historical value could be appraised, the head takes control of her mind. So, ironically, though the guest under control of the head was unable to remove it, Jessica was put in harms way by her protector. Jessica then helps find the head's body, previously being against doing so since they only wished to make money out of it as well as fear that it was an evil business. The young woman joins head to body and Gideon arises from his coffin, but the boyfriend, aware of the error of his ways, catches the monster... The answer to this question is:","response":"Jessica takes off her cross because her boyfriend, Gordon, wants to make a cast of it in order to appraise its historical value. Unknowingly, this action puts Jessica in a vulnerable position, as the ancient cross she wears around her neck serves as a protective barrier against the evil influence of Gideon Drew's head. When the cross is removed, Gideon is able to take control of her mind. The irony in this situation lies in the fact that the person who was trying to protect Jessica, her boyfriend Gordon, ultimately places her in harm's way. This incident serves as a turning point in the movie, putting Jessica in direct contact with the evil forces she had been trying to avoid. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of the cross as a powerful symbol and protective charm against dark powers. In conclusion, the removal of Jessica's cross is a pivotal moment in the movie \\"The Thing That Couldn't Die,\\" as it not only exposes her to Gideon Drew's evil influence but also reveals the importance of ancient artifacts and their connection to historical events and beliefs. It shows that even with good intentions, actions can sometimes have unintended consequences and that knowledge about ancient artifacts' potential effects can be crucial for protecting against unforeseen dangers."},{"question":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.","response":"Title: Exceptional Performance and Seamless Integration - A Comprehensive 5-Star Experience!

Katrina tried to mold Natalie in the type of person they wanted them to be, because Select from: 1). Katrina was too controlling.. 2). Natalie was too controlling..","response":"1). Katrina was too controlling. Katrina tried to mold Natalie in the type of person they wanted them to be, because Katrina was too controlling. Possessing an insatiable need for power and dominance over others in her life, Katrina's overbearing nature compelled her to suppress the unique qualities of those around her, preferring instead to create a world with people who fit her ideal image. This toxic behavior stifled the individuality and personal growth of everyone in her social circle, gravely affecting Natalie the most. As the two became friends, Katrina recognized Natalie's open and friendly nature, which she saw as an opportunity to project her own beliefs and desires onto her. Consciously or unconsciously, Katrina began to manipulate and dominate every aspect of Natalie's life. From dressing to social interactions, she placed her intense focus on modifying Natalie's behavior and choices, priding herself in the role of the puppet master. However, this excessive control came with consequences. Silent resentment festered within Natalie as she lost control not only of her external affairs, but also of her sense of self and personal identity. Desperate to break free from Katrina's grasp, she began planning her escape from this toxic friendship. Ironically, Katrina's desperate attempts at exerting control only served to distance her from the friends and relationships she valued. As her world slowly crumbled around her, she found herself increasingly isolated and powerless - a bitter pill to swallow for someone who thought she held dominion over others. In the end, the lesson Katrina would take away from this experience was that true friendship isn't born from a desire to control or change another person, but rather from the appreciation of their unique qualities and the mutual support and encouragement offered in times of both triumph and struggle. Unfortunately for Katrina, this realization came too late, and the damage to her relationship with Natalie was already done. To recover and grow from this, Katrina would need to recognize not only her toxic behaviors but also her underlying emotions that drove this desire for control. Therapy, self-reflection, and a genuine effort to show empathy and understanding towards others might be the first steps in that direction. Perhaps only then would she be able to foster genuine, meaningful relationships free from manipulation and control."},{"question":"1. The white spur is cylindrical and curved upward , longer than the ovary . 2. The cylindrical spur is curved white and upward , longer than the ovar . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, as they convey the same meaning using different word orders and slight variations in phrasing. Let's analyze each sentence and break it down to understand the similarities and differences in their structure and phrasing. Sentence 1: \\"The white spur is cylindrical and curved upward, longer than the ovary.\\" Sentence 2: \\"The cylindrical spur is curved white and upward, longer than the ovar.\\" In both sentences, the main subject being described is a spur. There are four key properties that are described about the spur in each sentence: 1. It is white. 2. It is cylindrical. 3. It is curved upward. 4. It is longer than the ovary (note that there is a typo in the second sentence - \\"ovar\\" should be \\"ovary\\"). In Sentence 1, the color of the spur is mentioned before its shape, whereas in Sentence 2, the shape is mentioned before the color. Additionally, in Sentence 2, the words \\"curved\\" and \\"white\\" are used adjacently, making it a bit ambiguous whether they both describe the spur or if \\"curved\\" only refers to the upward direction. However, given the overall context, it can be safely inferred that both \\"white\\" and \\"curved\\" are intended to describe the spur in Sentence 2, just like they are explicitly connected in Sentence 1. Despite these differences in structure, the meaning of the two sentences is still the same. Both sentences convey the idea that there is a white, cylindrical spur that curves upward and is longer than an ovary. As a result, we can consider these sentences as paraphrases of each other."},{"question":"Article: Before Christmas Mr Smith broke his right leg and had to stay in hospital.

Credit: NOAA Debris handling guidelines offer advice on what to do with debris like this soccer ball. Credit: David Baxter Does the debris still look like this? NOAA's Frequently Asked Questions and answers explain. Credit: US Navy On March 11, 2011, a devastating 9.0 earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. The disaster claimed nearly 16,000 lives, injured 6,000, and destroyed or damaged countless buildings. As a result of the disaster, NOAA expects a portion of the debris that the tsunami washed into the ocean to reach U.S. and Canadian shores over the next several years. NOAA is leading efforts with federal, state, and local partners to collect data, assess the debris, and reduce possible impacts to our natural resources and coastal communities. There is no reason to avoid beaches. Radiation experts believe it is highly unlikely any debris is radioactive, and the debris is not in a mass. Beachgoers may notice an increase in debris near-shore or on the coast, adding to the marine debris that washes up every day. The public should continue to visit and enjoy our coasts—and help keep them clean. View Frequently Asked Questions ||||| Story highlights Last year's earthquake and tsunami sent tons of debris into Pacific Ocean A portion of that headed east for Alaska, Hawaii, West Coast Officials are receiving reports of items coming ashore It's difficult to predict exactly the path First came the stuff that floats on the surface and is pushed by wind: Buoys, a soccer ball, flotation devices. And, most notably, a rust-stained unmanned fishing trawler in Alaskan waters. Communities in Alaska, Hawaii, the West Coast and Canada are preparing for the main event from debris pushed offshore by last year's massive Japanese earthquake and tsunami. About 70% of the debris sank, according to Japanese government estimates. No one knows how much of the remaining 1.5 million tons of debris is still floating in the Pacific Ocean. But U.S. and state officials say that some items washing ashore may be from the disaster, which took place 13 months ago and nearly 5,000 miles away. Thousands of people were killed. \\"Our models show the outer edge of the debris is at the West Coast and Alaska now,\\" Nancy Wallace, program director and division chief of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Debris Program, said Wednesday. The bulk of the debris is north of Hawaii, slowly moving east. Just Watched Coast Guard shells 'ghost ship' replay More Videos ... Coast Guard shells 'ghost ship' 00:45 PLAY VIDEO In Washington state, there have been reports of lumber, lightbulbs and fishing items reaching land. Their source has not been confirmed. Officials can't rule out they came from the tsunami, according to Curt Hart, communications manager at the the state's Department of Ecology. A volunteer helping in a beach cleanup this weekend along the Washington coast said she found items that appeared to include Japanese writing, according to CNN Seattle affiliate KING. That doesn't prove they were part of the tsunami debris, officials caution. NOAA said there is no current \\"debris field.\\" Rather, items, large and small, are scattered over a huge swath of the North Pacific and may make landfall intermittently. Residents are being told to expect reports of debris to increase and continue over the next couple of years. What might they see? For starters, building materials, fishing nets and gear, plastic, barrels and hazardous materials. Federal, state and local officials held a workshop in Ocean Shores, Washington, on Wednesday, to discuss strategies for handling additional debris. The workshop followed a round of meetings in Washington communities. \\"I think my folks have heard a little bit of everything at these meetings,\\" said Tim Church, communications director for the Washington State Department of Health. \\"The great majority who have come have been low-key about it.\\" Some people have asked whether any bodies will come ashore. That's not expected. The top concern is whether radioactive material from the Fukushima nuclear power plant will make landfall. NOAA has said that scenario is highly unlikely. \\"We do not expect to see anything to wash up from Japan with elevated levels of radiation,\\" said Church. \\"At the same time, we fully appreciate the concern of people. If you spend a lot of time on the coast, if you see the news coverage, you want to see you are safe.\\" A beach cleanup this past weekend along the Washington shore included checks with radiation-detecting equipment, according to Church. \\"There just had not been anything so far.\\" No single government agency is in charge of patrolling and cleaning beaches; hence the planning and public information campaign. \\"We are poised ... with a well-coordinated response,\\" said Hart of the state ecology department. \\"We are going to see items from the tsunami on our beaches.\\" Of concern for his agency is the potential for oil or chemical drums or fuel cylinders to come ashore. That risk could increase as the region sees normal stormy weather kick up later this year, according to Hart. The U.S. Coast Guard is focusing on pollution threats and any impediments to navigation, according to Lt. Regina Caffrey, a public affairs officer in Washington state. Lynne Talley, a physical oceanographer with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said the debris was initially carried on the swift Kuroshio current, but slowed as it joined another current west of Hawaii. \\"It is now scattered over 4,000 miles in one direction and 1,000 miles in another area,\\" Talley said. \\"The front edge of it has gotten here and the whole cloud should arrive at the end of another year.\\" To better pinpoint the debris and update models, NOAA has turned to satellite images and reports from commercial shipping lines, according to Wallace of the marine debris program. \\"It is extremely spread out, and if you were sailing through it you would not see much,\\" said Talley. Earlier this month, the U.S. Coast Guard opened fire on the drifting 200-foot trawler 180 miles southwest of Sitka, Alaska, after it determined the \\"unmanned, unlit, unmarked vessel\\" posed a hazard to mariners and the marine environment. It was a dramatic end for the Japanese squid trawler. It was bound for a scrap yard before becoming part of the debris. The soccer ball that recently washed up on a remote Alaskan beach apparently belonged to a teenager from a Japanese city devastated by the earthquake and tsunami. Misaki Murakami, a 16-year-old high school student, said he has \\"no doubt\\" that the ball is his after hearing that his name was among the characters written on it, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. NOAA blogs about the soccer ball Ocean debris is nothing new, but \\"If you look at it over a long time, it is worse now than it has been,\\" said Wallace. Plastic does not degrade, nor does fishing gear made of synthetic materials. \\"Derelict fishing gear used to be made of ropes and would break down quicker,\\" she said. Even with models and technology, predicting exactly where debris will come ashore is far from an exact science. \\"We can only forecast a few days into the future, because of wind and current,\\" Wallace said. \\"We expect there to be an upswing in debris on the shore. The interesting thing is we don't know where it's going to be, and we think it is going to be spread out.\\" She cautioned against overreaction. \\"We don't want people to cancel their beach vacation (thinking) it will be inundated with beach debris,\\" said Wallace. Still, agencies want to be prepared, and officials understand concerns. \\"This is a really human tragedy that happened in Japan,\\" said Wallace. \\"It captured the media and public's sympathy. Afterward, you saw the videos of what was washed\\" out into the sea. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"In 2011, a big earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, causing lots of damage and washing many things into the ocean. Some of this stuff, called debris, is slowly floating across the Pacific Ocean towards the United States and Canada. It could take a few years for everything to wash up on their shores, but some things like soccer balls, fishing nets, and barrels have already been found. Scientists and other officials are working together to watch the debris and help make sure it doesn't harm our beaches and the animals that live there. They say it's okay for people to visit the beach and that it's not likely that the debris has any bad radiation. The debris is spread out over a very big area in the ocean, so it's hard for them to know exactly where or when it will reach the shores. But they want to be prepared and ask people to help keep the beaches clean."},{"question":"Math Problem Solve -173*t = 162*t + 18*t + 3177 for t.","response":"To solve this equation, we first combine all of the terms containing the variable t on one side and all the constants on the other side. The equation given is: -173*t = 162*t + 18*t + 3177 First, let's combine the terms with t on the right side of the equation: -173*t = (162*t + 18*t) + 3177 -173*t = 180*t + 3177 Now, let's isolate t by moving all the t terms to one side of the equation: -173*t - 180*t = 3177 -353*t = 3177 To solve for t, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -353: t = 3177 / -353 t = -9 So, the solution for the equation -173*t = 162*t + 18*t + 3177 is t = -9."},{"question":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","response":"Sentence: The diligent biologists discovered a rare, phosphorescent plant species in the depths of the mysterious Amazon rainforest while on their groundbreaking research expedition.

The sleek design of the gadget appealed to his visual taste, but it was the intricacies of its operating system and plethora of features that truly captivated him. Having always been an ardent fan of innovative technology, Greg was intrigued by the amount of sophisticated technology compactly fitted into that lightweight, wrist-worn device. The fitness tracker brilliantly combined practicality with tech-appeal and was more than just a stylish accessory or a fad. Equipped with a high-tech sensor suite, it was designed to monitor various physical metrics like step count, heart rate, and even sleep patterns – all things Greg had been neglecting due to his relaxed nature. The allure of instant digital data transformed his mundane daily routines into something of a science experiment. With every step taken, heartbeat recorded, and hour of sleep tracked, the fitness tracker was contributing to a database that Greg could analyze for improvements. The fact that this tiny device could pick up on details that even he failed to register wasn't just impressive; it was also a much-required wake-up call. The fitness tracker also came with an accompanying smartphone app, which allowed Greg to visualize and track his progress over time. This aspect of gamification seamlessly integrated into the device was a luring factor, calling to his love of digital interfaces and graphics. Furthermore, the fitness tracker encompassed a sense of modernity and progress. Greg admired the seamless integration of the fitness tracker with his daily life and other smart devices. Notifications about meeting his daily step targets or needing to get more sleep were just as regular as his email or social media notifications, albeit much healthier. Finally, the fitness tracker presented him an opportunity to quench his thirst for understanding newer technology. By chasing a healthier lifestyle using his love for technology, Greg saw the chance to turn a weakness into a strength. Although he bought a journal as well, it couldn't compete with the allure of the fitness tracker. Not that he didn't appreciate jotting notes or charting out manually, but the journal simply represented an analog activity in his digital world. In conclusion, Greg preferred the fitness tracker over the journal because of his affinity for technology. It was not just a step towards a healthier life but also a journey into understanding modern gadgetry. The fitness tracker effectively combined Greg's preference for contemporary technology with an initiative to overcome his lethargy, making it an obvious choice over the traditional journal."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person in whose place Hugh Robertson was appointed complex manager at Rockefeller Center? from the following article ? The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza. Merle Crowell set up a viewing platform on the east side of Rockefeller Center and founded the facetious \\"Sidewalk Superintendents' Club\\" so the public could view construction.

Choices: - muscle tissues - blood tissue - dependent tissue - nervous tissue A: A:","response":"The correct answer is nervous tissue. Nervous tissue is a specialized and crucial component of the human body and plays a significant role in the overall functioning of the body's systems. It primarily consists of nerve cells, also known as neurons, which are responsible for sensing external and internal stimuli, transmitting the signals via electrical impulses, and enabling communication between various body parts. Nervous tissue can be categorized into two main types, based on their location and function: 1. Central nervous system (CNS) tissue: This type of nervous tissue is found in the brain and spinal cord, which make up the central nervous system. The primary roles of the CNS are processing and integrating the information it receives from peripheral nerves, coordinating and controlling the functions of the entire body, and generating thought processes and behavior. 2. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissue: Peripheral nervous system tissue extends from the central nervous system to different parts of the body, including the organs, limbs, and other structures. The main function of the PNS is to relay the sensory information from the body to the CNS and broadcast signals from the CNS to various muscles, glands, and other tissues. Now, let's compare nervous tissue to the other choices mentioned: - Muscle tissues: These tissues are composed of specialized cells that contract and generate movement. There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Skeletal muscles are associated with voluntary movements, cardiac muscles make up the heart, and smooth muscles are found in various organs and control involuntary processes like the movements of food in the digestive system. Muscle tissue is not involved in sensing stimuli and transmitting signals. - Blood tissue: Technically, blood is classified as a connective tissue and is composed of four primary components: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood is responsible for the transportation of oxygen, nutrients, hormones, waste products, and immune cells throughout the body. While blood does play a role in transporting signal molecules like hormones, it does not contain nerve cells or transmits signals via electrical impulses, the same way nervous tissue does. - Dependent tissue: There is no such thing as \\"dependent tissue\\" in the context of human anatomy and physiology. The term may have been mistakenly mentioned or is irrelevant to the question at hand. In conclusion, nervous tissue is made up of nerve cells, or neurons, that sense stimuli and transmit signals in the form of electrical impulses throughout the body. This unique function sets them apart from other types of tissues, such as muscle and blood tissue."},{"question":"Serbia lacks \\"concrete solutions that would bring it closer to Euro-Atlantic structures\\", political analyst Dejan Vuk Stankovic told SETimes.

The doctor recommended cigars more than he did the cigarettes because the Choose your answer from: I. cigarettes were more deadly. II. cigars were more deadly.","response":"The doctor recommended cigars more than he did the cigarettes because the cigarettes were more deadly. It is important to note that both cigarettes and cigars pose significant health risks and should ideally not be used at all; however, there are some differences between the two that could lead the doctor to choose one over the other. I. Cigarettes were more deadly: 1. Higher levels of toxic chemicals: Cigarettes generally contain higher levels of toxic chemicals, such as tar and nicotine, as compared to cigars. The chemicals in cigarettes are also more easily absorbed into the body since they have a finer cut. This could result in a greater amount of harmful substances being absorbed through the lungs and ultimately causing more damage. 2. The way they are smoked: Cigarette smoking typically involves inhaling the smoke, which means harmful chemicals, such as carbon monoxide and acetaldehyde, directly enter the lungs. On the other hand, cigar smokers tend to \\"puff\\" rather than inhale the smoke. While this practice still exposes smokers to harmful chemicals and carcinogens, they are less likely to experience the same degree of lung damage as cigarette smokers. 3. Frequency of use: Cigarette smokers tend to smoke more frequently and consume more cigarettes daily than those who smoke cigars. This higher frequency of use contributes to a greater overall exposure to harmful substances, potentially increasing the risk of various health issues. 4. Addiction potential: Cigarettes contain high levels of nicotine, making them more addictive than cigars. This heightened addiction potential may lead to more prolonged use, increasing the likelihood of developing smoking-related health issues. Despite the doctor's recommendation of cigars over cigarettes, it is essential to emphasize that smoking, in general, is extremely harmful to one's health. Both cigarettes and cigars have been linked to various health conditions such as lung cancer, heart disease, and numerous respiratory issues. The healthiest option is to avoid smoking altogether."},{"question":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer. H-alpha (Hα) is a specific deep-red visible spectral line in the Balmer series with a wavelength of 656.28 nm in air; it occurs when a hydrogen electron falls from its third to second lowest energy level. H-alpha light is important to astronomers as it is emitted by many emission nebulae and can be used to observe features in the Sun's atmosphere, including solar prominences and the chromosphere. Based on this passage, when is h alpha line in the emission spectrum of hydrogen atom obtained?","response":"First, let's break down the information given in the passage. It mentions that H-alpha (Hα) is a deep-red visible spectral line in the Balmer series. The Balmer series is a set of hydrogen emission lines that occur when an electron transitions from a higher energy level (n>2) to the second energy level (n=2). The passage also states that the wavelength of H-alpha is 656.28 nm in air. Furthermore, it states that H-alpha occurs when a hydrogen electron falls from its third to the second lowest energy level, which corresponds to a transition from the n=3 energy level to n=2. Now, let's answer the question: When is the H-alpha line in the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom obtained? The H-alpha line in the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom is obtained when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from the third energy level (n=3) to the second energy level (n=2)."},{"question":"Article: It was a Sunday morning.

Would he feel more resistance stretching the band to 40 cm or or 30 cm? Assuming that: The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. Answer:","response":"Based on the given assumption that the farther Jim stretches the rubber band, the greater the resistance becomes, Jim would feel more resistance stretching the band to 40 cm as opposed to 30 cm. To explain this further, let's consider the properties of an elastic material such as a rubber band. Rubber bands are made of elastic polymers that allow them to stretch when force is applied and return to their original shape when the force is removed. The resistance experienced while stretching a rubber band is due to the molecular structure of the polymers. When a rubber band is unstressed, its molecules are coiled and tangled. As the rubber band is stretched, the molecules straighten out and align themselves in the direction of the applied force. Elastic materials are governed by Hooke's Law, which states that the force needed to extend or compress a material by a certain distance is proportional to that distance. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: F = k * x where: F is the force required to stretch or compress the material, k is the spring constant, which is a property of the material, and x is the distance the material is being stretched or compressed from its equilibrium position. In the context of Jim stretching the rubber band, the force required to stretch the rubber band is the resistance that he feels when pulling it. Since the stretching distance (x) is larger for 40 cm compared to 30 cm, the force (F) required to stretch the rubber band to 40 cm will also be larger according to Hooke's Law. Therefore, Jim would feel more resistance stretching the rubber band to 40 cm as opposed to 30 cm. It is important to note that the response and resistance of rubber bands are not always linear, as Hooke's Law would suggest, due to their viscoelastic properties. This means that the rubber band's resistance to deformation might not be exactly proportional to the distance it is stretched. However, for the purpose of this answer and based on the given assumption, it is sufficient to say that Jim would experience greater resistance when stretching the rubber band to 40 cm."},{"question":"Pick your answer from: (A). negative (B). positive What would be an example of an (A). review?","response":"A negative review is when someone doesn't like something and says bad things about it.

The South Korean firm announced the feature at the global launch event for the G3 handset, held in London.\` The technology is designed to let the Android-powered device's camera focus in dim light conditions and quickly lock onto moving objects. Experts praised the innovation, but suggested its effect on the firm's global sales ranking would be limited. \\"Handsets are becoming harder to identify just from the way they look,\\" said Jasdeep Badyal from the telecoms consultancy CCS Insight. \\"A device needs to have some standout features so that when a consumer goes into a store the retailer can explain what makes it different from other smartphones. \\"But it will still be a difficult battle for LG, particularly because of the bigger marketing budgets that Samsung, Apple and Sony have.\\" LG nearly doubled its handset sales to consumers from 2.6 million smartphones in 2012 to 4.6 million in 2013, according to tech research firm Gartner. However, over the same period the South Korean's smartphone market share only rose from 3.8% to 4.8%, with it remaining in fourth place behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei. The G3 features a 5.5in (14cm) screen with 538 pixels per inch making it bigger and higher resolution than both its predecessor, the G2, and Samsung's S5. LG compared the \\"quad HD\\" branded screen as offering a similar level of detail to a high quality art book and added that it had taken steps to limit the extra toll this upgrade would take on battery life. However the device's main 13 megapixel rear camera has a lower resolution than Samsung's. But the camera is enhanced by the Laser Auto Focus function, which LG said allowed it to focus in 0.276 of a second - faster, it said, than a human's brain signals take to reach their hand. It works by sending out a low-powered laser beam that allows the device to measure its distance from the photo's subject more accurately than \\"phase detection\\" - the analysis of contrast and the focus-assist lamps used by some other devices. \\"I remember Sony's early attempts at laser-guided autofocus, over a decade ago, said Jon Devo, technical writer at Amateur Photographer magazine. \\"It was also referred to as 'Hologram AF' and worked similarly to how an auto focus-assist beam on modern digital cameras works. \\"One of the advantages of having an assist beam or laser is that it can help focus in extremely low light and even in total darkness, although the method was typically slow. \\"If the LG G3 can do that effectively and at speed, it could be a game-changing feature in mobile phone photography.\\" Other innovations announced by LG included the ability to trigger a photograph by making a hand gesture at the phone, which triggers a short countdown before the shot is taken. The firm suggested that this made the device ideal for \\"selfies\\". However, it will face competition from Huawei for this accolade. The Chinese firm unveiled its P7 handset last month, which features an 8MP front camera - significantly more than the 2.1MP in LG's machine.","response":"LG's new G3 phone has a special camera that uses a laser to focus quickly on moving objects and work well in dim light, making it a good choice for taking fun pictures!"},{"question":"Complete the following sentence.

The average household size was 2.38 and the average family size was 3.04. Answer this question: How many in percent of households had a female householder with a husband present?","response":"First, we must find the total percentage of households with a female householder. We have the information that 17.2% households had a female householder with no husband present. Then we know that 38.2% households were married couples living together. We can make an assumption that approximately half of these households will have a female householder (since the other half will have a male householder). However, this would not give an exact number and the user's question requires a definite percentage. So, to find the accurate percentage of households with a female householder with a husband present, we should subtract the percentage of households with a female householder with no husband present from the total percentage of households with married couples. Let's perform the calculation: 38.2% (households with married couples) - 17.2% (households with a female householder and no husband present) = 21.0% Hence, 21.0% of households had a female householder with a husband present.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: McQ Movie plot: It is just before dawn in Seattle. A man dons dark glasses and gloves and loads a 9mm silenced automatic handgun. He drives into town, where he shoots a policeman (Officer Philip Forsell; in the film the character is identified only as Hyatt) on his beat, then drives to a police impound yard and shoots the officer on duty (dialogue identifies him as Wally Johnson). At a luncheonette, as he washes his hands, he momentarily flashes a police badge belonging to Detective Sgt. Stan Boyle (William Bryant). When a car pulls up, Boyle goes outside and gives the driver a satchel containing the 9mm and proceeds to his own car â but is shot in the back by the unseen driver. Seattle Police Department, and the head of the homicide investigation, Captain Edward Kosterman (Eddie Albert), believe the shootings are the work of street militants; Kosterman orders an immediate dragnet. Elsewhere, Detective Lieutenant Lon \\"McQ\\" McHugh (Wayne) escapes an attempt on his life by a professional hit man named Samuels. McQ had been woken minutes before by a phone call to him on his boat, telling him of the shootings of his longtime partner and the two other police officers. Because he and Boyle had been investigating drug trafficking in the city, McQ is convinced from the start that the target of their investigation, local shipping magnate and known drug dealer Manny Santiago (Al Lettieri), is responsible for the shootings. Despite a warning from Captain Kosterman to leave the investigation to the department, McQ, after talking with Boyle's wife Lois (Diana Muldaur), gets behind the wheel of his personal Pontiac Firebird car and begins tailing Santiago. After seeing a TV news report that Boyle has died of his injuries, he rages after Santiago and beats him viciously in a men's room.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Q-SKY radio station manager/program director Jeff Dugan builds a large fan base by assembling a group of charismatic DJ personalities playing popular rock and roll. (Screenwriter Ezra Sacks worked at Los Angeles' fabled FM station KMET in the early 70s, and Jeff Dugan is based loosely on KMET program director Mike Herrington.) He soon finds that corporate management expects Jeff to use the station's position atop the ratings to sell more advertising time. A:","response":"Based on the context provided, the station that sits atop the ratings is Q-SKY radio station. This station is managed and directed by Jeff Dugan, who has successfully built a large fan base through the strategic employment of charismatic DJ personalities that play popular rock and roll music. This approach has helped Q-SKY achieve the top spot in the ratings, making it highly popular among listeners. Q-SKY's success can be attributed to the experience and knowledge Jeff Dugan has gained from his background in the radio industry, as well as the influence of real-life radio program directors such as Mike Herrington from the renowned KMET radio station in Los Angeles. Herrington's expertise in the field serves as an inspiration for Jeff Dugan in adopting best practices to drive Q-SKY's popularity. Given its leading position in the ratings, Q-SKY radio station is now expected by corporate management to leverage this achievement to sell more advertising time. This implies that the high ratings not only increase the station's listenership but also have significant potential for attracting advertisers who would be willing to pay a premium in order to access the vast audience that Q-SKY reaches. As a result, Q-SKY's top position in the ratings not only signifies its success as an entertainment provider but also indicates the station's ability to generate substantial revenue from advertisers who are eager to capitalize on its popularity.

He failed to appear at the High Court for a contempt of court hearing after refusing to demolish the house. A warrant was issued for his arrest and the case was adjourned until 2 November. Mr Fidler then arrived at the court after the hearing, saying he had missed the case because he thought it was taking place later in the day.

While the origins of table tennis can be traced back to a game called whiff-whaff or gossima, Gibb's refinements and improvements to the game led to the modern form we know today. At that time, table tennis was developed as an indoor adaptation of lawn tennis, a sport that was gaining popularity in British high society. Initially, players used improvised equipment, like cigar box lids for rackets and champagne corks for balls. Practitioners played this early version of the game on dining tables, hitting lightweight balls back and forth using books as a net. James Gibb made significant contributions by standardizing the rules and equipment. In 1901, he patented celluloid balls that had a consistent bounce and were much more suited for play than previous materials. These hollow, celluloid balls provided a reasonable bounce and could be easily produced in large quantities. He also started using wooden paddles covered with rubber, offering improved grip and control compared to the rudimentary equipment used initially. Gibb's improvements caught on quickly, and the game started spreading across Europe and Asia. It is believed that British army officers stationed in India brought the game back to Britain, where it gained enormous popularity as a recreational activity. The distinctive \\"ping-pong\\" sound created by the celluloid ball striking the paddle became the inspiration for the sport's popular name, \\"ping-pong.\\" In 1926, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) was founded, owing much of its existence to Gibb's inventions and refinements. This organization was responsible for standardizing the sport's rules and equipment even further, helping table tennis become a globally recognized and competitive sport. In summary, James Gibb invented the sport of table tennis, also known as ping-pong, in 1890. His innovations in equipment and rules helped the game evolve from an improvised parlor game into a serious sport with international competitions and a dedicated governing body. Today, table tennis is played and enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and has even been a part of the Olympic Games since 1988."},{"question":"Available choices: a). wanted to get close to the band b). was bored with the band c). did not care for the band Q: Lee pushed their way through the crowd and ultimately got to the front of the stage.

More on this and other stories from across the South of England Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said the colony was back up to nearly 6,000 nests. He said: \\"We're thrilled. We saw our first chicks too which means that the eggs are now beyond the picking stage.\\" The eggs from black-headed and Mediterranean gulls - considered a delicacy - are stolen in April and May for their exclusivity and high price tag, and are often used in top restaurants.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis involving less blood sugar in the context of bird nest building could have indirect effects on the process, leading to the possibility of more or larger nests being affected. Birds rely on energy from blood sugar (glucose) to fuel their daily activities, including nest building. If the blood sugar levels of a bird were to decrease, it may affect their energy levels and potentially their ability to efficiently gather materials and construct their nests. As a result, a bird with less blood sugar might take longer to build a nest or might create a smaller, less stable nest, due to the limited energy available to invest in nest construction. This could lead to increased vulnerability of the eggs and offspring to predators or a need for the bird to invest more time in nest maintenance. Indirectly, the increased time and energy required for nest building and maintenance could lead some birds to produce fewer offspring, leading to fewer nests or a reduction in the average size of nests within a population over time. On the other hand, if some birds display a more energy-efficient approach to nest building (e.g., collecting large amounts of materials at once or focusing on the most essential support structures), they may still be able to build more or larger nests despite having less blood sugar available as an energy source. In conclusion, while the perturbation of less blood sugar could potentially have an indirect effect on the process of building more or larger nests, the exact outcome would depend on various factors such as the bird species, their nesting habits, and individual strategies for energy conservation during nest construction."},{"question":"Mu'awiyah introduced postal service, Abd al-Malik extended it throughout his empire, and Walid made full use of it.

We had heard nothing but wonderful things about the place, so we were eager to experience it for ourselves. What we encountered exceeded our expectations on every level – the food, the service, and the ambiance. From the moment we stepped into The Gourmet Bistro, we were greeted with warmth and sincerity. The hostess welcomed us with a smile and quickly led us to our table. Candlelight and soft background music created a cozy and intimate atmosphere, making us feel relaxed and comfortable right away. It didn't take long for us to realize that the menu was indeed as impressive as we'd heard. With an extensive variety of dishes, from succulent seafood options to mouth-watering meats and a delightful vegetarian selection, there was something for everyone in our group. The chef's attention to incorporating fresh, local ingredients contributed to the allure of each dish. We decided to start off with a shared appetizer, the caramelized onion and goat cheese flatbread, which was the perfect balance of rich flavors and textures. For our main courses, I ordered the Grilled Sea Bass with lemon caper sauce, while my friends opted for the Rack of Lamb and the Wild Mushroom Risotto. The presentation of each dish was elegant, and every bite was bursting with deliciousness. All of us agreed that these were among the best dishes we had ever tasted, and we could not stop praising the talent of the chef. Throughout the evening, our waiter demonstrated exceptional professionalism and attentiveness. He was well-acquainted with the menu and offered valuable recommendations. He checked in with us regularly, ensuring that our wine glasses were never empty and that all of our needs were met. His genuine care and attention to detail made us feel pampered and further enhanced our dining experience. To conclude the meal, we decided to indulge in dessert and shared the flourless chocolate cake. Much like the rest of the meal, this culinary masterpiece melted in our mouths and left us in awe of the chef's skill. In summary, our experience at The Gourmet Bistro was nothing short of extraordinary, and it's not difficult to understand why this establishment is a local favorite. From the warm welcome we received upon arrival and the impeccable service, to the exquisitely prepared dishes, every aspect of our evening was an example of excellence. We will undoubtedly recommend The Gourmet Bistro to friends and family and can't wait to return for another memorable dining experience.

These are available online or in pet stores, and they cost as little as 1. These are commonly used to train dogs and cats. It's best to use a clicker specifically designed for training. If you don't have one, though, make a distinct clicking noise with your mouth, or you can use a pen that makes a clicking sound. If your cat is deaf, you can use a pen light to achieve the same results. In order for the training to work, you need to give your cat a reward. A common reward is a special treat of some sort (e.g., tuna or deli turkey), and it should be something that can be given instantly to reward behavior. If the treat is food, it should be cut up into pea-sized chunks. Some cats might respond well to affection or a toy. Use a stick-like object, such as a pen or a spoon. This item should be easily recognizable and used only for training. Your cat will eventually follow this object as a target, so you don't want your cat jumping up to the dinner table to follow her training spoon. You can make a target stick by putting a Ping-Pong ball on the end of a pencil or chopstick. Don't use the treat as the target. This will teach your cat to do tricks only when there is a treat involved. Eventually you'll want to be able to get your cats to do tricks without treats (though you should still reward with treats sporadically). Set aside about 5 minutes for each training session, and hold these sessions a few times a day. Wait until your cat is active and hungry (it should be at least 20-30 minutes until mealtime).

Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","response":"While the phrase \\"double duty\\" isn't necessarily incorrect, it might not be the most appropriate phrase to describe the host's role on Dancing With The Stars. Double duty typically refers to someone performing two tasks or holding two positions simultaneously. If the host of Dancing With The Stars is also taking on other roles within the show or is involved in another show or job at the same time, then the phrase \\"double duty\\" might be appropriate. For example, if the host is also serving as a judge or executive producer, that person could be said to be doing double duty. However, without more context or information about the specific situation, it's difficult to say for certain whether the phrase is suitable. If the question is simply asking whether the host of Dancing With The Stars has an important role on the show, then it might be more accurate to say that the host has a \\"key role\\" rather than doing \\"double duty.\\""},{"question":"Question: Which nation won the 2002 FIFA World Cup?

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","response":"Alright kiddo, let me explain this. The sentence we're looking at might sound a little confusing. But don't worry, I'll help you understand what it means by looking at how well it's put together. The sentence: \\"Everyone keep your mouth shut tighter, the more John eats, OK?\\" seems to have mixed-up ideas. It's like putting different jigsaw puzzle pieces from different puzzles all together. A better way to say it could be: \\"Everyone should be quiet and let John eat, okay?\\" This sentence tells everyone to be quiet and gives them a reason why - so John can eat. So, the \\"linguistic integrity\\" of the original sentence is not very strong because it's a bit mixed up and hard to understand.

Movie title: Escape from New York Movie plot: In a dystopian 1997, World War III is nearing an end, both the United States and the still existent Soviet Union suffered greatly in the conflict and both looking for a peace resolution. Manhattan has been turned into a maximum security prison in 1988 because of a nationwide crime increase of 400% in the United States due to a gas attack by the Soviets at the start of the war in which New York was worst hit. Surrounded by a 50-foot (15 m) containment wall, all inmates are sentenced to life imprisonment, and have formed gangs which control the crumbling, garbage-strewn city.Traveling to a three-way summit between the United States, the Soviet Union and China, Air Force One, the plane of the President of the United States, is hijacked by a sole member of a revolutionary organization opposed to the government; a women impersonating a stewardess (Nancy Stephens), who kills the pilots and takes control of the plane. The militant anarchist crashes the plane into Manhattan but the unnamed President (Donald Pleasence) is safely sealed in an escape pod and survives. The United States Police Force Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) arrives at the Liberty Island command center where he and the chief of security Remy (Tom Atkins) witness the crash. Hauk assembles a platoon of soldiers and they travel to the crash site in a fleet of helicopters. But when they arrive, they find the escape pod empty, indicating that the President has been taken hostage. An emissary of the inmates, named Romero (Frank Doubleday), appears and tells Hauk and the soldiers that they have the President and if they do not leave the island in 30 seconds, the President will be killed. Romero offers them one of the President's severed fingers as evidence. With no other choice, Hauk orders his men to return to the helicopters and they fly back to Liberty Island. In his office, Hauk meets with the arrived Secretary of State (Charles Cypress) who puts him in telephone contact with the Vice President where Hauk asks for authorization of a rescue...

To fully understand the context, let's break down the key points: 1. Cinco de Mayo is a Mexican holiday that commemorates the Mexican Army's victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Puebla, which took place on May 5, 1862. Although the holiday is not widely celebrated in Mexico, it has gained immense popularity in the United States, where it is often mistaken for Mexico's Independence Day. 2. The sentence mentions \\"Africans.\\" Africa is a continent with 54 countries and diverse cultures. It is important to note that Cinco de Mayo is not a pan-African celebration, as it is specific to Mexico's history. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Many Africans celebrate Cinco de Mayo\\" may not make much sense since Cinco de Mayo is not directly connected to Africa or its people. However, it is important to acknowledge that individuals from various nationalities and backgrounds, including some Africans, might celebrate the holiday, particularly if they live in countries where it is popular, such as the United States. Nonetheless, Cinco de Mayo is not a widespread celebration across the African continent due to its Mexican origins."},{"question":"Which entity is this text about? The Drew Carey Show is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from 1995 to 2004, and was set in Cleveland, Ohio, and revolved around the retail office and home life of \\"everyman\\" Drew Carey, a fictionalized version of the actor. The show was created by Carey, who had both stand-up comedy and writing experience, and Bruce Helford, who was once a writer for Roseanne. It was the first television show to have an episode simulcast on the Internet. Produced by Mohawk Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, it debuted on September 13, 1995, and ranked among the Top 30 programs for four seasons before sliding in popularity. Beginning in season 8, the show rotated through 9 different opening sequences, each of which contained a new version of one of the show's three theme songs. Each theme (\\"Moon Over Parma\\", \\"Five O'Clock World\\" and \\"Cleveland Rocks\\") was seen in three different segments, in new, wildly different arrangements. The show eventually went back to having just five main characters, akin to the first season, as Kate, Mr. Wick, and Steve were eventually written out of the show. Kate's character was married off, Mr. Wick disappeared after three appearances until the Season 8 finale, wherein it is revealed he became a weatherman (although he continued to appear in the opening credits, unlike Kate, who was eliminated completely, and never mentioned again.) Steve left at the beginning of the ninth season to \\"find himself\\". With Winfred-Louder closed, the location became the office of online retailer Neverending Store. Drew, Mimi, and Mr. Wick were hired as employees of the new company. Mimi was hired first in a similar role to her old job, and Drew was eventually hired as \\"Internal Expediting Analyst\\", and a recurring gag began wherein Drew had no clue as to what his job entailed. Before being written out, Mr. Wick was at first a janitor, and another recurring joke came in the form of Mr. Wick attempting to climb the ladder back to being the boss. Before being written out, he went from janitor to the carrier of the dessert trolley. Kate left after the first two episodes of season 8, the same two episodes that introduced Kellie, an old high school friend of Drew's who had been working as a stripper. She eventually became a waitress at The Warsaw Tavern, Drew's girlfriend, and the carrier of his child. The plot of the final episode was Drew and Kellie attempting to get married before their child is born. Mr. Wick also returned and stayed on for the series finale. The show began featuring cameos from reality-TV participants in the final two seasons, such as former Road Rules star Timmy Beggy, The Real World alumna Cara Khan, and The Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl. Tony the Bus Driver (Bill Cobbs) became a regular, serving as smart-alecky \\"bartender\\" type to whom Drew could tell his problems. The eighth season was put in a timeslot that frequently clashed with Monday Night Football. It was pulled mid-season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer of 2003. The ninth season did not air until the summer of 2004, with most of the episodes out of order. The last season's tone changed radically from the previous seasons. The directors began experimenting with one-camera set-ups, showing the sets completely built, with four walls in most rooms, and with rooms actually linked together. The writers also began experimenting, including story lines in which Gus burns down Mimi's house, forcing her to move in with Drew after Steve leaves her.","response":"This text is about \\"The Drew Carey Show,\\" an American sitcom that aired on ABC from 1995 to 2004.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the premier engineering schools in the country, is finally putting math to good use: teaching students how to be better poker players. MIT has opened up the course \\"Poker Theory and Analytics\\" for free to the public this summer, including videos of class lectures, the syllabus, and PDFs of course notes. This course is part of MIT’s OpenCourseWare initiative, which seeks to make certain courses at the school available for free, even for non-MIT students. The class is taught by Kevin Desmond, a graduate student in the school’s finance department. As fitting his background, his lectures emphasize careful strategy and data analysis to get the best return on investment in a given game. Desmond wants his beginner students to play “tight aggressive\\": betting and raising often, but rarely just calling others’ bets. The focus of the class is two-fold: mastering the fundamentals while also tracking factors other players aren’t. Students in the class use poker tracking software to do everything from analyzing optimal seating arrangements to tracking opponents’ betting and raising patterns and inferring future behavior based on past hands dealt. Desmond taught the class this past winter session, and was the one to actually push for it to be made available under the OpenCourseWare project this summer. As a lesson in risk analysis, poker is an excellent teacher, and MIT is no stranger to combining math concepts with card games. The unofficial MIT Blackjack Team gained notoriety for counting cards and winning big at casinos in the 90s, and then had a Kevin Spacey movie made about them.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - Carol Patricia Mas (born October 20, 1955), professionally known as Carolyne Mas, is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and producer.

In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions.

By Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia A teenager whose passport has been cancelled on security grounds turned up to a TV discussion about Australians fighting in Syria wearing an Islamic State flag symbol and then dramatically stormed out. Abu Bakr, 19, who is on the radar of security services, walked off set during an SBS Insight episode due to be shown on Tuesday night. The teenager, who was born in Australia but has an Italian and Iraqi background, turned up to the discussion wearing an Islamic State flag logo on his black jacket. Bakr thinks Muslims are obligated help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia. He said 'in order for me to be connected to the values here of Australia, the","response":"values would have to change'. Furthermore, he claimed that there were certain aspects of Australian culture that he could not reconcile with his own beliefs, particularly the liberal attitudes towards alcohol, sexuality, and what he perceives as a lack of adherence to traditional and religious values. Bakr's strong connection to his Islamic faith drives him to prioritize the perceived needs of the global Muslim community over his loyalty to Australia. Bakr's viewpoint has been heavily influenced by the concept of Ummah, which is the belief in a united, global Muslim community that transcends borders and nationalities. This idea has led him to view the suffering of Muslims in war-torn countries like Syria as a collective responsibility, prompting him to support the actions of extremist groups like the Islamic State. Bakr claims that many Muslims in Australia have been radicalized due to feelings of alienation and discrimination, and that this justifies their desire to join foreign conflicts in their quest to establish more authentic and morally pure societies. This controversial perspective has garnered widespread attention and criticism. Some argue that Bakr's embracing of extremist views is a direct result of a growing disconnect between Australia's Muslim community and the nation's mainstream society, exacerbated by inadequate integration policies and rising tensions fueled by ignorance and fear. Others believe that it’s the consequence of religious indoctrination and exposure to extremist ideologies propagated through online platforms and social networks. In the wake of events like these, there are calls for stricter government measures to monitor and safeguard against radicalization. Suggestions range from increasing surveillance of suspected terrorists to creating de-radicalization programs aimed at educating, reforming, and reintegrating individuals who have been influenced by extremist ideologies. Furthermore, there is a growing demand for policies that promote social cohesion and inclusivity, to eliminate feelings of marginalization and reduce the appeal of extremist groups. While it’s clear that Bakr's actions and beliefs are symptomatic of larger, complex issues faced by Muslims living in Western societies, the majority of Muslims in Australia and other countries continue to denounce extremist groups like the Islamic State, maintain peace and advocate for unity. It’s important for governments and communities to work together to address the underlying issues contributing to radicalization, in order to build strong, inclusive societies that respect cultural and religious differences, and reduce the risk of future extremism. In conclusion, Abu Bakr's display during the SBS Insight episode speaks to a broader concern regarding the potential radicalization of Western Muslims and the challenges faced in building inclusive societies that respect everyone's diverse backgrounds. While it’s crucial that authorities implement stringent measures to protect citizens from extremist threats, nurturing open dialogue and understanding among communities of various faiths is equally important to foster social cohesion and prevent the spread of extremist ideologies."},{"question":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Spanning across rivers, these floating bridges are commonly found in areas with a high concentration of water bodies, such as the Pacific Northwest, which covers parts of Canada, Northern California, and Washington State. The bald eagle is a large bird of prey commonly found in North America, especially in areas with significant amounts of forest, water, and open spaces. These habitats are abundant in the Pacific Northwest, making it a haven for bald eagles to thrive. The birds prefer to live near water sources, as they primarily hunt for fish, which makes the rivers in the area an ideal spot for observing these magnificent creatures. One place where you might find a floating bridge that could potentially attract bald eagles is Washington State. Washington is home to several floating bridges, including the SR 520 Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (the world's longest floating bridge) and the I-90 Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. These floating bridges span vast bodies of water, such as Lake Washington and Lake Union, offering ample opportunities for bald eagles to hunt and rest. Another location where you may find a bald eagle on a floating bridge is along the rivers of British Columbia, Canada. Due to the abundance of rivers and lush forests present in this province, it provides the perfect ecosystem for bald eagles to live and breed. While floating bridges are not as common in British Columbia compared to Washington State, they can still be found occasionally, primarily serving as temporary structures during construction or as means to cross bodies of water. Similarly, Northern California is another region where the habitat is conducive for bald eagles. The area boasts dense forests, rivers, and lakes, allowing bald eagles to find suitable nesting sites and ample food sources. Although floating bridges are less common in this region compared to Washington State, it is still possible to come across them near waterways. In conclusion, the Pacific Northwest is indeed the best area to find a bald eagle on a floating bridge. Washington State has the highest concentration of floating bridges, making it the most likely destination to spot one. However, other areas within the Pacific Northwest, such as British Columbia and Northern California, also provide suitable habitats for bald eagles, increasing the chances of encountering one on a floating bridge across a river or lake. To increase your chances of spotting a bald eagle on a floating bridge, it is recommended to visit areas near rivers or large water bodies during the prime nesting and feeding seasons, typically during the spring and summer months."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level.

Both films are shrewdly and even cynically calculated to some extent, aggravated further by Meyers’ habit of backing away from thorny dramatic situations with broad, pandering stabs at crowd-pleasing humor. (It’s Complicated should really be It’s Far Less Complicated Than It Initially Appears To Be, but that wouldn’t solve her title problems.) But say this for Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin: They’re professionals, and their relaxed chemistry and good humor together carries the film surprisingly far, doing a lot to confirm Meyers’ wish-fulfillment fantasies about life beginning after 50. Leaning on the natural, effortless ebullience of her performances in Defending Your Life, Mamma Mia!, and A Prairie Home Companion, Streep is immensely appealing as a divorced bakery owner and chef who’s about to be an empty-nester. Alec Baldwin plays her ex-husband, who left her 10 years earlier for a much younger woman (Lake Bell) and fully realizes that he’s a walking cliché. The exes already share a genial relationship, but between Baldwin’s frustration with his current wife and Streep’s pangs of loneliness, old feelings are quickly rekindled. But when Steve Martin’s divorced, unattached architect competes for her affections, too, the situation gets problematical. Or tricky. Or convoluted. Or some such synonym. Though Meyers soft-pedals the betrayal part of their affair—the scene where Martin discovers the truth is so misconceived, it nearly ruins the film—Streep and Baldwin get the illicit thrill of it just right. There’s something old and something new in their time together, a sense of falling into familiar rhythms while also discovering each other for the first time. Baldwin, importing his devilish grin from 30 Rock, proves very persuasive, and Streep, as a sensualist by trade, can’t help but be persuaded. Her milquetoast relationship with Martin is less convincing, because what she gains in comfort, she loses in spark. It’s Complicated is the sort of “mature” character piece the French do regularly and better (and without the need for quotation marks around “mature”), but the cast at least helps relieve some of the tidiness that belies the title. ||||| I'm trading in stereotypes, of course. But compared to Nancy Meyers, I fear my characterization has the delicacy of Chekhov. \\"It's Complicated\\" gives us Meryl Streep as Jane, a successful 60-ish cafe owner and mother who, some 10 years earlier, was dumped by her husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin), for a willowy swimsuit-model-type named Agness (played by Lake Bell). The divorce was rough, but in recent years, Jane has been doing just fine. Her children are grown. (They're played by Zoe Kazan, Hunter Parrish and Caitlin Fitzgerald, with \\"The Office's\\" John Krasinksi hovering on the sidelines as the way-too-nice future son-in-law.) Her business is thriving. And she's just about to put an addition onto her already Architecture Digest-caliber house, maybe because, in Hollywood terms, that's what real women do to prove they've fully gotten over being dumped for a younger woman. That sound you hear now and then in the post-middle-age romantic comedy \\"It's Complicated\\" — something like the creaky cracking of a large frozen land mass whose surface has begun to melt just the tiniest bit — is the sound of Nancy Meyers having a sudden realization: Men are people, too. At least sometimes, if they happen to catch you in the right mood, maybe if they've just given you a good time in bed. The rest of the time, they're the Enemy, particularly if you're over 40 and still smarting over the cruel revelation that younger women exist. And that some (though not all) older men want them, perhaps more than they want you. Time to put on your mail-order art-to-wear kimono, pour another glass of chardonnay, and get together with your equally bitter girlfriends, all of whom have much to say about how much they hate everything with a penis, although once in a while — logic be damned — it would be kind of nice to touch one again. And then Jake and Jane, while attending their son's graduation festivities, get drunk together, share a few laughs and fall into bed. Jake begins to realize how much he's missed his ex-wife; Jane starts wondering if perhaps she gave up on the marriage too soon. The two begin a clandestine affair that challenges how they think about each other as fellow grown-ups, and how they think about themselves. Or at least, that's the idea \\"It's Complicated\\" gets at in its best moments. (I'll have to get to Steve Martin's character, as the emasculated nice-guy architect Adam, later.) Every few years Meyers graces us with another missive from romantic-comedy hell, and often (though not always) these movies end up being huge hits: In the 2000 film \\"What Women Want,\\" we were invited to howl with laughter at the sight of Mel Gibson suffering the indignity of having to wear pantyhose. In the 2003 effort \\"Something's Gotta Give,\\" wrinkly poonhound Jack Nicholson got thrown for a loop by a very sexy Diane Keaton (who gave a marvelous performance that saved the movie). Meyers' last picture, \\"The Holiday\\" (2006), was based on a potentially pleasing premise — lonely singles Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz swap homes for the holidays and in the process find nice boyfriends — but didn't shoot through the box-office roof as Meyers' previous pictures had. Meyers writes these comedies not so much in the English language as in a broad semaphore that's based largely on the idea of women as lonely, put-upon creatures who suffer because men can never, ever understand them. Long gone are the days of Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks, Ernst Lubitsch or even the early (and wonderful) Woody Allen. Those directors, although they were men, didn't make comedies from a strictly male point of view (whatever that might be). In their movies, the sexes were doomed to misunderstand and misread one another; if they got together, it was by luck and a streak of go-for-broke insanity. Both parties, male and female, risked rejection and heartache. But times have changed, and so have the terms of romantic-comedy filmmaking. Meyers is relatively rare in that she's a woman who specializes in the genre, which supposedly makes her specially keyed in to a woman's point of view. And watching \\"It's Complicated\\" I felt, for the first time, that Meyers was willing to go just a little bit beyond her usual two-dimensional male-bashing — that for once, she was recognizing that marriages, and the families they create (whether that's a family of just husband and wife or one that includes children) are more enduring and valuable things than we care to admit, particularly after a marriage disintegrates. Perhaps I'm just projecting my own longing for thematic subtlety onto Meyers' generally ham-fisted methods, but I don't think so: There are moments in \\"It's Complicated\\" — tied, particularly, to Baldwin's performance and to some of the writing Meyers has done for him — where I think Meyers is grappling with some very real and very complicated feelings, instead of just delivering her usual cheap vision What (She Thinks) the Audience Wants. She does have some skilled actors to work with here. Streep is always wonderful in comedy, and if she's maybe a little too gung-ho about channeling Meyers' pulsing \\"poor little old me\\" vibe, she does at times elevate the material. It doesn't hurt that Streep is simply beautiful to look at. She and Baldwin are like movie-star versions of real people — prettier, most likely, than you and me, but still safely in the realm of the believable, with realistically imperfect skin and bodies that suggest an enjoyment of food or the experience of having borne children. Streep's timing is pinpoint perfect, even when the dialogue she's been given is offensive or stupid. And in places, Meyers has actually given her good dialogue to work with: In one scene, after Jane and Jake have tentatively reconnected, she lounges in the bath — on this particular occasion she's refused to have sex with him, despite his pleading — while he sits with his back against the tub, rambling about nothing much at all. She's sensed he isn't happy, for obvious reasons, and she asks him plainly what's going on at home — not as a way of belittling him, but in the way any of us might reach out to someone we truly cared about. But elsewhere Streep is saddled with the usual Meyers crap: In the movie's opening scene, she looks on with superiority as Lake Bell's character struts around in a midriff-baring outfit. In later scenes, Jane gets together with her girlfriends (played by Mary Kay Place, Rita Wilson and Alexandra Wentworth) to bitch about how unworthy men are to spend time in the company of goddesses like them, though goddesses like these make Macbeth's three witches look like real keepers. Jane's self-pity is written right into her character's DNA, and it has a screechy self-righteousness. Her unhappiness is everyone else's fault. Near the end of the picture, after she and Jake have come to a decision about their possible future, he says, \\"I'm sorry,\\" and she asks how far back that \\"I'm sorry\\" goes. When he lays his soul bare, she can't resist stabbing it with her ever-present hot poker. There is one really nice guy in \\"It's Complicated,\\" one who hasn't cheated or hasn't — yet — made any woman feel bad about herself, and he's played by Steve Martin. The casting is unfortunate: I think Martin's Adam is supposed to be handsome and sweet, but Martin's skin is stretched so tight that he resembles a creepy snowman with two black coals for eyes. Maybe the old Steve Martin is somewhere inside there, but who wants to chip away the plaster to find out? And now I'm about to lay one last horrible piece of news on those of you who may have at one point seen a Nancy Meyers' movie and sworn, \\"Never again.\\" Alec Baldwin is off-the-charts superb. That's probably no surprise to anyone who's been watching him on \\"30 Rock\\" these past few seasons. In places he seems to be sending up the whole movie with his sexy, ever-so-slightly sleazy demeanor, though in the end, he's the movie's most believably human, and most sympathetic, character. At one point, after he and Jane have had sex, he rises from the bed to put his clothes on, standing before her in tight black shorts, his belly hanging unapologetically over the waistband. He pats this Buddha-like girth, drawing attention to it instead of hastening to cover it up, and in that moment he's sexier than Johnny Depp, Robert Downey Jr. and James Franco all rolled into one. I can already hear the chorus: Older men can afford to be more comfortable with their bodies! Society doesn't judge them as it judges women! And there is some truth to that refrain, as there is to most refrains. Streep's Jane is understandably nervous about showing Jake her older, softer body — she explains, shyly, that the last time he saw it, she was still in her 40s. That's not a self-pitying remark, simply an honest one. But Jane doesn't get as naked, literally or figuratively, as Jake does in \\"It's Complicated.\\" In Nancy Meyers' world, the man — especially the cheating husband — will always be the Other, the villain who's worthy only of women's scorn, not their understanding. That said, I'm grateful to Meyers for giving us the sight of Baldwin in his underwear, for acknowledging even in some small way that guys have insecurities too, even if they don't air them as vocally as women do. It's a drag that \\"It's Complicated\\" isn't nearly complicated enough, but at least Meyers has dropped something a bit more subtle than her usual anvil. This one is more like a mere tire iron, but at least we've got Baldwin: He's the pixie dust that chases away the ensuing headache. ||||| It's Complicated Directed and written by Nancy Meyers Starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin Classification: 14A It's Complicated is really very simple. Once again, just as she did in Something's Gotta Give , writer-director Nancy Meyers has given a middle-aged, single woman everything her heart desires: rewarding career, terrific children, fabulous house, supportive friends, financial independence and two successful men competing for her sexual favours. And the problem is? Well, a woman already empowered to the nth degree struggles comically to reach the nirvana of n + 1 – that's the complication. This is wish-fulfilment fantasy, where the laughs lie in sorting out an embarrassment of riches. In short, Meyers makes crowd-pleasers. And if you're a dues-paying member of the crowd, you'll certainly be pleased. If not, don't bother complaining, because all the stuff that seems annoyingly contrived is a calculated part of the populist appeal. To carp about it is like dumping on a Walmart greeter – somebody's just doing his happy-face job. No doubt, Meyers does her job pretty well. She's a clever contriver, adept at adding a patina of apparent relevance, even a veneer of feminism, to situations that are otherwise bogus and artificial. With that in mind, meet Jane Adler (Meryl Streep) and prepare to go through her heart's-desire checklist. Yes, she's got the satisfying job; she's got three kids all grown-up and wonderfully loving; oops, she's only got a near-perfect house, although a planned renovation of the kitchen will soon fix that tiny flaw; she's definitely got a nest of close friends, and don't worry if you don't find the girl-talk hilarious – laughing uproariously, they're their own best audience. Now bring on the adoring guys, with this twist – one of them is her ex-hubby Jake (Alec Baldwin). Ten years ago, the bastard left her for the inevitable trophy bride, but the trophy has dulled since. Now he wants back in the familiar fold of Jane's familiar folds. Tipsy one night, she tumbles, has sex with him, then runs to her shrink for validation, frets about whether her motives are merely vengeful or more loftily self-fulfilling, then tumbles again. Postcoitally, arising from between the sheets, Jane is shyly reluctant to display her naked wares. Alas, Jake has no such compunction, nor does Meyers, about showing his mounds of hairy flab – visually, it's enough to give double standards a bad name. Adoring guy No. 2 is Adam the architect (Steve Martin), the brains behind her new “dream kitchen.” Well, Adam and his brains may lack Jake's brawny charm, but he gets to deliver The Line, the bon -est of mots that, in movies past, would always be spoken by lovely Miss May to lucky Mr. December. But here that clever Meyers puts The Line into a man's mouth, when Adam says to his mature Eve: “Your age is one of my favourite things about you.” With that wish fulfilled, Jane rewards his good heart with a time-honoured trip to his demanding stomach – damned if she doesn't bake him up a feed of chocolate croissants. The love triangle complete, there remains only the teensy task of filling the rest of the rom-com's gaping two hours. No problem. Jake is the brunt of a Flomax joke at his piddling expense; the girls are reconvened for another session of hilarious talk; then Meyers really gets down to contrived business with one of her big set-piece scenes where, attending their son's college graduation party, it's the oldsters who get high on some dynamite weed. Lest the crowd miss its laugh-out-loud cue, Jane points us in the right direction when she exclaims, “Wow! Fun isn't overrated, is it?” Thanks for the reminder. Streep issues it with the same giggly breathlessness that marks her approach to most everything here. This time out, her talents enslaved by the material, La Streep is content to narrow the performance to the role – both are forgettably small. By contrast, Baldwin just bulls his way through the piece, and the strategy proves not only wise but winning. His take on Jake, an unapologetic old rogue as insouciant as his bladder, is the one shard of honesty in the picture. Reduced to playing the straight man, Martin simply disappears behind his squinty eyes, conceding that, when deprived of his usual mannered shtick, he's got nothing left to offer. I lie. Occasionally, his expression almost seems sour, as if his face can't quite disguise what his mind is thinking – perhaps the dark thought that, sometimes, fun is overrated. ||||| Enlarge By Melinda Sue Gordon, Universal Pictures See Jane flirt: Alec Baldwin and Meryl Streep play exes in the Nancy Meyers middle-aged rom-com.

Everything about her movies falls under the category of wish fulfillment, specifically pertaining to middle-aged women. Nancy Meyers , director of 1990's, appears to have taken that title as her mantra. Everything about her movies falls under the category of wish fulfillment, specifically pertaining to middle-aged women. She does occasionally deliver up some clever lines, but It's Complicated is vacuous overall, although attractively packaged. MORE: A sit-down with Streep, Martin and Baldwin Meyers' last films — 2006's The Holiday and 2003's Something's Got to Give — focus on thriving career women living in gorgeous homes, sans romance. This particular brand of rom-com has become Meyers' stock in trade. TRAILER: Watch a clip Meryl Streep stars as Jane, a divorced fiftysomething with a successful Santa Barbara bakery/restaurant. She lives in a stunning Mediterranean-style house, has three loving grown children and a circle of caring friends. Alec Baldwin plays ex-husband Jake, an attorney who zips around in a shiny black Porsche and is married to the much younger Agnes (Lake Bell). We learn that Jake left Jane a decade earlier, but his new union is faltering. Sure, Agnes looks like a supermodel, but she lacks the grace of the charming, wise and nurturing Jane. As anyone who has seen the billboards or ads knows, the former spouses wind up together between the sheets. Jane is conflicted about their trysts and also is drawn to Adam (Steve Martin), a genial, divorced architect. The film makes a few incisive observations about divorce and midlife sexuality, peppered with mildly dark humor. But it stops short of being revelatory and lacks clever banter. With sharp comic talents like Streep, Baldwin and Martin, you would expect something funnier, edgier and smarter. Streep acts flustered, Baldwin's dialogue are variations of \\"hubba hubba\\" and Martin is the quintessential nice guy. There is some silly fun, such as a scene in which Jane and Jake meet at a hotel for a liaison and are spotted by their daughter's fiancé (John Krazinski). But most of the movie is predictable. Meyers uses musical montages and shoots the principals doubling over in laughter in place of crafting witty dialogue. Escapism has its place at the movies, but something this slick is like a lavishly wrapped but empty Christmas present.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","response":"The internal ego does more harm than anything or anyone else, yet how few appeal to the divine for protection against themselves, how many for protection against merely external evils? The internal ego, which can be defined as our own sense of self-importance and the beliefs we hold of ourselves, is known to often contribute to negative aspects of our lives. At times, it can lead to destructive behavior, poor decisions, and an inability to accept wise counsel or feedback from others. This inflated ego and excessive self-confidence can be detrimental to one's personal and professional life. However, very few people recognize the impact of the internal ego on their lives and even fewer are seeking divine help to protect themselves against it. On the other hand, a significant number of individuals turn to a higher power, such as the divine, for protection against external evils. This is because such evils are more easily perceived and visible in daily life. External evils can include enemies, accidents, disputes, and any type of threat or danger that one might face in their life. The appeal for divine protection against external evils is more prevalent, perhaps due to a natural tendency to focus on external threats and overlook internal struggles. Effects of the internal ego can be seen in a variety of circumstances, such as when pride prevents one from admitting they were wrong or taking responsibility for their errors. This refusal to acknowledge personal flaws and mistakes can create rifts in relationships, hinder personal growth, and foster a toxic environment. Furthermore, an unchecked ego can instill a false sense of invincibility, leading to reckless and dangerous behavior, causing harm to oneself and others. In order to protect against the internal ego and its potential harms, one must first recognize its existence and effects on oneself. Through self-reflection, introspection, and willingness to accept external feedback, it is possible to gain a clearer understanding of the role the ego plays in one's life. Additionally, seeking divine guidance, regardless of religious or spiritual affiliation, can provide support in confronting personal struggles with the ego. Through prayer, meditation, or other spiritual practices, reaching out to a higher power can help one gain the humility, acceptance, and self-awareness needed to temper the negative effects of the internal ego. This divine connection can also offer comfort, guidance, and strength to resist external temptations that may further inflame the ego and lead to greater harm in the long run. In conclusion, while many focus on seeking divine protection against external evils, it is essential not to undermine the importance of also appealing for protection against the internal ego. Recognizing and addressing the internal ego through self-reflection and spiritual connection can lead to a healthier balance of self-perception, improved relationships, and personal growth. By acknowledging the harmful potential of unchecked egos and seeking divine assistance to temper it, one can experience a more fulfilling and peaceful life."},{"question":"\\"Denton Darrington\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

For the first question, the promotion of your sweet shop on the screens of Gossip Cinemas will depend on several factors. Here is a detailed breakdown of the process: 1. Research: Begin by contacting Gossip Cinemas to obtain their advertising rates and packages. This information may be available on their website or by reaching out to their advertising department. Consider the following aspects: a. Screen ad duration: Assess the costs associated with varying ad lengths, such as 15, 30 or 60 seconds. b. Frequency: Determine the frequency with which your advertisement will be displayed throughout the day, weekend, or month. c. Location: Where your sweet shop is located will impact the cost of your advertisement. Local or regional ads may be more cost-effective versus national ads. 2. Budget: Establish a budget for your ad campaign factoring in the points mentioned above. 3. Production: Consider the cost of producing your advertisement, including hiring a videographer, storyboard, scriptwriting, and editing. 4. Design: Incorporate high-quality visuals, convey a clear message, and make your brand memorable with an engaging advertisement. 5.

Be honest: Share your feelings about gossiping and how it negatively impacts your time together. It's possible they are unaware of your concerns and may modify their behavior. 2. Set boundaries: Let your friend know that you prefer meaningful conversations and would rather not engage in gossip. 3. Redirect the conversation: When gossip arises, steer the conversation in a more positive direction by discussing other topics or sharing good news. 4. Minimize contact: Limit the time spent together to deter gossiping. Engage in group settings so that the focus is not solely on one-on-one interaction. 5. Decline invitations tactfully: Politely decline offers to get together by explaining that your schedule is busy, but you appreciate the invitation. Remember, it is important to be respectful and polite so as not to damage your friendship. In conclusion, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first one relates to advertising a sweet shop in a cinema, while the second pertains to managing a relationship with a gossiping friend."},{"question":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

This movie, however, had none of this. All that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of Eva Longoria's cleavage (an issue of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I would get into specifics, but quite frankly I've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the movie. The entire time I was in the theater, I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on DVD. Save your money on this one, folks.

Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer. The answer to this question is:","response":"Theodore Honey, an eccentric scientist working on solving an aviation crash problem, decides to give a warning to Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger on the Rutland Reindeer airliner.

If she wants to buy enough cases to last her 240 days, how much will she spend? If the answer is '60'; explain the reasoning:","response":"To find out how much Harper will spend on mineral water for 240 days, we must first calculate how many cases she needs to buy. Harper drinks 1/2 bottle of mineral water per day. In 240 days, she will consume: 1/2 * 240 = 120 bottles Now, let's determine how many cases she needs. Each case contains 24 bottles, so: 120 bottles / 24 bottles per case = 5 cases Now we know that Harper has to buy 5 cases of mineral water. The cost per case is 12.00, so to find out the total cost, we simply multiply: 5 cases * 12.00 per case = 60.00 So, the answer is not '60' but rather '60.00'.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.
