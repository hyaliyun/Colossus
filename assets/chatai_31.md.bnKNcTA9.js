A:","response":"To answer this question, let's go through each option step-by-step and compare them to the situation described in the question, and then justify why \\"corner\\" is the choice that is most aligned with human common sense. 1. Office: Although a floor lamp might be placed in an office, it doesn't necessarily imply an \\"out of the way\\" location. Therefore, this answer might not be the best fit for the given scenario. 2. Desktop: A floor lamp is typically too large to be placed on a desktop, as it is generally designed to stand on the floor. This answer doesn't make sense for the given scenario. 3. Corner: A corner is an ideal spot to place a floor lamp as it utilizes the existing space efficiently and can provide adequate lighting without occupying much of the central area of the room. This location is \\"out of the way,\\" as desired by James, and is aligned with human common sense. 4. Next to the bed: While this could also be a possible location for a floor lamp, it may not necessarily be considered \\"out of the way\\" as it is close to a frequently used piece of furniture, which may obstruct movement around the bed. 5. At hotel: This option does not provide a specific location within a room and the context suggests that James is looking for a spot in his own personal space rather than a hotel.

Aaron only had a few clothes compared to Ian because","response":"Aaron only had a few clothes compared to Ian because he prioritized living a minimalist lifestyle, focusing more on owning items that serve a purpose and bring value to his life rather than having an excessive amount of possessions. Aaron's wardrobe primarily consisted of high-quality, versatile, and durable clothing items that could be easily mixed and matched for various occasions. His appreciation for simplicity and sustainable living led him to invest in clothes that would last him for years, reducing the overall need to constantly update his wardrobe with the latest fashion trends. In contrast, Ian was an avid follower of the ever-changing dynamics of the fashion industry, and as such, he had an extensive wardrobe filled with a variety of clothing styles, colors, and patterns. He enjoyed frequently shopping for new clothes, taking advantage of seasonal sales and promotions at his favorite clothing stores to keep his wardrobe continuously updated and fresh. Ian found joy in expressing his creative side and personal style by constantly adding different pieces to his wardrobe - from designer brands to vintage finds. There were a few other factors contributing to the stark difference in Aaron and Ian's wardrobes. Firstly, Aaron's financial priorities focused more on experiences and long-term investments rather than material items. He chose to allot his budget towards travel, education, and maintaining an emergency fund, leaving a smaller portion of his earnings for clothing. This choice ultimately made Aaron more selective when it came to adding new garments to his closet, ensuring that each item served practical purposes and was made with quality materials. On the other hand, Ian's disposable income was primarily spent on expanding his wardrobe, as he believed that owning a wide variety of clothes enabled him to be prepared for any event or occasion, as well as helping him feel confident and fashionable. Ian's career in the fashion industry further fuelled his passion for clothing and trends, influencing his desire to surround himself with possessions that reflected his profession and interests. Another element contributing to Aaron's limited wardrobe was his commitment to an eco-conscious and sustainable lifestyle. By consciously avoiding fast fashion and choosing to support ethical brands, Aaron significantly minimized his contribution to the negative environmental impacts associated with the clothing industry. He often opted for garments made from sustainable fabrics, recycled materials, and organic cotton, which tend to come with higher price tags, making it necessary for Aaron to be more selective in building his wardrobe. In conclusion, Aaron only had a few clothes compared to Ian because his approach towards fashion and lifestyle revolved around minimalism, mindful spending, and environmental consciousness, whereas Ian's extensive wardrobe was a reflection of his passion for fashion trends, career in the industry, and personal preference for variety in his clothing options. Ultimately, both Aaron and Ian's clothing choices served as an extension of their individual personalities and values, highlighting the diversity in people's approach to fashion."},{"question":"Is the premise \\"People are parasailing on a clear day.\\" true if \\"It is summer\\"?","response":"Well, saying \\"It is summer\\" doesn't directly tell us if \\"People are parasailing on a clear day.\\" However, summer usually means nice weather, and that can be a good time for fun activities like parasailing.

The remaining vampire covens are on the verge of annihilation by the Lycans. Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven. Meanwhile, Alexia has told Marius, who is secretly her lover, that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and his Lycans attack that coven. Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic vampires, who are led by Vidar's daughter Lena. Selene engages Marius in single combat, but he is too powerful in werewolf form, and she is stabbed by Alexia. Marius demands to know Eve's location, but Selene insists she does not know; Alexia confirms this after tasting blood from her sword. Marius sounds the retreat.

The scenario described involves someone eating while sitting on a sofa bed and accidentally spilling sauce on it. Horseradish sauce is known for its tangy, strong flavor, which could cause a significant mess on the sofa bed. The other words provided such as basement, guest room, and bathroom refer to different rooms within a house rather than providing any information about the specific sauce. While it is possible that the sofa bed could be located in several rooms, the most likely location is the living room. This is because living rooms are often the central gathering place for socializing and leisure activities, which often include snacking and eating. Furthermore, it is not customary for people to eat in other spaces like the guest room, basement, or bathroom. These areas are not designed for consuming food or have designated areas for eating. In conclusion, the best answer is that the individuals made a mess eating on the sofa bed in the living room, where they dripped a tangy horseradish sauce all over it.

Choices: - foreign - in space - tent - work - outside The rationale to choose \\"foreign\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"foreign\\". The term \\"foreign\\" refers to something or someone not native to or originating from a particular place. Hence, this term is correctly associated with being in a country that is not your home country. When you are in another country, you are considered a foreigner, because you are outside of your usual residence, native territory or homeland. Examining the other choices, it's clear that \\"foreign\\" is the most appropriate: - \\"In space\\" would imply physically being outside the Earth's atmosphere, which isn't the regular situation for most people. It's restricted to astronauts on space missions. Even theoretically, if you were in space, you would still normally associate yourself with your home country on Earth. - \\"Tent\\" refers to a type of portable shelter often used while camping or in other outdoor activities. It's a specific object rather than a state or condition relating to being in or out of your home country. - \\"Work\\" could be misleading as it might be interpreted either as a job or an activity in a foreign country. However, the circumstance of being at 'work' doesn't necessarily imply being in a foreign country. You can be at work within your home country as well. - \\"Outside\\" is a broad term that could refer to being out of a specific physical space, like a building or car, and doesn't inherently pertain to being out of your home country. It's more of a general term and doesn't specifically address the context asked in the question. Given these interpretations of the possible answers, \\"foreign\\" is the best answer, as it's directly tied to the idea of being in a country different from the one where you live or were born. This term gets to the essence of the concept of being outside one's home country. Thus, when you are not in your home country, you would be in a 'foreign' country. It broadly represents being in an unfamiliar place, emphasizing the cultural, legal, and regional differences that distinguish your home country from the one you currently are in. Therefore, no matter whether you're traveling, studying or working abroad, in such misplacement from your home country, you can correctly be described as \\"foreign\\"."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. Although your behavior is certainly a big part of who you are, it isn't everything and doesn't point to everything you're capable of doing. Think about great artists, athletes, musicians, and business people who started out small and may have been rejected at first. Your sense of self doesn't need to depend entirely on your current or past behavior. Instead of taking criticism as a personal attack on your worth as a person, think of it as localized to the particular action being discussed. If you're being criticized for writing a bad essay, consider the fact that with practice you could write a better essay. Accept the criticism without over-generalizing. Be generous about the other person's intent. They may actually want to offer constructive criticism and help you do a better job in the future. After hearing them out, you can assess whether their intentions are good or if they're simply attacking you. If it's an attack, you can simply disregard what they're saying. Avoid taking \\"good\\" criticism personally. Receiving constructive criticism is actually an important part of learning how to improve your abilities. For example, if you are taking an English class and the teacher points our an error in your writing, thank her for her input, which will help you become a better writer. Research shows that the ability to be vulnerable is tied to being successful and happy. Being willing to listen to criticism is an important form of vulnerability. If the criticism is targeted toward a specific behavior and you do see room for improvement, be thankful for the attention brought to your performance, so that you can correct the mistake. Criticism can actually contain gifts that lead to a better version of yourself, even if the person's intentions aren't kind. Be patient with yourself. Self-improvement can be a powerful force in your life, but self-compassion is an essential component to positive growth. Practice makes perfect, so consider this experience an opportunity to hone your criticism-handling skills. Thank the person for giving you an occasion to practice the behaviors listed in this guide. Only thank the person if it's genuine! Sarcasm may feel satisfying in the moment, but it's a hostile mode of communication that's frequently perceived as negative and can create additional friction between you.","response":"This article emphasizes the importance of handling criticism constructively, viewing it as an opportunity for growth and self-improvement rather than a personal attack, while practicing self-compassion and assessing the intentions behind the critique."},{"question":"Instructions: We would like you to classify each of the following sets of argument pairs (discussing Death Penalty) into either SIMILAR or NOT SIMILAR.

Input: Sent1: As long as we sentence people to a life in prison we are also GUARANTEED to sentence an innocent person. Sent2: It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison. Output:","response":"SIMILAR Explanation: I used the definition of \\"similar\\" as having the same facet, which is a low-level issue recurring in many arguments. In this case, both sentences discuss the possibility of innocent people being sentenced to life in prison. Therefore, they are similar because they focus on the same facet of the death penalty debate."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text.

Translate to English","response":"A large number of mountain ranges extend across national borders. Mountain ranges serve as both geographical landmarks and natural barriers that can divide countries or regions. Because of this, many mountain ranges can be found extending across national borders, connecting regions and influencing the culture, political climate, and economy of multiple nations. There are several well-known examples of mountain ranges that stretch across international boundaries, and each plays a significant role in shaping the world's geography and landscape. Some prominent examples of such transboundary mountain ranges include: 1. The Andes: The Andes mountain range, located in South America, runs from the northern part of the continent to its southern tip, spanning across seven countries – Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The Andes feature one of the longest mountain ranges in the world and encompass various climates and ecosystems. 2. The Alps: Situated in central and southern Europe, the Alps stretch across Switzerland, Austria, France, Italy, Slovenia, Monaco, Liechtenstein, and Germany. As a prominent geographical feature of Europe, the Alps have played a significant role in the cultures, ecosystems, and economies of these countries. 3. The Himalayas: The Himalayas are a vast mountain range that spans across five countries – Nepal, India, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan. These mountains not only contain the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, but they also hold religious and cultural significance for the local populations. 4. The Rocky Mountains: Spanning across the western part of North America, the Rockies extend from British Columbia in Canada through the United States, crossing the territories of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. This majestic mountain range has also influenced the development of ecosystems, transportation, and settlements in the region. 5. The Pyrenees: Forming a natural border between France and Spain, the Pyrenees mountain range stretches approximately 491 kilometers (305 miles) from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean Sea. Its unique geographical position impacts the climate, culture, and ecology of both countries. 6. The Ural Mountains: The Ural Mountains are often considered the geographical boundary between Europe and Asia. They span approximately 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles) through western Russia, stretching from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the border of Kazakhstan. These mountains play an essential role in the region's geography, history, and natural resources. These examples showcase the immense influence that transboundary mountain ranges can have on geographical, cultural, and political aspects of multiple nations.

Identify the subject of the sentence: \\"All the Prophets\\" is the subject, which refers to every single Prophet that ever existed. 2. Identify the predicate of the sentence: \\"never wore shoes when they went outside\\" gives us an action or state related to the Prophets. 3. Analyze the meaning of the predicate: The use of \\"never\\" indicates that not even once did the Prophets wear shoes when going outside. This seems unlikely, as different Prophets lived in different time periods and locations, with varying cultural norms and environmental conditions. 4. Check for any generalizations or assumptions: The sentence generalizes and assumes that every Prophet followed the same practice of never wearing shoes when going outside. 5. Compare the statement to historical and religious evidence: It's difficult to verify whether all Prophets never wore shoes since historical and religious evidence is often limited and imprecise. After analyzing each step above, there isn't sufficient evidence to conclude that \\"All the Prophets never wore shoes when they went outside.\\" The sentence generalizes the actions of all the Prophets across different eras, locations, and cultural contexts.

Now Senate Intelligence Committee investigators plan to ask Twitter representatives on Thursday whether false information spread by Russians accounts made it into real news stories aimed at torpedoing the Democrat’s candidacy, and whether the social media company took any steps to stem the fake news. Story Continued Below Thursday’s closed-door briefing in the Senate’s Hart office building is the latest move by federal investigators to probe social media’s role in last year’s presidential campaign, putting Twitter into the same hot seat occupied for weeks by its larger rival Facebook. Facebook was a natural first target for congressional scrutiny, given its enormous 2 billion user reach and its role as an intermediary between trusted friends and family. But Twitter is also of keen interest to the Intelligence Committee because of the company’s outsize influence in distributing and amplifying news, a source close to the investigation told POLITICO. Among other topics, the Senate staffers are eager to learn more about how disinformation posted on Twitter found its way into the news. They’re also interested in exploring whether automated Twitter accounts known as “bots” were used to boost the Google rankings of fake or misleading news items. Senate investigators are inviting Google, Twitter and Facebook to testify publicly on Nov. 1 about attempts by Russia to use digital platforms to influence the presidential race, a Senate aide said Wednesday.

You can unsubscribe at any time. A former senior U.S. intelligence official said the Russian use of Twitter is “consistent” with what U.S. intelligence agencies found in their election post-mortem, which concluded that hackers associated with Vladimir Putin’s regime had interfered in the presidential campaign. That includes “the methodology of using multiple different lanes in an information operations campaign,\\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation. Twitter’s power to influence the news cycle makes it a convenient tool, people who have studied the social network’s role in the election say. “The fastest way to move a story from outlying media to mainstream media is to promote it on Twitter,” said Clint Watts, a counterterrorism expert and former FBI agent who has studied Russian influence campaigns. “All mainstream media is watching Twitter and it spreads organically from there to other platforms.” Former Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel said tweets from foreign entities intended to cause trouble in U.S. elections should be no less alarming to lawmakers and regulators than the paid advertisements at the center of Facebook's role in the Russia investigation. \\"The sock puppets, the fake accounts cost money,” Ravel told POLITICO. “It's not just a couple of guys in Moldova. If it were just a bunch of kids doing it for no reason, or a bunch of crazies putting stuff up on the internet, OK, that's fine. That's not political ads. But these are political ads: People are being paid to do it.\\" Clinton supporters say they sensed early on that Twitter would be surprisingly toxic terrain. “You’d get dogpiled for days if you expressed support for Clinton,” said one supporter, Brooklyn-based author Sady Doyle, who shared screenshots of critics who lambasted the Democratic hopeful as an “unindicted criminal,” “liar” and “fraud.” Doyle added: “One time I got something that was either a bot or a very bad impersonation of an American Trump supporter because it was a tweet in Cyrillic that when I translated was something like, ‘You are an ugly and bitter woman.'\\" But it’s unclear how much help Twitter will offer the investigators. Facebook showed up for its own Senate briefing earlier this month with a detailed story to tell about how Russian actors had used its site. The company shared seven out of about 3,000 ads linked to a St. Petersburg-based “troll farm” called the Internet Research Agency — a level of preparation the source close to the investigation called a “happy surprise.” That raises the stakes for Twitter, which declined to say what it plans to show Senate staffers. A Twitter spokesperson has simply said the company is cooperating with congressional investigations. But Senate investigators are coming to the debriefing with specific questions, the source said. Chief among them: What, if anything, did Twitter do to address bots once it had identified them as potentially malicious? The prevalence of bots is a known problem on the platform, and researchers at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute found, in a study published on the eve of Election Day, that an estimated 400,000 bots were participating in the conversation around the election during a six-week period in September and October 2016. That represented about 19 percent of all election-related tweets. The congressional investigators are also eager to learn more about how disinformation posted on Twitter bled into news outlets. This spring, researchers from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology documented “a network of mutually-reinforcing hyper-partisan sites” including Breitbart and Infowars that gleaned content from Twitter. Moreover, the Senate aides are interested in exploring whether the bot-driven amplification of tweets was used to boost the Google rankings of fake news. Google does not fully disclose how its algorithm works, but in 2010 a company official in charge of search-result quality revealed in a video posted on YouTube that the “organic rankings treat links the same from Twitter or Facebook” as they do from traditional websites. (Google periodically modifies its ranking methods without revealing the extent of the changes, so it’s unclear whether that practice has changed since then.) U.S. intelligence officials have been closely studying Russia's interest in tapping social media to fulfill its own geopolitical ends. A report on Russian election interference that the director of national intelligence issued Jan. 6 concluded that Russian elements enlisted social media trolls \\"as part of its influence efforts to denigrate Secretary Clinton.\\" Those efforts included pro-Kremlin online activists who prepared to mark Clinton’s expected victory by circulating the hashtag \\"#Democracy RIP.\\" Even without foreign meddling, the internet might have remained a hostile place for Clinton. As a candidate, the former secretary of State has often been criticized for what's judged to be a lack of authenticity, a quality often held in high esteem online. Former President Barack Obama openly joked about Clinton’s lack of online prowess, remarking that “Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signed up for Facebook.” But Clinton herself has concluded that the overwhelmingly negative reception she got on the internet was ginned up at least in part by Russians. She dedicated four pages of her campaign memoir to the topic, writing that both Russian publications and independent trolls circulated stories saying she was \\"a murderer, money launderer, and secretly had Parkinson's disease\\" — themes that often quickly found their way to right-wing outlets. Twitter has long avoided drawing too much attention to the prevalence of bots on its platform. In part, that's because such artificial accounts raise questions about the company's already shaky business model. The platform makes money selling advertising in the form of promoted tweets, and shrinking its already stagnant user base by culling fake accounts would make it potentially less attractive to advertisers. Twitter has defended its hands-off approach by saying it encourages the free exchange of ideas and information, and that journalists, media watchdogs and engaged citizens will push back on fake or manipulated tweets. But the former senior intelligence official and other observers of the 2016 campaign say Twitter’s response doesn’t address the fact that a sophisticated bad actor — such as Russia — can create entirely new and false narratives by manipulating the size and scale of Twitter activity. The cybersecurity firm FireEye reported that many hundreds of fake accounts with links to Russian entities were actively posting anti-Clinton messages, especially as Election Day neared. “And then the day after the election, all of it decreased,” said Frank Cilluffo, a former Bush administration cybersecurity official who testifies frequently before Congress on the issue. Much of the Russian effort to manipulate Twitter and Facebook was aimed at exploiting controversies over such issues as immigration and police shootings of minorities, according to Cilluffo, who directs the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University. “It was more that they were driving wedges into existing cracks in our society, around divisive issues, and trying to provide legitimacy to fringe ideas.” “And that’s very consistent with the old KGB tradecraft, like [the false rumor] that the CIA created AIDS, but leveraging social media to do it,” he added. “And if it fails, it's cheap.” Elana Schor contributed to this report. ||||| The incidents displayed on this map represent the ten most recent incidents of authoritarian interference in transatlantic democracies.

FILE PHOTO - U.S. Senator James Lankford (R-OK) smiles after he was ceremonially sworn-in by Vice President Joseph Biden in the Old Senate Chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington January 6, 2015. REUTERS/Larry Downing The assertion, made by Republican James Lankford, comes as congressional investigators probing Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election are focusing on how Russian agents used social media to spread divisive political content. “We watched, even this weekend, the Russians and their troll farms, their internet folks, start hashtagging out #TakeAKnee and also hashtagging out #BoycottNFL,” Lankford, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing on threats faced by the United States. “They were taking both sides of the argument this weekend ... to try to raise the noise level of America and make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they are trying to push divisiveness in this country,” Lankford said. Lankford did not provide evidence to corroborate his statement. A Lankford aide said U.S. intelligence shared with senators showed that Russian troll operations relied on social media to meddle in U.S. issues going back to last year’s presidential election in an effort to divide Americans. Such activity has also been occurring in Europe for years, the aide said. A website built by researchers working with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan, transatlantic project to counter Russian disinformation, showed tweets promoting both sides of the football debate from 600 accounts that analysts identified as users who spread Russian propaganda on Twitter. A Senate aide said the website was viewed as credible among congressional investigators. Facebook this month revealed that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than 100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. Twitter is expected to privately brief the Senate panel on Thursday, and the House Intelligence Committee said Wednesday technology companies would testify about Russian interference in an open hearing next month. Trump last week said that football players should be fired for kneeling during the national anthem. The players want to draw attention to what they say is social and racial injustice. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia orchestrated a multi-pronged cyber offensive on the 2016 election to discredit Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and help Trump, a Republican, win. Russia denies seeking to influence the U.S. election, and Trump has dismissed claims of collusion as fake news.

It is a special night for noted astronomer Ted Lewis, who is preparing a special anniversary dinner with steaks for his beautiful, adoring wife Lana while observing the annual meteor shower of the Perseids. In another part of town, Tammy, a waitress at small local diner with big plans for the future, looks out her window and is excited to see a shooting star, which she takes as a good sign for her dreams. Suddenly \\"something shoots overhead and crashes\\" in the nearby mountains. Assuming it is a fallen meteorite, Ted wants to investigate in person. He reaches the supposed meteorite, which turns out to be an alien spaceship. Then his body is usurped by Urp, a well-meaning, tall, and metallic alien. Urp has discovered that the other passenger of his ship, the one-eyed monster known as Ghota has escaped. He needs to retrieve it and uses a human body to blend in with the locals.[2] The Ghota consumes people in order to grow, multiply, and conquer. Its unquenchable appetite could mean the end of life on Earth.[2] Urp is the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial. He enlists the aid of Tammy, the only human in town willing to believe and trust in his mission.

According to Otto Joklik, an Austrian scientist involved with the project, the rockets being developed were programmed to use a radioactive waste. Hypothesis: All the rockets being developed at Factory 333 were programmed to use a radioactive waste.","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the hypothesis stating that all the rockets being developed at Factory 333 were programmed to use radioactive waste is true. The paragraph specifically mentions that, according to Otto Joklik, an Austrian scientist involved with the project, the rockets being developed were programmed to use a radioactive waste. However, this statement does not clarify if he was referring to all rockets being developed at the site or just a specific set of rockets. There is limited information provided, and it is crucial to be cautious in drawing conclusions from a single source. The nature of covert campaigns often leads to incomplete or obscured information. In such cases, it is important to verify facts and gather additional evidence or testimonies before arriving at a definitive conclusion. To ascertain the validity of the hypothesis, more information is required, such as: 1. Testimonies from other scientists or technicians involved in the project to corroborate or contradict Joklik's claim. 2. Technical documentation that provides information about the various types of rockets under development at Factory 333 and their respective fuel sources. 3. Independent sources that confirm the use of radioactive waste in the rockets developed at Factory 333, or any official statements by the Israeli Mossad or the Egyptian government that confirm or deny the use of such materials in their rocket programs. 4. Information on the potential intended uses for the rockets being developed in Factory 333 and how the use of radioactive waste in the rocket propulsion system might align with those purposes. In conclusion, while the information provided in the paragraph suggests that some rockets developed at Factory 333 were programmed to use radioactive waste as per the statement by Otto Joklik, it does not provide enough evidence to definitively confirm or reject the hypothesis: \\"All the rockets being developed at Factory 333 were programmed to use a radioactive waste.\\" Further investigation is needed to validate the hypothesis."},{"question":"Background: The Outfield were an English rock band based in London, England. The band achieved success in the mid-1980s and are best remembered for their hit single, \\"Your Love\\". The band's lineup consisted of guitarist John Spinks, vocalist and bassist Tony Lewis, and drummer Alan Jackman. They had an unusual experience for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the US, but never in their homeland. Context: 1987 saw the release of their second album, Bangin'. This album did not achieve the acclaim of Play Deep, but it did spawn a Top 40 single \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" (not to be confused with the 1970s Rainbow and Head East hit of the same name) and the minor radio/MTV hit \\"No Surrender\\", and the album was certified Gold in the US A US summer tour opening for Night Ranger followed. For the group's third album, 1989's Voices of Babylon, a new producer (David Kahne) and sound was evident. The title track was a Top 25 single and \\"My Paradise\\" was a mid-sized album-rock hit, but overall the group's popularity continued to decline. After the Babylon LP, Alan Jackman parted ways with the band and was replaced for a concert tour by Paul Read. Spinks and Lewis continued as a duo, switched labels and began recording Diamond Days for MCA. Playing drums on the disc was session drummer Simon Dawson. The LP, released in 1990, produced a Top 30 US hit, \\"For You\\". Quick to follow was \\"One Hot Country\\", included on the soundtrack for the 1991 action film If Looks Could Kill. The Outfield returned with 1992's Rockeye. Its leadoff single, \\"Closer to Me\\", was a near Top 40 hit, and a second release, \\"Winning It All\\", gained some notice due to extensive play during NBC's NBA Finals coverage, NBA Superstars series featuring Larry Bird, the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics and the film The Mighty Ducks. Simon Dawson, who played on Rockeye, would eventually become the band's official third member. Question: Who is the lead singer of the Outfield?.

Options: - refigerator - screened porch - clay pot - shady places - arboretum reasoning:","response":"The best container to keep your ficus in would be a clay pot. Reasoning: 1. Refrigerator: Storing a ficus in a refrigerator would not be ideal because it is a tropical plant that requires warmth and humidity, which a refrigerator cannot provide. 2. Screened porch: While a screened porch may provide some protection from direct sunlight and pests, it does not serve as the best container for a ficus. The temperature and humidity may not be consistent enough for the plant to thrive. 3. Clay pot: A clay pot is an ideal choice because it provides excellent drainage and allows the roots to breathe. Ficus plants require well-draining soil as they do not like to sit in water, making clay pots suitable for their needs. Additionally, clay pots can help regulate temperature and humidity, which is beneficial for ficus plants. 4. Shady places: This option refers to a location rather than a container, so it is not a suitable answer. However, it is worth noting that ficus plants do prefer indirect sunlight and can do well in shady areas. 5. Arboretum: An arboretum is a large botanical garden, not a container for a single plant. While a ficus might thrive in an arboretum, this option is not the most practical choice for an individual ficus plant."},{"question":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A Councillor is a member of a local government council. - Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature. - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham . - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.

(II) cornea. (III) iris. (IV) pupil. Q: What is the opening in the front of the eye called? A: Answer:","response":"The opening in the front of the eye is called the pupil. The pupil is a central, circular opening within the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. The primary function of the pupil is to regulate the amount of light entering the eye by changing its size. In bright light conditions, the pupil constricts or becomes smaller, allowing less light to enter the eye, while in dim light or dark conditions, the pupil dilates or becomes larger, allowing more light to enter and reach the retina. Aside from the pupil, there are other essential components of the eye involved in collecting and focusing light, including: I. Lens: The lens is a transparent, biconvex structure located behind the iris and the pupil. Its primary function is to focus the light entering the eye onto the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The lens changes its shape through the action of the ciliary muscles, enabling the eye to focus on objects at different distances, a process known as accommodation. II. Cornea: The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer surface of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. It acts as the eye's primary light-bending structure and is responsible for approximately two-thirds of the eye's total focusing power. The cornea works together with the lens to refract light and provide sharp vision. III. Iris: As mentioned earlier, the iris is the colored part of the eye, composed of pigmented tissue and muscles. Its primary function is to control the size of the pupil and, consequently, the amount of light entering the eye. The iris contains two types of muscles: the circular muscles that constrict the pupil and the radial muscles that dilate it. In summary, the opening in the front of the eye is called the pupil, which regulates the amount of light entering the eye by changing its size. The pupil works together with other structures, including the lens, cornea, and iris, to collect and focus light, allowing us to see our surroundings clearly."},{"question":"Question: Facts: - years active: 2001 -- present - caption: tanja mihhailova -lrb- 2014 -rrb- - birth name: tatjana mihhailova - origin: estonia - genre: pop - birth date: 19 june 1983 - name: tanja mihhailova - background: solo_singer - image: tanja -rrb- . jpg , esc2014 meet & greet 06 -lrb- crop - birth place: kaliningrad , russian sfsr , soviet union Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of tanja mihhailova .

The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. But I can use this background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland. What is an answer for this question: Which ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock?","response":"Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the Pacific Ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock compared to the Arctic Ocean. This is primarily due to the fact that the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters, whereas the Arctic Ocean only has a single dormant divergent plate. At the mid-oceanic ridges where the tectonic plates diverge, new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. With seven diverging plates in the Pacific Ocean, there is a larger extent of mid-oceanic ridges where this process takes place. As a result, more cooling of hot molten rock occurs in the Pacific Ocean, leading to a higher rate of new oceanic crust formation. Furthermore, the higher degree of volcanic activity in the Pacific Ocean as a result of the greater number of diverging plates also contributes to increased cooling of hot molten rock. As you mentioned, most volcanic activity on Earth is submarine and forms new seafloor due to the presence of divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of the ocean. The more active diverging plates in the Pacific Ocean lead to an increased number of black smokers and undersea volcanic eruptions, each playing a significant role in cooling and solidifying the hot molten rock to create new oceanic crust. On the other hand, the Arctic Ocean's single dormant divergent plate suggests that there is significantly less tectonic activity and, therefore, less cooling of hot molten rock in this region. The divergent plate boundary of the Arctic Ocean experiences less volcanic activity, leading to a slower rate of new oceanic crust formation. In conclusion, the Pacific Ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock due to the presence of seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters, promoting increased tectonic and volcanic activity. These factors contribute to a higher rate of new oceanic crust formation, outpacing the level of cooling and crust formation in the Arctic Ocean, which has only a single dormant divergent plate."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

(June 28) AP The new CT scanner for carry-on bags being tested at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's Terminal 4. (Photo: Courtesy: American Airlines) WASHINGTON — In a massive escalation of airline security worldwide, hundreds of thousands of travelers flying to the U.S. from overseas will face additional scrutiny for laptops and other electronics larger than cellphones, the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday. The tougher standards apply to 180 domestic and foreign airlines that fly direct to the U.S. from 280 airports from 105 countries. The new rules will affect about 2,000 daily flights carrying 325,000 passengers. Intelligence about terrorists developing ways to hide bombs and infiltrate airport staffing prompted the tougher security measures, according to two senior DHS officials who spoke on background during a conference call for reporters on Wednesday. In the case of recent airline bombings in Egypt and Somalia, investigators suspect airport workers smuggled explosives aboard planes. “Make no mistake: our enemies are constantly working to find new methods for disguising explosives, recruiting insiders and hijacking aircraft,” John Kelly, secretary of Homeland Security, said in a speech Wednesday at the Center for a New American Security, a non-profit that develops security and defense policies. “It is time that we raise the global baseline of aviation security,\\" Kelly said. \\"We cannot play international whack-a-mole with each new threat.” DHS expects 99% of airlines to be able to meet the new requirements and time frames, the officials said. They did not give specifics on either the requirements or the time frame. If airlines don't or can't comply, the U.S. could ban electronics larger than cellphones on entire planes — in both carry-on bags and checked luggage, the officials said. The Federal Aviation Administration could also block flights by pulling an airline’s certificate, the officials said. Nicholas Calio, CEO of the trade group Airlines for America, which represents most of the largest carriers, said airlines shared the commitment for better security, but that travel disruptions are likely from the new requirements. “While we have been assured that carriers will have the substantial flexibility necessary to implement these measures on a global scale, we believe that the development of the security directive should have been subject to a greater degree of collaboration and coordination to avoid the significant operational disruptions and unnecessarily frustrating consequences for the traveling public that appear likely to happen,\\" Calio said. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, said airlines need to warn travelers about what to expect. “As these new rules affect over 2,000 flights a day, it is crucial that Americans, tourists, and immigrants are properly informed on how their travel is affected,\\" Thompson said. The new measures will be seen and unseen at airports, Kelly said, and will focus on enhanced screening for electronics, more thorough passenger vetting and measures to reduce the threat of insider attacks. “Terrorists want to bring down aircraft to instill fear, disrupt our economies and undermine our way of life — and it works, which is why they still see aviation as the crown jewel target in their world,” Kelly said. “The threat is not diminished. However, we are not standing on the sidelines while fanatics hatch new plots.” Protocols will change for passenger areas around gates and on the tarmac around planes. Security methods could vary by airline and airport. Travelers could see more bomb-sniffing dogs or upgraded technology such as CT-scanners at airports, like the test that American Airlines is running at the Phoenix airport with the Transportation Security Administration. The advanced technology can peer into the clutter of carry-on bags to detect possible explosives. The tougher standards aren’t an expansion of the laptop ban enacted in March for carry-on bags of flights of nine airlines from 10 airports in eight countries, officials said. Those airlines will be able to get out from under that ban — passengers will be allowed to bring laptops again — if they meet the new standards. DHS officials are also encouraging more foreign airports to join Customs and Border Protection’s pre-clearance program, which screens in-bound travelers for Customs and Immigration before they board planes. Pre-clearance facilities are located at 15 airports in Canada, Ireland, the Caribbean and Abu Dhabi. Sweden is in the midst of joining. But other countries have balked because of the shared costs for CBP facilities and staffing. Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2tqlIUZ ||||| U.S. officials on Wednesday announced enhanced security and screening measures for all commercial flights to the United States but backed away from a proposal to expand a ban on laptops and other electronic devices — unless airlines and airports refuse to comply with the new rules. Since March, passengers on flights to the United States from certain primarily Muslim-majority countries have been prohibited from bringing electronic devices larger than a cellphone on board with them. But those restrictions could be lifted if the affected airlines and airports adopt the new security protocols, officials said. Department of Homeland Security officials said airlines and airports will be responsible for implementing the changes and communicating new procedures to the traveling public. Officials declined to offer specifics about the changes, citing security concerns, but said they could include enhanced screening of laptops and smartphones and increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas. The hope is that the new requirements will not result in longer wait times at security checkpoints or be prohibitively costly for airlines and airports to implement. In a briefing with reporters, senior DHS officials said the requirements will “raise the baseline” on aviation security worldwide. The directives are focused on preventing terrorists from circumventing aviation security. “It is time that we raise the global baseline of aviation security,” Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said. “We cannot play international whack-a-mole with each new threat.” Despite talk of expanding a ban on laptops and other large electronic devices that was put into place in March, senior DHS officials said Kelly ultimately concluded that the threats could be handled without an expansion of the ban. “The good news is we found a way to raise the bar worldwide, but at the same time not inconvenience the traveling public,” said Kelly, who announced the new measures at a security conference at the Center for a New American Security. [Britain, U.S. ban most electronic devices in cabins on flights from some Muslim countries] DHS officials said they have been in “constant contact with our interagency, industry and foreign partners to address evolving threats” and had a shared goal of putting measures in place that would pose a minimum of disruption to the traveling public. However, airlines and airports that do not comply with the new requirements could face repercussions, including a full ban on all personal electronics on board flights, even in cargo; fines and possible loss of their permission to fly to the United States. Officials, however, said they expect the vast majority of airlines and airports to comply with the rules. Flights within the United States will not be affected, in part because airports here already use many of the enhanced security measures that are being called for. DHS officials indicated they have been in touch with airlines and countries covered by the current ban and that “all of those countries had expressed an eagerness to comply so that those restrictions could be lifted.” “We are standing ready to go in and inspect how they adhere to the new security restrictions,” the official said. “It is up to the carriers how quickly they want to move.” It is not clear when the new measures will be put into place, but DHS officials said travelers might start to see changes as early as this summer. Not all the measures will be visible to the public, they said, though travelers might notice more bomb-sniffing dogs, more thorough screening of their carry-on bags and swabbing of devices for traces of explosives. Wednesday’s announcement comes after months of debate over whether the United States should expand the ban on laptops and other electronic devices that it put into place in March for travelers from 10 airports in mostly Middle Eastern countries. The ban was prompted by growing concerns that terrorists could conceal bombs in laptops and other similar devices. In May, U.S. officials suggested the ban might be expanded to include direct flights to the United States from Europe. Later that month, in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Kelly suggested he might go even further and extend the ban to all international flights in and out of the United States. [E.U., U.S. officials meet to discuss possible expansion of the laptop ban] European officials raised concerns about potential new restrictions and sought more information about the threats that prompted talk of an expansion. European Union officials characterized a meeting last month in Brussels with top U.S. Homeland Security officials as productive but also urged officials to consider other ways to address the potential threat. Industry groups in the United States and abroad said they were concerned about the economic implications of expanding the ban as well as the impact it could have on worker productivity. In May, the head of the International Air Transport Association, which represents more than 270 international carriers, expressed serious concerns about the ban and urged leaders to consider other enhanced screening methods as an alternative. Expanding the ban could cost 1.1 billion a year in lost productivity, travel time and “passenger well-being,” Alexandre de Juniac, director general and chief executive of the group, which represents 265 airlines, wrote in a letter to Kelly and Violeta Bulc, the E.U.’s top transportation official. In all, 280 airports in 105 countries will be required to meet the heightened security standards, DHS officials said. Roughly 325,000 daily passengers on 2,100 flights could be affected. DHS officials said one visible change could be the expansion of Customs and Border Protection’s Preclearance program, which is in place at airports in six countries: Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates. Under the program, CBP officers screen international passengers traveling to the United States before they arrive. Still, the announcement was welcome news for international carriers. “Keeping our passengers and crew safe and secure is our top priority,” said de Juniac. “Today’s actions raise the bar on security. The aggressive implementation timeline will, however, be challenging. Meeting it will require a continued team effort of government and industry stakeholders. In particular, airlines and airports will need to be supported by host states during the phase-in of the new requirements.” ||||| WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday unveiled enhanced security measures for flights to the country designed to prevent expanding an in-cabin ban on laptops, but an airline trade group said the changes might cause more disruptions. FILE PHOTO -- Passengers use their laptops on a flight out of John F. Kennedy (JFK) International Airport in New York, U.S., May 26, 2017. Picture taken May 26, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo The measures, which European and U.S. officials said would begin taking effect within three weeks, could require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives. The measures would affect 325,000 airline passengers on about 2,000 commercial flights arriving daily in the United States, on 180 airlines from 280 airports in 105 countries. The United States in March banned laptops on flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in eight countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey, to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with a similar set of restrictions. The decision not to impose new laptop restrictions eases U.S. and European airlines’ concern that expanding the ban to Europe or other locations could cause major logistical problems and deter travel. “Inaction is not an option,” U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told a news briefing, adding that he believed airlines would comply with the new screening. But he said the measures were not the last step to tighten security. U.S. carriers said they would follow the new security directive, but industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A), criticized Homeland Security for not working more closely with them on the new policies. “The development of the security directive should have been subject to a greater degree of collaboration and coordination to avoid the significant operational disruptions and unnecessarily frustrating consequences for the traveling public that appear likely to happen,” A4A Chief Executive Nicholas E. Calio said in a statement. Kelly had been saying since April he thought an expansion of the laptop ban was “likely.” He said in late May the government could potentially expand the ban worldwide. Homeland Security officials told reporters they expected more than 99 percent of airlines would comply, a move that would effectively end the controversial electronics ban. Airlines that fail to satisfy new security requirements could still face in-cabin electronics restrictions, Kelly said. “We expect all airlines will work with us to keep their aircraft, their crew and their passengers safe,” he said. European and U.S. officials told Reuters that airlines have 21 days to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and have 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers. U.S. authorities want increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas, expanded canine screening and additional places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart. Since laptops are widely used in flight by business class passengers - who pay double or more than the average ticket price - the airline industry had feared expanding the ban could cut into revenue. Airline officials told Reuters they were concerned about adding enhanced security measures to all airports worldwide that have direct flights to the United States rather than focus them on airports where threats are highest. European airline groups said in a document reviewed by Reuters that if the threats are confirmed, the restrictions should be deployed to cover all EU departing flights, not just U.S.-bound flights.

U.S. airline stocks rose on Wednesday, with United Continental Holdings UAL.N closing up 1 percent, Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) up 2 percent and American Airlines Group (AAL.O) up 1.6 percent. Kelly said last week he planned a “step by step” security enhancement plan that included short, medium-term and longer-term improvements that would take at least a year to implement fully. |||||Summary:","response":"US Homeland Security has demanded that airlines across the world step up security procedures for international flights heading to the United States or face the possibility of a total electronics ban.

We are given five options to choose from: sobering, conversation, anxiety, depression, and anger. The step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer \\"depression\\" is as follows: 1. Analyze the given information: We know that Jamie was away from work as a result of low serotonin levels and lethargy caused by bad experiences. This suggests that Jamie was going through a mental health issue that had physiological effects. 2. Begin eliminating options that do not fit the given information: - Sobering: This term implies recovering from the effects of alcohol or drugs, but there's no information in the question that suggests Jamie had substance-related issues. This option can be eliminated. - Conversation: This term refers to talking and exchanging ideas with others. It does not represent a mental health condition or a state that Jamie might be suffering from, so this option can be eliminated too. 3. Evaluate the remaining options and their relation to the given information: - Anxiety: While anxiety can be associated with low serotonin levels and may be experienced due to negative events, it is typically characterized by feelings of worry, fear, and tension, rather than lethargy. Thus, although it is possible that anxiety played a role, it doesn't strongly fit with the information provided. - Depression: Depression is a mental health condition that is often linked to low serotonin levels and can be triggered by negative life events. It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, as well as a loss of interest in activities and lethargy. This option matches the given information closely, making it the most probable answer. - Anger: Although anger can be linked to negative experiences, it is generally an intense emotional state, and does not specifically correlate with lethargy or low serotonin levels.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...","response":"Moore was at the Royal College of Art in London when he took timed-sketch classes and saw a cast of Chac Mool.

However, we can explore possible connections between the two situations and examine various aspects of these statements. First, let's consider the individual components of both sentences: 1. Clown in colorful shirt laughing: A clown is a comic performer, often characterized by colorful costumes, makeup, and a distinctive, expressive character. In this case, the clown is wearing a colorful shirt, which is consistent with their typical attire. Their laughter indicates their behavior or emotional expression, reflecting the happy and entertaining nature typically associated with clowns. 2. Mickey Mouse in colorful shirt laughing: Mickey Mouse is a fictional animated character created by Walt Disney, who is widely known and associated with joy, fun, and laughter. In this situation, Mickey Mouse is depicted wearing a colorful shirt, which may not be as iconic as his usual attire (red shorts with white buttons), but could still be appropriate to certain contexts, such as a themed event or episode. Mickey Mouse laughing also aligns with his light-hearted and wholesome character, as he frequently enjoys laughter and amusement. Although the two statements involve different subjects, they do have some similarities: 1. Both subjects are associated with entertainment, fun, and laughter. Clowns are known for providing amusement and comic relief, while Mickey Mouse is the protagonist of various animated films and television shows, which provide enjoyment to people around the world. 2. Both subjects are depicted wearing colorful shirts, adding to their vibrant and cheerful appearance, enhancing their appeal as sources of entertainment. However, drawing a direct logical conclusion from one statement to the other is not possible based on the given information. The fact that a clown laughs while wearing a colorful shirt does not necessarily imply that Mickey Mouse must also laugh when in the same attire. One subject's behavior does not dictate the other's actions, as they are separate entities with distinct characteristics and contexts. There may be instances where the connection between the two statements could be valid. For example, if the clown and Mickey Mouse were part of the same performance or storyline, it would be more plausible to relate their actions in a given context. However, without any supporting contextual information, concluding that Mickey Mouse in colorful shirt laughing directly follows Clown in colorful shirt laughing does not hold a logical basis."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

Claim: \\"Horses are not used for Fox hunting.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search? Options: - yes - no What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: no?","response":"The step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer \\"no\\" for the claim \\"Horses are not used for Fox hunting\\" is as follows: 1. Analyze the claim: We need to determine if horses are not used for fox hunting. In other words, we need to verify if horses have no involvement in the activity of fox hunting. 2. Understand the context of fox hunting: Fox hunting is a traditional sport that involves the tracking, chasing, and sometimes killing of a fox, typically by trained foxhounds and a group of people on horseback. 3. Consider the role of horses in fox hunting: In traditional fox hunting, horses are used as a means of transportation for the hunters or riders. The riders follow the foxhounds, which are trained to track and chase the fox. Horses enable the riders to keep up with the pace of the dogs and traverse various terrains in pursuit of the fox. 4. Evaluate human common sense without a web search: Based on our understanding of the context of fox hunting and the role of horses, we can conclude that horses are indeed used in the sport. Our knowledge of this information does not require a web search, as it is widely known and considered common sense. 5.

Explanation: The most logical next event after rolling out dough on a counter is to cut out shapes or portions from the dough to be used for the desired recipe. In this case, cutting out round circles out of the dough makes the most sense. (1) is incorrect because rolling out slices of bread is not related to rolling out dough; bread is already baked. (3) is incorrect because the mention of a machine on the floor is unrelated and not a logical progression from rolling out dough on a counter.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued. Do you have any questions?","response":"From the given information, it appears that the United States was engaging in diplomatic efforts and negotiations with Pakistan during the early 2000s, in hopes of securing their assistance in dealing with the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. At the time, Pakistan was seen as having influence over the Taliban, a group that harbored terrorists and posed a significant threat to global security. In attempting to secure Pakistan's assistance, U.S. officials offered incentives such as a visit from President Clinton, a significant symbolic gesture that Pakistan desired to legitimize General Musharraf's government. Despite these efforts, however, it still seemed unlikely that Pakistan would actively cooperate with the U.S. in dealing with the Taliban and Bin Laden. During President Clinton's visit to Pakistan on March 25, 2000, he discussed issues such as tensions between Pakistan and India, nuclear proliferation, and, importantly, Osama Bin Laden. Clinton's efforts to persuade General Musharraf to assist in capturing Bin Laden were met with limited success, but the United States continued to maintain diplomatic relations and attempts to secure cooperation. The main questions arising from this information are: 1. What specific incentives did the United States offer to Pakistan in return for their assistance in dealing with the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden? 2. To what extent was Pakistan willing or able to exert influence over the Taliban, and what factors limited their cooperation with the United States? 3. How did the lack of substantial assistance from Pakistan impact the United States' efforts in counterterrorism and pursuing Osama Bin Laden? 4. What additional diplomatic or strategic avenues did the United States pursue in order to strengthen their position against the Taliban in Afghanistan and the global terrorist threat? 5. In light of these events, how did U.S.-Pakistan relations evolve during the ensuing years, and how have these historical relations shaped contemporary interactions between the two countries?"},{"question":"If \\"The sky appears clear.\\", does this mean that \\"It is raining heavily\\"?","response":"No, sweetie.

However, significant waves of migration began in the early 20th century and continued into the present day. There are several key periods during which Puerto Rican immigration to the United States occurred. 1. Early 20th century (1900-1945): This period saw the first notable wave of Puerto Rican immigration to the United States. The Jones-Shafroth Act, which was passed in 1917, granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans. This made it easier for them to seek better economic opportunities in the United States. Many Puerto Ricans during this period migrated to New York City, where they found work in various industries, including manufacturing and service. The number of Puerto Rican migrants during this period was not significant, even though it marked the beginning of this migration trend. 2. The Great Migration (1945-1960): The end of World War II marked the beginning of a significant population shift known as the Great Migration. The rapid industrialization of the United States, combined with the expansion of the U.S. economy, created a significant demand for low-skilled labor. Puerto Ricans were attracted by the promise of better job opportunities, higher wages, and an improved standard of living. This period witnessed the largest influx of Puerto Rican migrants, with an estimated 1.5 million people moving to the mainland United States. The majority of these immigrants settled in urban areas, particularly in the Northeast, such as New York City, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. 3. The Second Great Migration (1960-1980): During the 1960s and 1970s, the United States experienced a second wave of Puerto Rican immigration. This period saw the continuation of migration patterns established during the previous Great Migration, with a focus on seeking better economic and educational opportunities. This wave of migration was characterized by a large number of families moving together. However, the rate of migration during this period was relatively lower than during the first Great Migration wave. 4. Post-1980s and Beyond: Since the 1980s, Puerto Rican migration to the United States has remained steady, with people migrating to various parts of the U.S. in search of better opportunities. The economic troubles faced by Puerto Rico in recent decades, as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes, have also contributed to the continuous migration of Puerto Ricans to the mainland United States. In conclusion, Puerto Rican immigration to the United States has been marked by several waves of migration over the past century and a half. Most of these migrants were driven by the search for better economic opportunities and improved living standards in the United States. The immigration history of Puerto Ricans is a reflection of the complex relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico, and it has contributed to the shaping of both American and Puerto Rican society."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Two random dudes and one hot girl (Michelle Borth) are running away from a terribly rendered giant Komodo Dragon.

Article: My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, \\"I hope that helps a bit.\\" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site Taj Mahal in Agra, often cited as one of the Wonders of the World, was commissioned to act as her final resting place. Mumtaz Mahal was born Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra to a family of Persian nobility. Context: Upon his accession to the throne in 1628, Shah Jahan designated Mumtaz as his chief empress with the title of 'Malika-i-Jahan' (\\"Queen of the World\\") and 'Malika-uz-Zamani' (\\"Queen of the Age\\"). Mumtaz's tenure as empress was brief (spanning a period of only three years due to her untimely death), nonetheless Shah Jahan bestowed her with luxuries that no other empress was given before her. For example, no other empress' residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra Fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given regular monthly allowance for her gastos (housekeeping or travelling expenses). The highest allowance on record is 10 lakh rupees per year given to Mumtaz Mahal under Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state and she served as his close confidante and trusted adviser. At her intercession, he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest honour of the land -- his imperial seal, the Mehr Uzaz, which validated imperial decrees. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power, in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign. A great influence on him, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. Mumtaz also patronized a number of poets, scholars and other talented persons. A noted Sanskrit poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress' favourite. On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh. It is the only architectural foundation which can be connected to her patronage. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1. Mumtaz Mahal's significant influence on her husband, Emperor Shah Jahan, as a trusted advisor and confidante in both private and state matters. She was also known for her compassionate nature, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute. 2. The exceptional luxuries and honors bestowed upon Mumtaz Mahal by Shah Jahan, such as the lavishly decorated Khas Mahal, the highest recorded monthly allowance for a Mughal empress, and the Mehr Uzaz - the imperial seal that validated imperial decrees. 3. Mumtaz Mahal's support of arts, culture, and education by patronizing poets, scholars, and other talented individuals. She supported Sanskrit poet Vansidhara Mishra and provided pensions and donations for the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. 4. Not aspiring to political power, Mumtaz Mahal's role contrasts with her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, who wielded significant influence in the previous reign. 5. Her interest in commissioning architecture, as evidenced by her involvement in the creation of the riverside garden in Agra, known as Zahara Bagh, which remains the only architectural foundation connected to her patronage."},{"question":"I heard that Robin entered Kai's room and began cleaning it so Kai wouldn't have to. And I was wondering What will happen to Robin? Answer:","response":"In this scenario, Robin, a considerate individual, has decided to help Kai by cleaning his room. This thoughtful act showcases Robin's willingness to support Kai and lighten his burden, potentially indicating that they share a strong bond or friendship. The outcome of Robin's actions can be divided into several possibilities that revolve around the aspects of their relationship, mutual understanding, and the context in which this event occurs. Here's a detailed breakdown of what might happen to Robin: 1. Strengthening the bond: If Kai appreciates the gesture and acknowledges the effort Robin has put into cleaning his room, their bond is likely to grow stronger. Gratitude and appreciation may lead to an even more robust friendship, with both parties supporting and caring for each other in various aspects of their lives. Robin's actions will demonstrate their dependable and compassionate nature, making them a cherished and valuable friend in Kai's eyes. 2. Developing a sense of responsibility: Robin's actions might prompt Kai to become more responsible and considerate. Seeing the effort Robin made to keep his surroundings clean and orderly, Kai may strive to maintain the room's cleanliness, developing self-discipline in the process. This personal growth might further enhance their relationship and foster a productive environment. 3. Setting a precedent for mutual aid: By helping Kai in this manner, Robin is also establishing a precedent. In the future, Kai may feel more inclined to help Robin with various tasks or challenges, leading to a relationship built on mutual understanding and compassion. 4. Misunderstandings and privacy concerns: On the flip side, it's plausible that Kai may feel uncomfortable or violated by Robin's intrusion into his private space without permission. In this case, Robin may need to explain their intentions and apologize for not respecting Kai's boundaries. At the same time, Kai must communicate his feelings and set boundaries for their friendship to avoid any misunderstanding or resentment. 5. Learning from the experience: Regardless of the outcome, Robin can learn valuable lessons from this act of kindness. If Kai appreciates the effort, Robin will understand the power of doing good deeds and being thoughtful. If the situation takes a negative turn, they can learn the importance of communication, respecting boundaries, and seeking consent before taking such actions. In conclusion, Robin's decision to clean Kai's room carries both positive and negative consequences. The outcome depends on factors like personal boundaries, communication, and the nature of their relationship. Hopefully, the incident paves the way for better understanding and stronger bonds rather than misunderstandings and resentment."},{"question":"Title: Watch their videos on youtube.

A perennial loser for years, the team's manager Joe McGrath (Strother Martin) has resorted to extreme cost-cutting techniques and embarrassing promotional antics to keep local interest alive. Dunlop, while not particularly talented as either a player or coach, is a skilled con man, and regularly manipulates the team to his own advantage. During a hopeless season, the Chiefs pick up the Hanson Brothers, bespectacled violent goons with childlike mentalities, complete with toys in their luggage. Horrified at being given players who seem stupid, immature, and unreliable, Dunlop initially chooses not to play them. When it is announced that the local mill will be closing and 10,000 workers will be unemployed, Dunlop grows concerned about the team's future. He makes several attempts to learn the identity of the team's anonymous owner (a running gag throughout the film), but is deftly deflected by McGrath each time. When McGrath accompanies them on an away game, top scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) overhears him attempting to get a job with another team. After Braden relays this information to his teammates, Dunlop confronts McGrath, who confirms that the Chiefs will fold at the end of the season. Determined to save the team at all costs, Dunlop starts provoking fights at games to secure goals and the Chiefs start to win games. In a moment of desperation, he lets the Hansons play and discovers that their aggressive fighting style enthralls the fans. He begins retooling the team as a goon squad in the Hansons' image and attendance quickly increases. Capitalizing on this growing interest, he plants a false story with eccentric sports news writer Dickie Dunn (M.

He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. Although Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of Pythagoras upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \\"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \\"for substantial theses in science and morals\\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \\"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism. Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. This ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato. Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: \\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\\" (Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia). George Karamanolis notes that Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy--including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally. The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his Apology of Socrates that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d-34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b). In the Phaedo, the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \\"Plato was ill\\". (Phaedo 59b) Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the Second Letter, it says, \\"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new\\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form. Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates (Metaphysics 987b1-11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding. Mythos and logos are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of Homer and Hesiod (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of tale or history. Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a nonverifiable account, and logos a rational account. Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use. Plato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul. It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","response":"One interesting aspect from the article is about the use of myths in Plato's philosophy.

The idea was floated before the last election by Labour but was dropped after intense criticism from the Conservatives. But Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham has restated his desire to introduce the scheme that would see estates of the deceased taxed at 15 per cent. Scroll down for video. Labour has revived plans to impose a compulsory ‘death tax’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care. The Tory Party has again derided the idea after it emerged that Labour was holding ‘internal party discussions’ on the issue. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the levy as a ‘secret tax bombshell’ and said ‘pensioners deserve better’. The plans will prompt criticism that Labour is targeting the wealthy, who are likely to be charged on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax rate. The plan would also cost the average Briton £46,000 on a 15 per cent tax, the Conservatives claimed. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said that the death tax was 'the best way' to fund elderly social care - but admitted the plan was controversial. The social care green paper was first unveiled by Mr Burnham in 2009, which included a favoured compulsory insurance scheme. A later incarnation, which suggested pensioners should pay 10 per cent of their estates rather than a flat rate of £20,000, was lambasted by the Conservatives. The Coalition has pledged to tackle England’s care crisis scandal by stating that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £72,000. The rising cost of care can see the elderly facing unlimited expense, leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year. Mr Burnham said the death tax was ‘the best way’ to fund social care – but admitted the plan was controversial. He added: ‘It’s only where you create a system where everyone is in and everyone is then covered, that I think you’ll be able to help people protect their own homes. ‘If you have that system, people would pay, let’s say, ten, 15 whatever it might be per cent, well then they would be able to pay that as an insurance payment to protect the other 85 per cent that they would otherwise stand to lose.’ Mr Hunt said: ‘People who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if Labour were ever to get in.’ Highlights:","response":"- The Labour Party has revived plans to impose a compulsory 'death tax' levy of up to 15% on estates to pay for elderly care. - The proposal was previously dropped after intense criticism from the Conservatives, who claimed it would cost the average Briton £46,000 on a 15% tax. - Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham believes it is the best way to fund elderly social care and protect people's homes. - The plan has been criticized for targeting the wealthy, who may face the levy on top of a 40% inheritance tax rate. - Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the proposed levy as a 'secret tax bombshell' and said that pensioners deserved better than Labour's plan."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: powder of the leaves of Rosemary Rosmarinus officinalis 40 mg","response":"Powder of the leaves of Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis): 40mg."},{"question":"Objective: How to clean dishes in dishwasher.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Ronald \\"Ron\\" McGovney (born November 2, 1962) is a semi-retired American musician, best known as the original bass guitarist in the heavy metal band Metallica from October 1981 to December 1982. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia.

What is the answer?","response":"Tilikum, the captive animal that caused the death of a person for the third time in 2010 at an Orlando, USA-based facility, was an orca, also known as a killer whale. Orcas are the largest species within the dolphin family, with the term \\"killer whale\\" potentially arising due to their carnivorous behavior and prowess as apex predators. Tilikum was indeed one of the most well-known orcas in the world, primarily due to his presence at SeaWorld Orlando, as well as the subsequent controversy and discussions around his behavior and the causes behind the tragic incidents with which he was involved. Tilikum was initially captured near Iceland in 1983 when he was approximately two years old. He was held in captivity and ultimately transferred to various marine parks, participating in different shows and interacting with trainers. In 1991, Tilikum was involved in his first recorded incident that resulted in the death of a trainer at Sealand of the Pacific, a marine park in Canada. Following the park's closure in 1992, Tilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando. His second occurrence took place in 1999 when a man trespassed into Tilikum's tank after hours and was found dead from hypothermia and drowning. The orca's third and final incident transpired in 2010 when Dawn Brancheau, an experienced trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, was killed during a live show. Tilikum's story gained further attention after the release of the documentary \\"Blackfish\\" (2013), which laid bare the detrimental effects of captivity on orcas and raised broader questions regarding the treatment of these complex, highly intelligent, and social creatures in marine parks. The plight of Tilikum has since contributed to a broader shift in public opinion, leading to changes in various aspects of orca captivity. Tilikum passed away on January 6, 2017, of a bacterial infection, at an estimated age of 36 years. Although no longer alive, Tilikum's story remains instrumental in raising ethical questions about the treatment of animals like orcas in captivity and advocating for better living conditions and practices with captive marine life."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? When hedgehogs feel scared or threatened, they curl up in a ball. When your hedgehog uncurls from a ball in your hands or on your lap, it means it’s feeling safe, so you’ll want to reward that behavior by giving it a treat. Over time, your hedgehog will start to associate spending time with you with safety and rewards. Keep the treats nearby when you’re handling your hedgehog so you’re able to quickly reward it. One of the best ways to win your hedgehog's trust and affection is to use treats that it will love and want more of. Since hedgehogs are insectivores (insect eaters) in the wild, freeze-dried crickets and mealworms are a great treat to use while you’re taming your hedgehog. You can find freeze-dried crickets and mealworms online or at your local pet store. If you don’t want to use crickets and mealworms, you can give your hedgehog small pieces of fruits and vegetables like corn, apples, and carrots. Hedgehogs are susceptible to obesity, so you’ll want to make sure you’re not giving your hedgehog too many treats. While you’re taming your hedgehog, stick with 2-3 treats per handling session. If your hedgehog looks like it’s gaining a lot of weight, reduce the number of treats you’re giving it every day. If you can still see your hedgehog's face, ears, or feet when it curls up in a ball, it's a sign that your hedgehog is overweight.

Answer: A:","response":"The given product review exhibits a mixture of both positive and negative tones. The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings about the movie, and their emotions and opinions are not consistent throughout their comment. The mixed tone can be seen in the title itself, \\"Weird Movie with A Epic Ending. LOL!\\" - it starts by calling the movie weird, which may be perceived as negative, but follows up with describing the ending as epic and ends with laughter, indicating some enjoyment. The review starts with an expression of disappointment and disbelief over the death of Sigourney Weaver's character, conveying a strong emotional reaction that could be perceived as negative – after all, the reviewer appears quite upset about this plot development. But immediately after, the reviewer makes a statement that the movie is \\"worst,\\" a negative assertion, before contradicting themselves by saying that the movie was also entertaining, a positive sentiment. Following this, the review adopts a slightly more negative tone. The reviewer states how the beginning of the movie was good, but then, everything went downhill in the end. This language suggests that they felt that the movie did not live up to its initial promise, leading to disappointment. They also describe their brain as \\"literally almost exploding,\\" which implies that they were frustrated or overwhelmed by the events in the movie. Overall, the product review simultaneously displays elements of both positive and negative tones. The ambivalence demonstrated in the review implies that, while the viewer found certain aspects of the movie entertaining and epic, they also could not overlook their dissatisfaction resulting from plot development and the ending."},{"question":"Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy in 1916 and continued there until his death? is inside the article: Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [kɑːl ˈnelsn̩]; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the..., can you guess it ?

For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so.

He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \\"[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson .... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is?","response":"The answer to the question \\"What is wrong with the dog?\\" in the context of the novel \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is that the dog is rabid, meaning it is infected with rabies and poses a dangerous threat to the community. In the novel, Atticus Finch, a morally upright lawyer who fights against racial injustice, is tasked with shooting the rabid dog despite it not being his job to do so. This incident symbolically represents the theme of racial injustice within the town of Maycomb. The rabid dog is a metaphor for the deep-rooted racism and prejudice within the town, which denies the humanity of individuals like Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of rape. Atticus takes a stand against this racism by defending Tom, often facing hostility and isolation from the town's white citizens. The imagery from the mad dog incident is used to describe various scenes in the courtroom where Atticus bravely challenges the racist beliefs of the town. In summary, the dog in this context is suffering from rabies, and its presence in the novel is a symbolic representation of the pervasive prejudice and racism in Maycomb. Atticus confronts this \\"mad dog\\" of racism by defending Tom Robinson and standing up for justice, even when facing opposition and isolation."},{"question":"What key details about sobekemsaf ii can be extracted from the following bio?

Johnny pulls the man off of Barbra and struggles with him, but is knocked unconscious and possibly dead after tripping and hitting his head violently on the edge of a gravestone. The man then pursues Barbra back to the car, but Barbra cannot start it because the keys are in Johnny's pocket.

Two years ago, the DUP MP Jim Shannon used parliamentary privilege to accuse Gerry McMonagle, who later became the Sinn FÃ©in mayor of Letterkenny, of the murder. Shelley Gilfillan said her uncle's murder had been reviewed. He was shot as he sat in his car in Strabane, County Tyrone, in June 1982. She told the BBC's Spotlight programme that she did not know if Mr McMonagle had received one of the letters. \\"In the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) report, it states where Sinn Fein gave the government a list and Gerry Mac (McMonagle) was on the list,\\" she said. Mr Cummings' murder was reviewed in 2003. A political crisis erupted last week over secret letters sent by the government to 187 Irish republicans. The letters assured those who received them that they were not being sought by police. The political storm erupted after the trial of Donegal man John Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey last week. Mr Downey denied killing four soldiers in the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombing. The case collapsed because he was mistakenly told in a letter in 2007 that he was no longer a wanted man, despite the fact that police in Northern Ireland knew he was still being sought by Scotland Yard. Although police soon realised they had made a mistake, the assurance was never withdrawn. Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons on Wednesday that Mr Downey should never have been sent the letter and that it had been a \\"dreadful mistake\\". Ms Gilfillan described her shock when news of the letters became known. \\"It was like an atomic bomb had went off. It was awful. I still can't take it in,\\" she said. \\"I still think perhaps this is a dream we're dreaming, this is something you read in a book or you see in a film, this is unbelievable that a government could actually do this to us. \\"Such a dirty, dirty deal did Blair do.\\" On Monday, Northern Ireland's first minister suggested that police and the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) may not have had the legal power to continue the On the Runs scheme after 2010. That was the year when justice was devolved to Northern Ireland. On the Runs are people suspected of paramilitary crimes connected to the Northern Ireland Troubles. Mr Robinson, the leader of the Democratic Unionists, criticised the former Labour government and said former prime minister Tony Blair had engaged in \\"deliberate deception by omission\\" by failing to tell most politicians in Northern Ireland about the deal struck with Sinn FÃ©in. He had also threatened to resign unless a judicial inquiry into the On The Runs was held. He withdrew his threat after Prime Minister David Cameron agreed there should be a judge-led inquiry into the matter. Mr Robinson said the issue of whether the scheme was legal after 2010 may be one for the judge in the forthcoming inquiry as well as the attorney general. The first minister said he intended to meet the PSNI and the Northern Ireland Secretary. He said it was not up to the justice minister whether his department or the NIO administered the scheme; it was a matter of law.

A rescue ship from Clearwater has joined search efforts. Royal Caribbean officials did not release the man's name but said he is from Brazil. The ship was on a week-long cruise. It is now headed back to Fort Lauderdale. In 2009, the Oasis of the Seas was named the largest cruise ship in the world, capable of carrying 6,000 passengers. ||||| Under a dark sky, horrified cruise passengers wailed as a man plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean on Friday after deliberately going over the ship's edge and then overboard while en route to Fort Lauderdale. The U.S. Coast Guard searched Friday for the passenger of the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Oasis of the Seas. The man fell overboard about 1 a.m. while the vessel was traveling 17 miles east of the Turks and Caicos Islands, the cruise line said. The 35-year-old man, who had been on the seventh deck of the vessel, apparently jumped into a lifeboat one deck below, the Coast Guard said. He is identified as a Brazilian national. \\"He was spotted by Oasis of the Seas crew members intentionally going over the side of the ship,\\" Royal Caribbean Cruises spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said in an email. A video posted on YouTube showed passengers calling to the man, who held on to a lifeboat as the sea churned below. \\"Let go of me!\\" he shouted. \\"You don't touch me!\\" A crowd of bystanders watched as he continued talking to someone on board, \\"Because of you, this happened. ... I'm not going anywhere. ... Let go of me! Get off of me!\\" The man, wearing a red swimsuit or shorts, appeared to try and pull himself up onto the edge of the lifeboat. But he seemed to lose his grip or slipped on the boat surface before plummeting into the ocean. A woman passenger shouted, \\"He's there, he's there! Get the life thing, throw it over!\\" The video was later removed from YouTube. On Periscope, another social media app that offers live broadcasts, a passenger recorded the ship's captain sharing details of the tragic incident during an interactive cruise event. Upon learning of the man going overboard, the Oasis of the Seas turned around and 20-foot rescue boats were lowered to search for the man, the captain said. The Coast Guard was called and other nearby ships were also alerted, he said. The Royal Caribbean Freedom of the Seas was built in 2006. It was once the Guinness World Record holder for largest cruise ship in the world. The captain went on to describe challenging conditions while the search was underway — swells of 6 to 7 feet, rainy weather and poor visibility. \\"It is very tragic, especially for the next-of-kin person on board still,\\" the captain said. \\"Also [for] a crew that was dealing directly with the person that was holding him, trying desperately to save him and he just slipped out of their hands.\\" The affected crew members will have access to counselors after the ship arrives at Port Everglades on Saturday, he said. The cruise ship departed the port Oct. 31. Cruise passengers used social media to transmit updates on the search and images from the vessel. A tweet shortly after 6 a.m. indicated that it was light and that at least two rescue boats could be seen searching the water for the passenger. A tweet from about 3 a.m. read, \\"Horrible rain hampering rescue efforts.\\" Shortly after 6 a.m., a Coast Guard plane arrived and the ship was allowed to continue toward Fort Lauderdale, the captain said. The Coast Guard continued searching with aircraft deployed from the Clearwater air station, Petty Officer David Schuhlein said. \\"We have one aircraft with seven crew members on it that took off this morning at 4 a.m., and they're flying all the low search patterns in the area,\\" he said. \\"So we have one C-130 and one helicopter in the air.\\" As the search continued, the cruise line said it was comforting the missing passenger's relatives. \\"Our care team is providing support to the guest's family and our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time,\\" Martinez said. According to Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney, the man's partner was aboard the ship during the incident. Searchers are focusing in the area where the ship's crew estimated the man went overboard, Schuhlein said. The Turks and Caicos are in the Atlantic Ocean, north of the Dominican Republic. \\"[We're] using our algorithms and drift techniques to see exactly where he could be at now, given the drift pattern hours later, to search in that area for him,\\" he said. Detectives from the Broward Sheriff's Office will handle the missing-person investigation and will meet the ship upon its arrival at the port.

Fellow passengers watched in horror Friday as the man clung to the lifeboat for more than a minute. It wasn't clear why the man jumped toward the lifeboat.

A taller wave on the ocean has more or less strength than a smaller wave? Answer:","response":"A taller wave on the ocean has more strength than a smaller wave. This is because the energy of a wave is directly related to its height (amplitude). As the wave height increases, so does the amount of energy it carries. This energy is what determines the strength of the wave. In general, the energy of a wave can be calculated using the following formula: E = ½ρgh²A where: - E is the wave energy - ρ (rho) is the water density - g is the gravitational acceleration - h is the wave height (amplitude) - A is the area of the wave front As you can see from this formula, wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height. This means that if a wave is twice as tall as another wave, it will have four times the energy (2² = 4). As a result, taller waves on the ocean are stronger than smaller waves, due to the increased energy they carry."},{"question":"Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats is an American instrumental funk rock band from Los Angeles, California.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Does a cowboy wearing a brown shirt that says \\"US Army\\" holding a horse's lead imply that he is getting ready to ride the brown horse? Answer: It's possible but not definitive that the cowboy is preparing to ride the brown horse. There could be various reasons for this situation, and the presence of the US Army shirt along with holding the horse's lead doesn't exclusively imply the cowboy's intention to ride the horse. The cowboy's clothing could reflect his personal fashion choices, his occupation, or perhaps his affiliation with the US Army. Wearing a brown shirt with a US Army logo may suggest that he is a military personnel or a veteran but does not directly indicate his plans to ride the brown horse. As for holding the horse's lead, this also doesn't confirm the cowboy's intent to ride. He might be: 1. Leading the horse to or from a stable or pasture 2. Preparing to groom or train the horse 3. Planning to saddle the horse for someone else to ride 4. Merely standing by to keep the horse calm and secure while other tasks are being carried out. In conclusion, while it's possible that the cowboy may be getting ready to ride the brown horse, it is important to consider alternative scenarios and understand that the presence of a US Army shirt and holding the horse's lead are not definitive indicators of his intent to ride the horse."},{"question":"The State Public Prosecutor set up a commission of inquiry.

The case was falsely recorded as a suicide and his family received no compensation, becoming destitute.

The Ms. Senior Florida contestant glided through the Vero Beach High School Performing Arts Center with the humility of someone who underestimates her beauty. Little did she know, she was about to be crowned Ms. Senior Florida 2014. Talley's platform is one of self-acceptance and self-improvement: \\"It's a message to the woman in the audience who thinks 'I'm always going to be heavy' or 'I can't dance'... yes you can,\\" she said during dress rehearsal. While we're accustomed to beauty pageants featuring women in their 20s strutting in bikinis, the Ms. Senior America pageant seeks women with \\"dignity, maturity and inner beauty,\\" who are older than 60. There's no upper age limit and no bikinis are required. The oldest contestant in Florida this year was 86. Pageant organizers Hedi Headley and Helen McKnight worked for months gathering contestants from around the state of Florida. The 15 women who were selected rehearsed almost every week between January and March. The ladies were judged on their interview, philosophy of life, talent and gown presentation during the March 29 competition. The Ms. Senior America Pageant has been around for 35 years, but the state level competitions vary in their founding year. Headly and McKnight originally founded the Ms. Senior Arizona Pageant in 1990, when they weren't even 50 yet themselves. \\"We saw a need to encourage the older adult and especially women that feel they become invisible as they age,\\" said Headly. Semi-retired in Florida, Headly and McKnight took over running the Ms. Senior Florida Pageant last year. The contestants evolved before Headly's eyes. \\"Most of the ladies have never even talked into a microphone before rehearsals,\\" she said. The granny of yesteryear, sitting in a rocking chair knitting, is a thing of the past if the pageant is any indication. Today, women over 60 are rocking it on stage: singing, dancing, sharing their inventions and even belly dancing at senior beauty pageants around the country. The Ms. Senior pageants give contestants a chance to do something many of them never dreamed of doing in their 20s, 30s or even 50s -- take the spotlight and share their wisdom and talent with hundreds of people. In addition to the crown, Talley won \\"Best Talent\\" for singing and playing \\"Sentimental Journey\\" on the piano. Talley faced a long journey to get where she is today. Overweight most of her life, 10 years ago, she lost 100 pounds and kept it off. \\"I decided to enter the competition after a lot of thought and prayer, when I realized that it was an opportunity to reach my dream to touch women across the country, to inspire them to take better care of themselves, and to set goals, dream dreams, and do what it takes to reach those goals,\\" said Talley. She wants to encourage other women to become physically fit even as seniors, which is a message she will take to the Ms. Senior America Pageant this October at the Resorts Hotel Casino in Atlantic City. \\"It has been my dream to reach women across the country to encourage them that we 'ain't dead yet'!\\" said Talley. The second runner-up was Ann Palle, a 60-year-old baton twirler who leads a 105-person senior citizen baton twirling team that performs in about 55 shows a year. The oldest twirler is 95. \\"It's nice to get together with these ladies because we all bring something very different, but this pageant brings us together,\\" Palle said. Each of these women has a distinct philosophy, and if laughter is the key to longevity, Lauren Luccini \\"Miss Congeniality,\\" will live forever. \\"When I used to date, men used to open the car door for you,\\" she told the audience in her standup comedy routine during the talent competition. \\"Now, I'm glad if they even stop the car.\\" Then there was, Julie Dohan, who at 81 went from modeling to art dealing to inventing, but believes \\"the best is yet to come.\\" Raven-haired contestant Lucille DiBartolo is a 79-year-old Mediterranean beauty who still gets carded for proof of her senior citizenship. (Full disclosure: This lovely lady is my grandmother, and I attended the pageant to support her.) Encouraging young women to be more confident, she added that, \\"it's not who you are but who you perceive yourself to be.\\" Last year's winner, Betsy Horn, stopped by to encourage the women. An ovarian cancer survivor, Horn wrote a book, \\"A Little Touch of Cancer and How it Made Me Well,\\" and encourages women to share their inspirational stories, which can come from hardship. \\"You can't get through life without having some event that happens that challenges one deeply and emotionally,\\" she said. \\"As you get to know the ladies, you realize that everyone does have a story and that they were survivors.\\" Horn had high praise for 2014's Ms. Senior Florida contestants: \\"I came away this year thinking these women all have a lot to offer, so they should all get out there and do something!\\" Write highlights for this article.","response":"Julianne Talley, a 61-year-old lady, won Ms. Senior Florida 2014.

In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at 125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at 35 million in 1996 and 20 million in 1997. In the year after his death, more than 8.2 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US, and 35 million albums worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US.Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were 4.2 billion.

Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

The woman left her mat at home but brought her water bottle to yoga class because the Pick from: [1]. mat was needed.; [2]. water bottle was needed.;","response":"The woman left her mat at home but brought her water bottle to yoga class because the water bottle was needed. The importance of hydration during any physical activity, including yoga, cannot be emphasized enough. As a practice that promotes mindfulness, yoga can sometimes lull participants into forgetting the basic requirements of the body, such as staying well-hydrated. Water serves as an essential component in maintaining the body's vital functions, particularly during exercise. Yoga, despite its seemingly gentle nature, can significantly tax the body, and the key to overall well-being begins with proper hydration. When participating in a yoga class, several factors necessitate the need for a water bottle, which is why the woman in the sentence chose to bring hers along. To begin with, staying hydrated is crucial for the body's temperature regulation during a workout. As the body heats up during yoga, a process called thermoregulation kicks in to dissipate the escalating heat. This is primarily done through sweating, which requires adequate water content in the body. A water bottle facilitates easy access to water and enables practitioners to replenish the lost fluid frequently. In addition, water is also essential for maintaining fluid balance within the body. This balance is vital for cushioning the joints and reducing the chances of injury. The practice of yoga engages several joints, including the knees, ankles, hips, and wrists, which can become susceptible to injuries when the body is dehydrated. A water bottle ensures that the woman can stay hydrated throughout the session, minimizing the risk of injury and allowing her to practice the asanas safely. Also, muscle function is enhanced when the body is properly hydrated. Water enhances muscle contractibility and helps the muscles work efficiently. A dehydrated body is more prone to muscle cramps, spasms, and a reduced range of motion. During yoga, maintaining proper hydration through sipping water from the water bottle can lead to more graceful and fluid movements, ultimately contributing to an enhanced practice. Furthermore, hydration positively impacts mental clarity and focus. As yoga is a practice that emphasizes mindfulness and concentration, the presence of a water bottle can prove essential to maintaining mental sharpness. With a clear mind, the woman is better able to connect with her body, breath, and thoughts throughout the session. In summary, the woman chose to bring her water bottle instead of her mat because the water bottle was needed to maintain proper hydration during her yoga practice. This decision was founded on the realization that water plays a crucial role in bodily functions, specifically temperature regulation, fluid balance, muscle function, and mental clarity, all of which contribute to a safe and well-rounded practice. While the mat is an important accessory, yoga can be practiced on various surfaces, whereas staying hydrated is a necessity that cannot be replaced."},{"question":"Next question: when did memorial day become a monday holiday?","response":"In order to complete this task, I need to find out when Memorial Day became observed on Monday instead of its original date.

In this particular question, you're being asked to determine which piece of information is least necessary for a student to record in an investigation to calculate the speeds of different balls as they roll down a ramp. The options range from (A) the size of each ball, (B) the thickness of the ramp, (C) the length of the ramp, to (D) the time it takes the ball to travel. To answer this, recall that the speed of an object is generally obtained by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken. Therefore, the length of the ramp and the time it takes the ball to travel are both crucial records for calculating the speed. The size of the ball could potentially affect how the ball travels on the ramp, especially if the ramp has a rough surface. On the other hand, the thickness of the ramp (option B) does not have any identifiable role in calculation of the speed of the balls rolling down.

(CNN) -- A dislocated shoulder suffered in the warm-up wasn't enough to stop Marc Marquez from competing at the British MotoGP but the surging rookie saw his winning streak snapped by Jorge Lorenzo in a thrilling finish. Marquez overtook Lorenzo during the final lap at Silverstone only for the reigning world champion to slip inside his fellow Spaniard after he uncharacteristically went wide on a turn. Marquez, who began on pole, thus failed in his bid to claim a fifth consecutive victory. \\"As usual Marc pushed in the last laps and overtook me but I didn't want to lose this race,\\" Lorenzo told the BBC. \\"When he overtook me three corners from the end, I thought it was over. \\"Anyway the battle was so nice with Jorge,\\"","response":"Marquez said, expressing some satisfaction despite the race's outcome. \\"We fought hard on the track, and it was a great experience. He managed to utilize his experience and the power of his bike at the crucial moment which turned the game in his favor. It's something for me to learn from and add to my ever-increasing knowledge of how to handle such fierce and direct competition.\\" The close encounter between the two Spaniards lit up the usually dull British skies, revealing the intense rivalry that appears to be brewing between the two. Marquez, the first rookie rider in 35 years to win consecutive premier class races, seemed to have another victory within reach. But he went wide on the penultimate corner while attempting to sustain a lead, thereby providing Lorenzo with an unexpected opportunity to strike back. Lorenzo, a double MotoGP world champion and one of the most astute readers of race craft, seized this opportunity ruthlessly. He stealthily slipped on the inside of Marquez, thus regaining the lost position and eventually securing a victory. This exciting climax at Silverstone demonstrated Lorenzo's immense skill and experience, which played a decisive role in outclassing the high-flying rookie Marquez. Indeed, this was a battle where Lorenzo was fuelled not only by the desire to secure his maiden victory of the season but also to send a message to Marquez - the young rider who had been making waves in the MotoGP circuit. For Lorenzo, this was a chance to regain some of his previously unmatched glory and to prove that despite the emergence of new talent, he remains a formidable force in the sport. At the end of the day, this dramatic encounter at Silverstone didn't just give the MotoGP fans a thrilling show, it also served as a stark reminder that in the sport of high-speed racing, nothing is predictable. A moment's lapse, a single misjudged turn as in the case of Marquez, can turn the tide in favor of your competitors. \\"After today's race, I know I need to pay special attention on the corners, especially when I am leading,\\" Marquez said. \\"It was a hard-learned lesson but definitely a valuable one.\\" Marquez however made it clear that his hopes for the championship weren't affected by this setback as he said, \\"The championship is long and rife with opportunities. Today was Lorenzo's day, but the next race might be mine.\\" The competition between Marquez and Lorenzo has added an extra layer of intrigue to the MotoGP. Despite having his winning streak snapped by Lorenzo at the British MotoGP, Marquez continues to inspire with his resilience and remarkable skill.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Which person studied less about the North American Cordillera? Answer:","response":"Alice studied less about the North American Cordillera. The North American Cordillera is a large region of alpine tundra that stretches across western North America, mainly in the United States and Canada. This region is located within the higher latitude range (approximately between 30 to 60°N), which is the area that Pam focused her studies on. Pam studied Earth's climate and vegetation in the high latitudes (70 to 50°N), which included a significant portion of the North American Cordillera. As the Cordillera lies within this latitude range, Pam's research would have covered a lot of information relating to this area - such as its unique alpine ecosystems, biodiversity, and the effects of climate change on this mountainous region. On the other hand, Alice studied the lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Although parts of the North American Cordillera do extend into the lower latitude range, the majority of the region falls within the higher latitude range that Pam studied. Therefore, Alice's research would have focused more on other areas within her latitude range, such as the Andes of South America or the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa. Moreover, the treeline roughly stays constant between 3,500 and 4,000 meters (11,500 and 13,100 ft) in the lower latitudes, while it changes significantly across the high latitudes, rising 75 meters (245 ft) per degree from 70 to 50°N. The treeline is an important factor in the study of alpine tundra, and given the greater variation at higher latitudes, Pam's studies would have involved more analysis and comparison of the North American Cordillera than Alice's studies. In summary, based on their respective research focus on different latitude ranges, Alice studied less about the North American Cordillera than Pam."},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

It was active from 1942 to 1976 under the Commander of the Fifth Naval District, based in Norfolk, Virginia. Hypothesis: USNTC Bainbridge is on the east coast Select from the following. 1. Yes 2. It's impossible to say 3. No","response":"1. Yes Based on the provided context, we can draw the hypothesis that the United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge (USNTC Bainbridge) is on the east coast. This conclusion can be reached by analyzing the geographical details mentioned in the text. The context states that USNTC Bainbridge was located in Port Deposit, Maryland. Maryland is a state on the east coast of the United States, and so, being located within Maryland suggests that the USNTC Bainbridge facility is also situated on the east coast. Additionally, the text highlights that the training center was located on the northeast bank of the Susquehanna River, which also supports the idea that it was on the east coast. Furthermore, USNTC Bainbridge was active under the Commander of the Fifth Naval District, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia. Virginia, like Maryland, is another state on the east coast of the United States. The command of the Fifth Naval District reinforces the east coast location of USNTC Bainbridge, as it seems logical that a facility on the east coast would fall under the jurisdiction of a nearby eastern-based naval district. Based on these geographical details, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that USNTC Bainbridge is on the east coast."},{"question":"This article: The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics.... contains an answer for the question: What is the location of the temple built in the style that is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features in 1200?, what is it ?

Please remove spaces between words.","response":"Uninstallation of software and its impact on wbemprox.dll: DLL, or Dynamic Link Library, files are essential components used by multiple programs to share functionality and resources. One such DLL file is wbemprox.dll; it is designed to support various applications in functioning correctly by providing them with necessary functions and data. Since several programs concurrently benefit from a single DLL file, problems can arise when you uninstall a program that may inadvertently delete the wbemprox.dll file. To understand this in more detail, let's delve deeper into why the deletion of wbemprox.dll might happen during the uninstallation process and how it can impact other programs on your system. 1. Shared components among programs: DLL files are created to allow multiple applications to access shared features without needing to include them in their individual codebases. This means that a single DLL file, such as wbemprox.dll, might be a necessary component for multiple installed applications, not just the one you are uninstalling. As a result, when you uninstall a program, the DLL files it uses may be mistakenly deleted alongside it, even if they are still required by other software on your computer. 2. Improper uninstallation procedures: Some uninstallation processes may not be thorough or adequately programmed, leading to the accidental deletion of essential DLL files like wbemprox.dll. This can be due to various reasons, such as human error during the creation of the uninstallation script, incomplete installation files, or miscommunication between various system components. 3. Consequences of accidental deletion: If wbemprox.dll is mistakenly deleted during the uninstallation of a program, other applications that depend on it may experience issues. Following the deletion, these programs might not function as intended, show error messages related to the missing dll file, or even crash altogether, leading to a negative user experience. To minimize the risk of accidentally deleting wbemprox.dll or other crucial DLL files during software uninstallation, consider adopting the following practices: 1. Use reliable uninstallation tools: Make use of a trustworthy uninstaller tool that can accurately recognize the software's shared components and refrain from deleting essential files that could affect other programs on your system. 2. Manually check dependencies: Double-check which files will be removed during the uninstallation process and verify if they are needed for the proper functioning of other applications. This may be time-consuming, but it helps avoid unintentional deletion of essential DLL files. 3. Reinstall or repair affected applications: If you have already accidentally deleted wbemprox.dll or other vital DLL files, try reinstalling the affected programs to see if the missing files are reinstalled alongside them. Alternatively, some applications offer repair options that automatically replace damaged or missing components, which can help restore functionality. By taking these precautions, you can ensure that unwanted side effects, such as the deletion of necessary files like wbemprox.dll, are avoided when uninstalling programs from your computer."},{"question":"Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose wife is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India? , can you please find it? In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia.

Kerry said here on Sunday that Saudi Arabia would support a US military strike as a way to punish the Syrian regime for using chemical weapons. Saudi Arabia would be the second country to support a US-led strike, although it is unclear whether the Saudis would provide any military assistance in the strike. The other country that has announced its support is France. “They have supported the strike, and they support taking action -- they believe that it’s very important to do that,” Kerry said about Saudi Arabia during a press conference here following his meetings with nine Arab foreign ministers and Arab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby. Kerry also had a one-on-one meeting on Sunday morning with Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal. Kerry, who arrived in London on Sunday afternoon and planned to have dinner with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, is planning to fly back to Washington on Monday and provide a closed-door briefing for the entire US House. He will brief the Senate later in the week. Congressional votes on the proposal to launch strikes against Syria are slated to begin Wednesday. “As a veteran of the congressional process, I’d just say to you that all of these early prognostications about how tough it is, or defeat here or whatever -- I think are just that,” Kerry said during a press conference on Sunday in Paris. “They’re early, and they’re not completely accurate.” “The vast majority of members of Congress, House and Senate, are undecided,” he added. “And that’s why…the briefings are taking place.” Kerry also said he was pleased with the release of a new video that shows the suffering that Syrians faced from the use of chemical weapons. “Those videos make it clear to people that these are real human beings, real children, parents being affected in ways that are unacceptable to anybody anywhere by any standards,” Kerry said. “And it is the United States of America that has always stood with others to say, ‘We will not allow this. This is not our values. This is not who we are.’” “I don’t think this case has been made enough -- to enough people,” he added. “This is not fantasy land, this is not conjecture,” he said at another point. “Bashir Al Assad has used chemical weapons at least 11 times or so, according to our best judgments.” Following the meeting with 10 Arab leaders, Kerry also said that “a number of countries” would within the next 24 hours would sign onto a strongly-worded statement that condemns the Syrian regime and calls on “a strong international response.” The statement, drafted by the United States and signed by 10 other countries at the Group of 20 summit, does not explicitly endorse military strikes. Germany on Saturday said it would sign on, and Qatar announced Sunday that it would, too. “I don’t believe the international community, if it really wanted to protect peace and security, can afford to stand still while an unarmed people is being attacked with these weapons,” Qatari foreign minister Khalid Al-Attiya said during a press conference with Kerry. “We call on all other countries to intervene to protect the Syrian people from what [they are] being subjected to,” he added. Al-Attiya would not say whether Qatar would provide military assets for a strike, saying only that his government “is currently studying with its friends and the United Nations what it could provide in order to protect the Syrian people.” It is still unclear is whether the United Nations will play a greater role. French President François Hollande said on Friday that he wanted to wait for a preliminary report from the UN inspectors. On Saturday, he said that he could seek a vote by the UN Security Council to vote. “The president and all of us are listening carefully to all of our friends,” Kerry said. “We will obviously take this under advisement and the president will make his decision at the appropriate period of time.” The US has said the UN would be hamstrung from acting because Russia, one of Syria’s strongest allies, would use its veto power to block any effort. But the US also needs to appease France if it is to mount strikes in concert with other countries. Kerry continued to make clear that any military strikes would be aimed at punishing Assad for using chemical weapons – and not at ousting him from office, even though the United States does want Assad to step down. “The end of this civil war is going to require a political solution…there is no military solution,” Kerry said. “We are not seeking to become engaged in or party to, or takeover, Syria’s civil war.” ||||| On the short list of seemingly intractable obstacles to President Barack Obama’s Syria plans: a war-weary nation, the feckless United Nations — and the Gregorian calendar. From the beginning, Obama’s recent Syria push has been hobbled by the calendar — and the scheduling snarls only get worse from here. Obama will sit Monday for interviews for six TV news programs, which will air within an hour of what had promised to be the week’s most highly anticipated Washington event: the NFL Redskins’ season opener against Philadelphia. Text Size - + reset McDonough's Sunday show blitz Syria: Timeline of crisis But while Obama traveled to Europe for the G-20 and a trip to Sweden last week, opinions on striking Syria have hardened. Scores of members of Congress have publicly come out against the use-of-force authorization, even as the administration has briefed, or offered briefings, for every member of Congress. Polls show Americans oppose intervention by large and growing margins. (Also on POLITICO: Undecided Dems key to Syria decision) If Monday Night Football pushed Obama’s address to the nation on Syria to Tuesday, odds are low for the president to have the nation’s attention to himself the rest of the week either. The Sept. 11 anniversary comes Wednesday, the same day the Senate could vote for cloture. Yom Kippur begins Friday night. Obama won’t even have Tuesday to himself. Hillary Clinton is due to deliver a speech that afternoon in Philadelphia. Voters in New York City will head to the polls for that city’s primary elections. And the new iPhone event scheduled for that day has become an annual media spectacle. (See POLITICO’s full Syria coverage) Then there are the seasonal realities to grapple with: Many Americans are spending time getting their children to start new school years — and the launch of a new fall TV season is underway, in an era when the nation already pays less attention to presidential addresses than during the days before 1,000-channel cable TV lineups. “How do you hold the attention of the American people when it is increasingly hard to do so with the distractions of the NFL season and religious holidays and back-to-school nights?” said Mike McCurry, a press secretary for Bill Clinton. “This is the challenge of the presidency, the ability to gather the nation around a common campfire is just not there anymore. You have to go for the sporadic bursts of attention and deal with the perpetual A.D.D. that people have.” Timing has worked against the White House from the very start. The Aug. 21 attack that prompted the administration to gear up for a Syria strike left Obama violating his predecessor’s key rule on selling the public on a war: Don’t do it in August. (Also on POLITICO: What would a Syria strike cost?) “From a marketing point of view,” George W. Bush chief of staff Andrew Card said in 2002 as that White House began its Iraq war sales pitch, ”you don’t introduce new products in August.” The Bush administration’s Iraq war rollout, which began that Sept. 11, included a war authorization vote on the eve of the midterm elections and lasted nearly six months. The brutality of Assad’s latest chemical weapons attack, which the White House has said killed 1,400 people near Damascus, didn’t allow the administration the luxury of waiting for anyone — be they members of Congress or the public — to return from summer vacation, said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama National Security Council spokesman who visited the White House last week to discuss Syria strategy with staffers there. “It takes time to get clarity on what exactly happened — you want them to think through what happened, and do consultation,” Vietor said Saturday. “The timing is what it is, there isn’t any way they could change that.” (VIDEO: VandeHei, Allen analysis on Syria situation) Still, the administration has done itself few favors in rolling out its case for striking the Assad regime. The push to attack Syria began in earnest the last week of August, with Congress gone and much of the American public trying to enjoy the final days of summer. By the time the administration finally presented its declassified evidence that Assad had gassed his own people and Secretary of State John Kerry made a definitive case for attacking the regime, it was the Friday afternoon before the Labor Day weekend. (Also on POLITICO: Obama to address the nation on Syria) “Syria didn’t sneak up on us three weeks ago,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a White House antagonist who opposes authorizing force against Syria. “This has been a growing problem for nearly two years. President Obama and Secretary [Hillary] Clinton totally failed from day one to deal with the problem, articulate a strategy and communicate with Congress.” ||||| Syria crisis: UK 'closely aligned' with US says Hague Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. William Hague says the UK and US remain \\"closely aligned\\" on Syria, after talks with his US counterpart John Kerry. The UK foreign secretary said the two were working together to save lives and revive peace talks as well as press for a strong response to the Assad government's use of chemical weapons. Mr Kerry said the risks of doing nothing were greater than acting. The two countries remained \\"true friends\\" despite the UK ruling out any military involvement, he insisted. Their meeting in London comes as the US tries to gather support for military strikes. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said that Parliament's vote last month means the UK will not join the US in any military action in response to Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons. Special relationship After talks with the US Secretary of State in London, Mr Hague said the UK's position was clear but stressed that the government remained \\"highly active\\" on the diplomatic and humanitarian front and supportive of Washington's position. He said 11 countries had signed a declaration following last week's G20 summit condemning the use of chemical weapons and calling for a robust response and urged other nations to follow suit to help increase pressure on the Syrian authorities. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Mr Kerry said the two countries' \\"special relationship\\" would not be affected by the UK's decision to reject military involvement, saying the bonds between the countries were \\"bigger than one vote or one moment in history\\". Quoting the late Baroness Thatcher, he said the US and UK were \\"real, true friends\\" and the transatlantic relationship was \\"as relevant today as it has been in the past\\". He dismissed suggestions that US President Obama had been forced to consult Congress after the UK Parliament rejected the case for a military response, suggesting he was intending to do this all the time and there was \\"no misinterpretation\\" of the British vote. He also said he understood why the legacy of Iraq made many MPs nervous about getting involved in another conflict, saying he would have been \\"highly sympathetic\\" to that view if he had not seen the \\"compelling evidence\\" of the Assad government's guilt. It \\"defied logic and common sense\\" to argue the opposition was responsible - as the Syrian authorities have claimed - and he defended the \\"limited\\" action the US was contemplating as being very different from the full-scale invasion of Iraq in 2003. \\"We are not talking about war. We are not going to war. We will not have people at risk in that way.\\" Asked what would stop the US from acting, he said the Assad government would have to provide full international access to its stockpile of chemical weapons - a move he believed was highly unlikely. 'Red line' The US secretary of state has warned that if there was no armed intervention Syria would use its chemical weapons again. But he also said the civil war in Syria could only be resolved by a political process. The US accuses President Bashar al-Assad's forces of killing 1,429 people in a sarin gas attack in Damascus on 21 August. Mr Assad's government blames the attack on rebels fighting to overthrow him in the country's two-and-a-half-year civil war. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said pictures of Mr Hague shoulder to shoulder with Mr Kerry could prove awkward for the Obama administration as it was a \\"vivid reminder\\" that a key ally had not been able to persuade its MPs of the need for action. He said the talks may focus on ways to boost elements of the Syrian Opposition seen as moderates, he added. Meanwhile, Mr Assad has reportedly again denied any link to the attack. In an interview with the US broadcaster PBS, to be broadcast on Monday, he also reportedly \\"suggested that there would be, among people that are aligned with him, some kind of retaliation if a strike was made\\", PBS said. 'Shaping response' France supports military intervention but it wants to wait for a report by UN weapons experts before taking action. In a statement to MPs on last week's G20 summit in St Petersburg, David Cameron said he hoped the report would be delivered soon.

He said the UK would continue to try and \\"shape\\" the diplomatic and humanitarian response to the crisis while also providing technical and political support to moderate opposition groups. Referring to the row during the G20 about reported comments by a senior Russian official about Britain's status, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he agreed with the PM that Britain was a \\"small island but a great nation\\" but added \\"it is a shame about the government\\". Mr Cameron, he added, had failed to win support in the UK for arming Syrian rebels and for a \\"rush to war\\" but that Parliament and the public would support a concentrated diplomatic and humanitarian effort to reduce suffering in Syria. ||||| CLOSE President Obama faces a daunting and uphill battle to win congressional authorization for a military strike on Syria, a USA TODAY Network survey of senators and representatives finds.

The comprehensive poll of Congress finds that only a small fraction of the 533 lawmakers — 22 senators and 22 House members — are willing to say they will support the use of force in response to the reported use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. Far more overall — 19 senators and 130 House members — say they will oppose a resolution that would authorize military strikes. There are two vacant seats in the House where lawmakers resigned and have not yet been replaced. The largest group of lawmakers remains undecided, including a majority of the Senate and the House. That could create an opportunity for the president to persuade them in a string of six interviews with TV network anchors Monday and a televised address to the nation Tuesday. The Senate could vote as early as Wednesday. GRAPHIC: Where members of Congress stand on Syria \\"We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria,\\" Obama said in his weekly radio address Saturday. \\"Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk that chemical weapons could be used again; that they would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us, and it would send a horrible signal to other nations that there would be no consequences for their use of these weapons. All of which would pose a serious threat to our national security.\\" White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough made the rounds of the morning talk shows Sunday, making the administration's case. STORY: Obama aide says concerns are understandable Congress isn't convinced. In the survey: •Democrats haven't fallen in line behind the president, at least not yet. Congressional Democrats are as likely to oppose the measure as support it, although most say they are undecided. At the moment, 28 Democrats support action; 28 oppose it. •Republicans who have made a decision overwhelmingly oppose Obama, by nearly 8-1. Sixteen Republicans support action; 121 oppose it. •In a majority of states, not a single member of Congress has gone on record endorsing the president's request for authorization of a military strike. That includes a dozen states that Obama carried in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections: Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. \\"I think it's an uphill slog from here,\\" House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., one of the handful of Republicans who supports the president, said on CBS' Face the Nation Sunday. He said the White House has \\"done an awful job\\" in explaining the reason for a strike and added, \\"It's a confusing mess.\\" On Fox News Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was horrified by images of the chemical weapons attacks in Syria but warned that the strikes could destabilize the country or even increase the odds that opposition forces obtain chemical weapons. \\"I don't think we're going to do anything to Assad,\\" he said of the Syrian leader. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said he has heard overwhelming opposition from his constituents. \\"And keep in mind, my district voted 77% for the president,\\" he said on CBS. \\"I think the president has work to do, but I think he can possibly get the votes. But he's got to come before the Congress and the nation.\\" On this issue, Obama hasn't been able to count on the classic partisan divide that has defined the capital's politics through his tenure. Some liberal Democrats have aligned with Republican libertarians to oppose a military strike. Some GOP hawks who typically oppose him (including Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom Obama beat for the White House in 2008) argue for action. Even African Americans in Congress, who have been among Obama's most reliable supporters on other issues, are resistant. Of 42 black lawmakers, two are committed to voting \\"yes.\\" STORY: Syria vote poses dilemma for black lawmakers \\"This is truly a momentous occasion in which the outcome is up for grabs,\\" says Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota.

In the Senate, the Post found 23 in favor, 17 opposed, 10 leaning no and 50 undecided; in the House, 25 in favor, 111 against, 116 leaning no and 181 undecided.

(Sept. 9) AP Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1fLDPmh ||||| The uphill fight to get Congress to approve a military strike on Syria is pushing President Barack Obama to embrace a brand of communication he’s long resisted: the delivery of a prime-time address to the nation from the White House. During his nearly five years in office, Obama has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid high-stakes, nighttime White House speeches. His advisers have repeatedly denigrated the value of Oval Office addresses, accusing promoters of such talks as being out of touch with modern media realities. Text Size - + reset Admin sticks to Syria talking points Obama's TV round-robin Now the president is preparing to deliver precisely such a high-profile address Tuesday night, giving in to pressure from lawmakers demanding a no-holds-barred White House effort to sell the public on the wisdom of a military response to Syria’s alleged chemical weapons use. And so a president who surged into the White House in no small part on the strength of his communication skills will need to turn in a particularly effective performance in a format that’s never been among his most favored. (PHOTOS: Syria: Where politicians stand) “I doubt the White House really believes in this moment that an Oval Office or White House address will be transformative, but they need to use everything in their arsenal, including sheer repetition,” said Jeff Shesol, a top speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. “If you’re asking members of Congress to get out on a limb and do something their constituents don’t want them to do, then it means you have to try it…I don’t think anyone believes in the mystical power of an Oval Office address or prime-time address. That power has been diminishing for a long time.” Former Obama speechwriting director Jon Favreau acknowledged that the White House has traditionally been eager to get the president out of the Oval Office to deliver speeches and in front of an audience wherever possible, but said this situation calls for a solo appearance. “We have been reluctant to do the Oval,” Favreau said in an interview. “I think this president is at his best when he’s feeding off a crowd and has got an audience in front of him, but I think this is a different case…To do something like this in front of a crowd — that seems political. The Oval becomes the best option.” (WATCH: A look back at past Oval Office addresses) Obama aides haven’t said exactly where in the White House the president will speak from Tuesday. In a Twitter exchange earlier this summer, a top Obama aide suggested Oval Office addresses aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. “This is an argument from the 80s,” Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer wrote during a back-and-forth about the prospect of a big speech on revelations about National Security Agency surveillance. “Ovals reach abt 1/3 the audience they did when Reagan did them.” However, Pfeiffer told POLITICO Saturday that he wasn’t declaring Oval Office speeches worthless, just asking people to be realistic about their power. “The point is that a nationally televised address is still the most powerful tool in the toolbox, but the audience size is greatly diminshed as media has changed. It is still a part of a strategy as opposed to a strategy in and of itself,” Pfeiffer said. “I was just pushing back against the idea that a national address meant the whole country heard what you had to say. It’s a tiny fraction nowadays. But that’s very different than being against them.” Some experts agree the mystique of the Oval Office address is tired, and showing its age. “In general, they’ve lost their wallop in terms of unifying the country around the strong voice of the commander in chief,” said Doug Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “People that were going to watch that on TV probably will now channel surf to a cable show or sports or something else…When it was the big three [networks], you didn’t have that luxury. It was shut off the TV or listen to the president.” If Obama does turn to the Oval Office for Tuesday night’s speech — and officials so far have said only that he will speak from somewhere in the White House — it will be a true rarity. As president, he has delivered only two addresses to the nation from his office, both in 2010: a speech about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and another about the end of combat in Iraq. “I personally have never loved the Oval,” Favreau added. “But I actually think it’s pretty right for this one.” A more popular choice for high-wattage Obama White House speeches has been the East Room — where he announced the death of Osama bin Laden — which allows for a presidential walk to the podium and for an audience when desired, or the Cross Hall, which can allow the president to be flanked by advisors. “You see the president in action, but when the president’s in the Oval Office he’s just sitting at his desk,” said Martha Kumar, a Towson University professor who has spent decades studying presidents’ communications operations. “Sometimes the desk looks like it’s about to swallow up a president.” But Kumar noted that presidents have used the Oval Office before to announce limited military actions of the kind the Obama White House says it has in mind for Syria. ||||| President Obama will begin an intensive public and private lobbying push this week to win congressional support for a limited missile strike against Syria, but even some of the strongest supporters on Capitol Hill for military action are pessimistic that the White House will succeed. Obama plans to meet with Senate Democrats on Tuesday, senior Senate aides said. Then millions of Americans will see him make his case during network television interviews Monday and a prime-time address from the White House on Tuesday in which the president, according to an administration official, will argue that not punishing Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad for his alleged use of chemical weapons would embolden his regime and his allies Hezbollah and Iran. Behind the scenes, Obama joined Vice President Biden on Sunday night for a family-style Italian dinner with about a dozen Republican senators at the vice president’s residence, while other senior officials were set Monday to offer closed-door briefings to the full House — the continuation of what White House officials described as a full-throttle effort to win over skeptical lawmakers in both parties. Yet several of the administration’s key backers on Syria said Sunday that the effort may be too little, too late, coming after a congressional recess in which lawmakers heard overwhelming opposition from constituents and had limited access to the classified information that formed the basis of the administration’s arguments. “It’s an open question today what the House would do,” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a supporter of limited military action. “The real challenge has been that members of Congress are scattered all over the country.” Two key Republican backers of Obama’s Syria position used Sunday television interviews to criticize the White House for what they call its inept lobbying effort and muddled strategy on Syria dating to the onset of that country’s civil war. Obama last year described the use of chemical weapons as a “red line” that would change his calculus on U.S. involvement in Syria. After U.S. findings that Assad used poison gas on Aug. 21, killing more than 1,400 people, including hundreds of children, Obama vowed a firm U.S. response. Then he surprised lawmakers when he said he would seek congressional authorization for a military strike. “The only thing more confusing to me [than] what their Syria strategy has been the last two years is their strategy to try to get buy-in by the representatives in Congress and the American people,” Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It is a confusing mess up to this point, and that has been, I think, their biggest challenge on what is an incredibly important issue.” Rogers said the White House did “an awful job explaining to the American people what is in our national security — what is the national United States interests in any level of engagement in a place like Syria.” Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Iraq war veteran elected as part of the tea-party wave of 2010, complained on ABC’s “This Week” and in a Washington Post interview Friday that the White House didn’t respond to his offer of help in recent days to rally support among skeptical Republicans for the Syria resolution. “We reached out to the White House and offered to help round up support, and haven’t heard back,” he said. “I don’t even know who my White House liaison is.” Kinzinger lamented on ABC that “it’s going to be very difficult for [Obama] to get votes,” pointing to the difficulty of the Syria conflict as well as the president’s cool relations with lawmakers in both parties. “You can’t begin to build a relationship with Congress for the first time when you need their support on something like this,” he said. Underscoring the White House’s heightened sensitivity to the challenge ahead in Congress, an official phoned Kinzinger within hours of his Sunday ABC appearance. Zach Hunter, the lawmaker’s spokesman, said the official “expressed a willingness to work together this week,” although neither Hunter nor a White House spokesman would say which official placed the call. The president’s arguments were previewed Sunday by his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, who used appearances on every major television network to make a case that appeared tailored to soothe skeptical liberals and foreign policy hawks alike — focusing on the human catastrophe of a mass chemical attack as well as the potential fallout for the United States and its allies if Assad goes unpunished. McDonough referred repeatedly to graphic videos released Saturday showing what officials said was the aftermath of the Syrian poison gas attack in the Damascus suburbs. And he argued that the lack of a U.S. response would strengthen other American foes, including Iran. “The question now is, for Congress to resolve this week is: Are there consequences for a dictator who would have used those weapons to gas to death hundreds of children?” McDonough asked during his appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” “The answer to that question . . . will be followed closely in Damascus, but will also be followed closely in Tehran, among Lebanese Hezbollah, and others. So, this is a very important week.” In the past two weeks, according to officials, the administration has held discussions with at least 85 senators and more than 165 House members. Much of the White House’s attention has focused on House Democrats, with McDonough, Biden and others holding conversations with members of the Progressive Caucus, members of the Hispanic Caucus and Jewish lawmakers. National security adviser Susan E. Rice will meet this week with the Congressional Black Caucus. Van Hollen said he participated in a three-hour session with Biden on Friday in the White House Situation Room aimed at persuading undecided Democrats. But, Van Hollen said, challenges remain with Democrats. He pointed to concern among many on the left about language in the resolution approved last week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and pushed by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), describing U.S. policy as seeking to “change the momentum” of the Syria conflict and topple Assad. The intent was to give the Obama administration a broader hand in pursuing its military strategy in Syria. “There are many of us who are very worried about the United States getting more entangled in the Syrian civil war,” said Van Hollen, who has co-sponsored an alternative resolution backing a more limited action. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) wrote on his Facebook page Thursday that, despite a week of briefings from numerous top officials, including Rice, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “I am still not convinced of the wisdom of a U.S. missile strike in Syria.” He added on Twitter: “Tally from constituents calling my office, emailing, and writing about Syria: 1135 opposed to U.S. action, 18 for.” The White House’s difficulties in Congress are evident in the latest Washington Post whip count. As of Sunday, 227 House members either opposed or leaned against military action, while 181 remained undecided and just 25 were in favor. Twenty-seven senators were opposed or leaning against, with 23 in favor and 50 undecided. On Sunday, after hearing McDonough make the administration’s case, some Democrats remained wary. Moments after McDonough spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), who voted against the Senate resolution in last week’s Foreign Relations Committee meeting, said: “I ­haven’t changed my mind.” Udall said he did not question the evidence of the chemical weapons attack — only whether the administration was choosing the best course of action. “The American people don’t want to be embroiled in a Middle Eastern civil war,” Udall told NBC’s David Gregory. Udall added that the United States could take stronger diplomatic action, such as continuing to work for broader action by the United Nations. “I’m very disappointed that the administration has given up — they have given up on the United Nations and on rallying the world,” he said. Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.), saying she was leaning against supporting a military strike, said on NBC that she questioned the direct U.S. national security interest. “I haven’t heard that Assad wants to use weapons against us,” she said. “I haven’t heard that he wants to use weapons against our allies, that he’s moving them to terrorist organizations. So I’m asking, where is the national security issue?” Ed O’Keefe and Paul Kane contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","response":"In a meeting with Arab foreign ministers, Secretary of State John F.

General Yoav Galant the top job in Israel’s Army and a reputation earned over more than 3 decades of military service. Like a lot of scandals it started with something that was unsavory behavior; the actual nail in the coffin was lying about it. Essentially, a few years ago, he built a big very fancy house, a parking lot, and some other stuff on a large plot of land. Only problem is he didn’t technically own all of the land. According to reports here he exploited a very complicated part of Israeli law that allowed him build on the land 2-years-ago the media picked up the story but it was confusing and nobody really cared. The government however launched an investigation into what happened and according to the Special Prosecutor in the case Galant lied. Again nobody said much until Defense Minister Ehud Barak appointed Galant “Chief of Staff,” the Israeli Military’s top job. The media went crazy looking into exactly what happened with that house, the land, and the parking lot. How could someone have the Military’s top job who couldn’t tell the truth about his house? Nobody had a good answer for that and finally the Prime Minister stepped in and pulled the nomination. Now comes a major problem. Galant was supposed to take office February 14th. The current Chief of Staff has to leave February 14th. That wouldn’t be a huge problem ordinarily but right now isn’t an ordiary time in the Middle East. On Israel’s southern boarder the Jewish State’s most important ally, Egypt, is descending into chaos. On the Northern border, Hezbollah just took over Lebanon and to the East King Abdullah is fighting to keep control of Jordan. 12 days from now Israel’s Military will be leaderless. Either problem isn’t good but combining the crisis in the Middle East and the crisis of not being able to simply tell the truth has Israel in a rather precarious stop. Of course, Barak could take over, he is a military hero, as is his boss the Prime Minister but this isn’t wartime, yet, so they named a new guy. They are going to the bench, pulling out from retirement the General that Barak passed over when he named his friend Galant as Chief of Staff. Wonder what his house looks like? What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The text highlights a significant crisis in Israel's military leadership and the country's geopolitical context. The central issue is the dismissal of Maj. General Yoav Galant from consideration for \\"Chief of Staff\\" - the top post in Israel’s Army - due to personal scandals. Galant's reputation was marred by a scandal where he reportedly exploited a complicated law to build property on land he did not own, lying about it when questioned during investigations. When the media picked up on this story, public outcry escalated, forcing the Prime Minister to withdraw Galant's nomination. The timing of the crisis becomes particularly problematic as Israel's military would be without a designated leader amidst a turbulent geopolitical environment. Countries around Israel, such as Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan, are going through their respective crises, adding urgency and concern to the leadership vacuum within the Israeli military.

The fifth book sold 300,000 copies. The fourth book sold 150,000 copies. The first book sold 6,000 copies. Now we can add the fourth book's sales to the first book's sales, which is 150,000 + 6,000 = 156,000. To find the difference, subtract the combined sales of the first and fourth books from the sales of the fifth book: 300,000 (fifth book sales) - 156,000 (combined first and fourth book sales) = 144,000. So, the fifth book sold 144,000 more copies than the first and fourth books combined."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What action against Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as doing the same to 70 Christians? Context: Muslim sects regarded as heretical, such as the Druze, Ismailis, Alevis, and Alawites, ranked below Jews and Christians. In 1514, Sultan Selim I, nicknamed \\"the Grim\\" because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis (Qizilbash), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that \\"the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\"[page needed] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East, especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which included much of the region. With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389). The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France. The answer to this question is:","response":"The killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians."},{"question":"Article: An absolute phrase, also called a nominative absolute, modifies the entire sentence. While they usually come before the rest of the sentence, they may also come after the main clause. An absolute phrase usually has its own subject and is generally formed with a \\"noun\\" and a \\"participle\\" (an \\"-ing\\" or \\"-ed\\" word). Here is an example of an absolute phrase beginning a sentence: “Her homework completed, Sujata left to meet her friends.” Here is an example of an absolute phrase concluding a sentence: “The couple hurried home, the cold nipping at their faces.” This phrase modifies the entire main clause before it. Adverbial clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions, which connect the clause to the main sentence. Adverbial clauses are always dependent because of these conjunctions, and they cannot stand on their own. They may be placed at the beginning of the sentence or elsewhere. Common subordinating conjunctions include because, although, whereas, unless and since. For example, here is an adverb clause that begins a sentence: “Because your input at the group meetings is always creative and insightful, I'm putting you in charge of the project.” Here is an adverb clause later in a sentence: “Joe decided not to ride on the roller coaster, even though he enjoyed it, because he had just eaten a huge chili dog.” If you have a series of three or more items, use commas to separate each item. For example, here is a list separated by commas: “At the store I will buy apples, oranges, pears, and bananas.” Do not place commas before or after the list or series. This comma usage is incorrect, as shown in this example: “At the store I will buy, apples, oranges, pears, and bananas, to make fruit salad tonight.” Do not use commas when all the items in a series are linked by and, or, or nor. For example, here is a list of items linked by and: “Kyle and Spike and Brenda and Willow all went to the concert.” If all of the items in your series are phrases instead of single words, or if the items in your list contain commas, it is acceptable to use semicolons to separate the items instead of commas: “You have a choice of two breakfasts: granola, orange juice, and coffee, which is fairly cheap; or bacon, sausage, and eggs, which is more expensive.” ” The Oxford comma (also known as the Harvard comma) is a comma placed before the final item in a list or series. It is the topic of some debate, with some people advocating against it and others insisting that it always be used. The goal of the Oxford comma is clarity, so use it when the last two items in your series should be clearly separated. For example, consider this sentence: “I would like to dedicate this book to my parents, my professor and John F. Kennedy.” With this punctuation, it looks as though your parents are your professor and John F. Kennedy. Using the Oxford comma will prevent this confusion: “I would like to dedicate this book to my parents, my professor, and John F. Kennedy.” Using an Oxford comma will never be grammatically incorrect, so if you’re unsure whether you need it, use it anyway. Here's how to know whether the adjectives are functioning independently: If you could insert the word \\"and\\" between the adjectives without changing the meaning of the sentence (or producing gibberish), they are functioning independently and a comma should separate them. For example, here is a sentence with a series of adjectives that is punctuated correctly: People who purposefully misuse grammar are brutish, irresponsible, mean-spirited troglodytes who mangle our beautiful, versatile language. Some word pairs act as a single word (disc jockey, young man). Commas are not necessary with these. Do not use a comma if the adjectives are joined by a conjunction! Do not use a comma if the adjectives are of unequal weight; for example, if one of the adjectives is a color or number and the other is a quality, you would not use a comma. For example, \\"I have a big red wagon\\" would not take commas, while \\"I have a rusty, well-loved wagon\\" would. Each of the elements in a date (weekday, month and day, and year) should be separated by a comma. Also use a comma to separate the elements in an address, or when referring to a city and state or country. For example, you would use a comma in this sentence: “I love to visit Tokyo, Japan.” Here is an example of correct comma usage for a date: “This WikiHow was written on Monday, May 14th, 2007, in Maryland.” When only the month and year appear, do NOT use a comma: “I wrote this article sometime in May 2007.” Here is an example of correct comma usage for an address: “Her new address is 1234 Main Street, Anytown, Maryland, 12345.” When the elements of the address are joined by a preposition, no commas are needed: “It is on Highway 10 near Pensacola in Florida.” The salutation is the greeting at the beginning of a letter, such as \\"Dear John.\\" The closing greeting should also be set off with a comma: \\"Sincerely yours, Hakim.\\" When writing business letters, it is customary to use a colon rather than a comma: \\"To Whom It May Concern: [body of letter]\\" What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a brief statement or account of the main points of a piece of writing, such as an article or a book.

The main pieces of information are the order of the books and their relationship to each other. 1. First, I identify the books in the sentence: Castle, Aenir, Above the Veil, and Into Battle. 2. Then, I recognize the relationships among the books: Castle precedes Aenir, Aenir is followed by Above the Veil, and Above the Veil is followed by Into Battle. 3. Now, I'll represent these relationships as triples using the format (Subject, Predicate, Object): Triple 1: Subject: Castle Predicate: precedes Object: Aenir Explanation: The first triple represents the relationship between Castle and Aenir, which is Castle preceding Aenir. Triple 2: Subject: Aenir Predicate: is followed by Object: Above the Veil Explanation: The second triple represents the relationship between Aenir and Above the Veil, which is Aenir being followed by Above the Veil. Triple 3: Subject: Above the Veil Predicate: is followed by Object: Into Battle Explanation: The third triple represents the relationship between Above the Veil and Into Battle, which is Above the Veil being followed by Into Battle.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: take away their food B: tell them the specials C: out of curiousity A:","response":"The best answer according to the context would be B: tell them the specials. As Kai is at a restaurant and has just asked the waiter about the specials, it is most likely that other customers would be interested in knowing the specials as well. When dining out, many people are curious about the unique or featured dishes being offered by the restaurant, as these specials often showcase the chef's creativity and fresh, seasonal ingredients. This is an important aspect of the dining experience for many individuals, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that others would want to know about the specials too. Option A, \\"take away their food,\\" does not fit the context, as the situation described does not suggest that the customers' food has already arrived or is ready to be taken away. Furthermore, this answer does not relate to Kai asking about the specials or other customers showing interest in them. Option C, \\"out of curiosity,\\" is not a direct answer to the question, \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" While it does express the idea that people might be curious about the specials, it does not clearly establish what the other customers would want to do in response to this curiosity. In conclusion, answer B, \\"tell them the specials,\\" is the most appropriate answer according to the context provided. When dining at a restaurant, people are naturally interested in knowing about the specials being offered, which can enhance their enjoyment and satisfaction with their dining experience."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

Not far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the \\"real\\" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht.

The Baron wanders backstage, where the Angel of Death tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall yelling for the Turkish army to go away, and the Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death once again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway. The balloon...

The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

The United Nations on Wednesday said it has expanded an investigation of new allegations ofsexual exploitation and abuse by foreign peacekeepers in Central African Republic (CAR) and notified authorities in France, Gabon and Burundi about the accusations against their troops. “The Secretary-General (Ban Ki-moon) is shocked to the core by the latest allegations of abuse in the Central African Republic,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. UN Audit Identifies Serious Lapses Linked to Alleged Bribery U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein echoed Ban’s sentiments, calling the charges “sickening” and insisting the U.N. investigation “must leave no stone unturned.” Dujarric said U.N. officials interviewed some 108 alleged victims, the “vast majority” of whom are minors. He described the allegations of sexual abuse between 2013 and 2015 as “despicable, depraved and deeply disturbing” and said the U.N. was doing what it can to investigate. There have been dozens of such accusations against peacekeepers in CAR, where MINUSCA assumed authority from African Union troops in September 2014. France has been investigating allegations against its Sangaris force, which is not under U.N. command, since last year. The Code Blue Campaign run by the advocacy group AIDS-Free World issued a statement on Wednesday citing information from interviews with victims conducted by MINUSCA, the U.N. mission in CAR. HIV Could Be Cured Within Three Years U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, currently in CAR, issued a statement describing the allegations as “sickening.” “This plague of sexual abuse by peacekeepers must stop,” she said. French Ambassador Francois Delattre said the allegations are “sickening and odious.” “The French authorities are determined to shed full light on these grave allegations,” he said. The U.N. has pledged to crack down on sex abuse allegations to avoid a repeat of past mistakes. MINUSCA’s previous head, Babacar Gaye, resigned last August and some 800 Congolese peacekeepers were repatriated last month. In December, an independent review panel accused the U.N. and its agencies of grossly mishandling allegations of child sexual abuse and rape by peacekeepers in CAR in 2013 and 2014. ||||| Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India major peacekeeping contributors but amongst most prone to corruption New York – 4th April 2016 - The top 30 Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) to UN peacekeeping operations are amongst those most at risk of defence corruption, according to new research from Transparency International. Bangladesh, India and Ethiopia make up over one quarter of all UN peacekeeping troops, yet have been judged to be at either a very high or high risk of corruption in their armed forces. Transparency International’s Government Defence Corruption Index graded states from A to F on their risk of defence corruption, with A representing the best and F the lowest end of the scale. Of the top 30 TCC’s only Italy (C) scores higher than a D, whilst six states received F grades, meaning they are at a critical risk of defence corruption. The UN relies on individual TCC’s to discipline misconduct by troops whilst on missions, yet there is no evidence that breaches of codes of conduct such as engaging in corrupt activities are addressed. Katherine Dixon, Director Transparency International Defence and Security Programme, said: “UN peacekeepers operate in some of the most fragile environments in the world, so it is extremely concerning that the majority of defence forces contributing to operations are at such a high risk of corruption. This does little to instil confidence that troops on the ground are behaving with integrity. And recent allegations of gross misconduct carried out by peacekeeping troops prove just how real the threat is. We continue to support the UN’s efforts to ensure that those deployed on peace operations set the highest standards and do not risk contributing to the instability they’re trying to stop. But we should be under no illusions that this is a tough challenge.” Major Troop Contributing Countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Morocco, Rwanda, and South Africa, do not train their troops and commanders on how to fight corruption in mission environments before they deploy. Corruption drives conflict and instability; it provides financing for organised criminal groups, leads to public distrust in state institutions and intervention forces, and can lead to violent extremism. Corruption poses a direct threat to the successful implementation of peacekeeping mandates. ||||| KINSHASA (Reuters) - The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Democratic Republic of Congo said late on Friday that it has received allegations of sexual abuse against Tanzanian peacekeepers based in Congo’s northeast, the latest in a series of such accusations against U.N. forces. The mission said in a statement that it received the allegations against members of its Force Intervention Brigade, tasked with offensive operations, in the village of Mavivi on March 23 and immediately launched an investigation. “Initial results suggest that there is evidence of transactional sex and sex with minors,” the statement said. “There are also a number of paternity claims.” The statement did not say how many cases of abuse had been alleged or provide any further details about the accusations. U.N. peacekeeping missions have been beset by accusations of sexual abuse. The United Nations reported 99 such allegations against staff members across the U.N. system last year. The United Nations said this week that it has expanded an investigation into new allegations of sexual abuse by foreign peacekeepers in Central African Republic. U.N. officials said they have interviewed some 108 alleged victims, most of them minors. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, which was initially put in place during a civil war that took place in 1998-2003, is the world’s largest, with around 20,000 uniformed personnel. The Security Council renewed its mandate earlier this week for one year. |||||","response":"The United Nations (UN) has announced an investigation into fresh allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, largely against minors, by foreign peacekeepers in the Central African Republic (CAR) between 2013 and 2015. The allegations involve peacekeepers from France, Gabon and Burundi, and have been described by UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, as “despicable, depraved and deeply disturbing”. The revelations echo recent findings by Transparency International that the top 30 Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) to UN peacekeeping operations are at high risk of defence corruption. Meanwhile, separate abuse allegations have emerged against Tanzanian UN peacekeepers based in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The mission’s statement suggests there is evidence of transactional sex and sex with minors, and the allegations are the latest in a series of accusations against UN forces."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Passage: Merivale was the second son of John Herman Merivale (1770–1844) and Louisa Heath Drury, daughter of Joseph Drury, headmaster of Harrow. He was educated at Harrow School under George Butler from 1818 to 1824, where his chief schoolfriends were Charles Wordsworth and Richard Chenevix Trench. He took part in the Eton versus Harrow cricket match in 1824. In 1824 he was offered a post in the Indian civil service, and went for a short time to Haileybury College, where he did well in Oriental languages. Deciding against an Indian career, he went up to St John's College, Cambridge in 1826. Among other distinctions he came out as fourth classic in 1830, and in 1833 was elected fellow of St John's. He was a member of the Apostles' Club, his fellow-members including Tennyson, A. H. Hallam, Monckton Milnes, W. H. Thompson, Trench and James Spedding. Merivale was the main protagonist on the Cambridge side in instigating the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race held at Henley on Thames in 1829. He rowed at number four in the Cambridge boat in the race which Oxford won.

These cilia play a crucial role in numerous processes, such as filtering and moving substances, and supporting the respiratory function. The following are some major areas where ciliated epithelial tissue can be found in the body: 1. Respiratory System - One of the most significant locations of the ciliated epithelial tissue in the human body is the respiratory system. It lines the airways such as trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The ciliated epithelium in the respiratory system is typically composed of pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells, featuring microscopic cilia on their surface. These cilia function to move and filter mucus, dust, and other foreign particles trapped in the mucus layer, helping to keep the airways clean and free of any debris and germs. Eventually, the mucus is either coughed up or swallowed and digested in the stomach, preventing infections that could arise from the build-up of pathogens. 2. Female Reproductive System - In the female reproductive system, ciliated epithelial tissue is found lining the fallopian tubes (oviducts). This tissue features both ciliated and non-ciliated columnar epithelial cells. The presence of cilia in the oviduct plays a critical role in moving the ovum (egg) from the ovary to the uterus. The coordinated motion of the cilia, along with the muscular contractions of the fallopian tubes, helps facilitate the journey of the ovum as well as the sperm during fertilization. 3. Male Reproductive System - The epididymis, part of the male reproductive system involved in sperm maturation and storage, is also lined with ciliated epithelial tissue. The ciliated epithelium in the epididymis is composed of pseudostratified columnar cells with cilia and stereocilia that play a fundamental role in supporting the movement and absorption of testicular fluid and nutrients, which aids in sperm maturation and transport. 4. Ventricles of the Brain - Ciliated epithelial cells are found in the ependymal layer that lines the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. The cilia help in the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is vital for proper brain functioning. The motion of cilia ensures the appropriate circulation and distribution of CSF through the brain, providing nutrients, removing waste products, and cushioning the nervous system structures. 5. Nasal Cavity - Ciliated epithelium can also be found in the nasal cavity, specifically in the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages. Similar to the respiratory tract, the cilia found in the nasal cavity help to clear mucus secretions and filter out any foreign particles and pathogens, thereby maintaining proper respiratory hygiene and preventing infections. In summary, ciliated epithelial tissue plays crucial roles in several human body functions. It is primarily found in the respiratory system, female and male reproductive systems, ventricles of the brain, and the nasal cavity. These tissues perform essential tasks like moving and filtering substances, protecting against infections, and facilitating important biological processes, making them vital components of the human body's overall function."},{"question":"Student: If \\"2 people in africa wait for food.\\" does that mean that \\"2 people in south africa wait for food.\\"?

Section C elements are located at the top, but section D elements are located at the bottom. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which section would have weaker nulcear charge, section A or section B? Hint: Electronegativities generally increase from left to right across a period. This is due to an increase in nuclear charge. Alkali metals have the lowest electronegativities, while halogens have the highest. Because most noble gases do not form compounds, they do not have electronegativities. Note that there is little variation among the transition metals. Electronegativities generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size. Answer:","response":"Given the information, the periodic table has been divided into sections where Section A elements are positioned on the left, and Section B elements are on the right of the table. According to the details provided, electronegativity generally increases from left to right across a period. This is mainly due to an increase in nuclear charge. This implies that the elements in Section A, being on the left, would generally have a weaker nuclear charge compared to those in Section B on the right. Alkali metals, which are located in Group 1 of the periodic table, and hence in Section A according to the provided categorization, have the lowest electronegativities. This further supports the idea that Section A has a weaker nuclear charge, as lower electronegativity is indicative of weaker nuclear charge. On the other hand, halogens, which are located in Group 17, towards the right of the periodic table, and hence fall in Section B as per the given classification, have the highest electronegativities. This supports the concept that the elements in Section B have a stronger nuclear charge. Also, it's noted that electronegativities decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the larger atomic size. This stipulation, although not directly relevant to the comparison between sections A and B (which are differentiated horizontally), provides further context to the way electronegativities and nuclear charges vary across the periodic table. In conclusion, based on the explanation of the trends of electronegativity and nuclear charge across the periodic table, Section A, represented by elements in the left-hand side of the periodic table, would have a weaker nuclear charge as compared to Section B, represented by elements on the right."},{"question":"Here is a premise: yeah they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean Here is a hypothesis: Besides them being probably overwhelmed, they're also losing their jobs in the process.

This storm has resulted in a cyclone. The radius of outermost closed isobar is measured to be 1.5 degrees of latitude. and a hint : There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft). Please answer this question : Given the cyclone increases in size will the measurement of its outermost isobar have increased or decreased?","response":"If the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its outermost isobar will also increase. This is because the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI) is one of the metrics used to measure the size of a storm. As the storm expands and covers a larger area, the outermost isobar that encloses the region experiencing a specific atmospheric pressure will also expand, resulting in an increased radius. An increase in the ROCI signifies that the cyclone's influence is extending over a larger area, and it is also indicative of the overall size of the storm system. In general, larger storms can impact more significant areas for more extended periods, thereby leading to potentially higher damage caused by intense winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. To summarize, given that the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its outermost closed isobar will also increase, reflecting the expansion of the storm system and its potential impact on larger areas."},{"question":"Determine the sentiment: Hearing about how hilarious this movie is, I finally rent it at the video store and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times.

Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.

Foot: A foot is not typically something we eat, so it's not a viable answer. b. Sandal: A sandal is a type of footwear, and we don't eat footwear, so this option is also not a viable answer. c. Loaf of bread: A loaf of bread is something we eat, and it has a part called the 'heel' - which refers to the end slice of the loaf. Based on this, loaf of bread seems like a viable answer. d. Shoe: A shoe, like a sandal, is a type of footwear and not something we eat. Therefore, not a viable answer. e. Boot: Again, a boot is also a type of footwear and not something we eat.

At a certain point in the expected celebrations, confetti mimicking glass shards was meant to fall from the sky, a symbol of the candidate reaching feminism’s peak — breaking the glass ceiling that held women back from achieving the highest position in the country. Of course, things didn’t turn out exactly as planned. But even if they had, it’s up for debate whether Hillary Clinton and those like her adequately represent the needs and nuance of the feminist movement today. Feminism has always been subject to critique, but it seems that recent commentary has become much harsher. Some ask whether feminism as popularly understood today has been co-opted to represent only the concerns of its most privileged advocates. When Sheryl Sandberg’s “Lean In” was published in 2013, it was lauded by many but instantly faced backlash. Many felt that it devalued those women who did not work outside the home or for whom career success was not the highest ambition, while also enshrining achievement within a market-based, capitalist system as what should be women’s highest goal. In fact, the success of Sandberg’s model (and perhaps some of Clinton’s achievement as well) rested on the underpaid labor of those with fewer resources — the nannies, housekeepers and others who would in the end perform the undervalued, underpaid and still traditionally female work of caring for others. For all of the book’s supposedly feminist bona fides, it spoke primarily to one elite group of women whose struggles were not those of the majority. A number of those who voiced complaint were women of color, for whom exclusion from the feminist narrative has been a long-running grievance. In many cases, their concerns — about racism, classism and other forms of oppression — have been asked to take a backseat to other goals from the very beginning of the movement. And they did not see themselves adequately represented by figures such as Lena Dunham, whose supposed progressiveness doesn’t seem to stretch quite far enough to take into account their presence. Then, of course, there is the perception that the feminist movement’s main concerns are to the left of the culture-war debates. Mainstream feminism often seems unquestioning in its support for easily accessible abortion, a re-imagining of gender roles and — though perhaps in jest — a denigration of men. This impression has left many women, especially those who identify as religious or conservative, unwilling to identify with the label. It’s certainly a stretch to see Donald Trump’s electoral win as anything other than a net negative for women, but the fact that 42 percent of women voted for him (compared with the 44 percent of women who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012) indicates that something may have gone amiss with Clinton’s supposedly mainstream feminist message and the way the movement is represented. Does feminism suffer from elitism? Has it lost touch with conservative, minority or working-class Americans? How can feminists build a platform that attracts more broad-based support? Over the next few days, we’ll hear from: Ai-Jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance Shamira Ibrahim, writer at VerySmartBrothas Write a title for it.","response":"Why Some People Think Feminism Only Helps Certain Women"},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who assisted Bevel, King, and the SCLC to lead the Selma to Montgomery marches? is inside the article: Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.

Firstly, he proposed a correction to the length of the year. The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March. How much difference does the extra 11 minutes make over 400 years time?","response":"To calculate the difference that the extra 11 minutes make over 400 years, we need to consider the following information from the article: - The Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. - The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. - The average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days. First, let's find the difference in time between the Julian year and the mean tropical year in minutes: Difference in time (in minutes) = (365.25 days - 365.24219 days) * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour Difference in time (in minutes) ≈ 11.06 minutes Now let's find how much this difference accumulates over 400 years: Accumulated difference (in minutes) = 11.06 minutes/year * 400 years Accumulated difference (in minutes) ≈ 4424 minutes Now we will convert the accumulated difference to days: Accumulated difference (in days) = 4424 minutes / 60 minutes/hour / 24 hours/day Accumulated difference (in days) ≈ 3.07 days Thus, the extra 11 minutes make a difference of approximately 3.07 days over 400 years' time."},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. I am facing a new situation today: Beach town was hit hard by the hurricane. Hill town was spared, being situated 50 miles south. the eye of the hurricane passed almost through Beach town. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which town had less damage caused by low pressure eye of the hurricane?","response":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can deduce that Hill town had less damage caused by the low pressure eye of the hurricane. Below is a detailed explanation of the reasons behind this conclusion. 1. Storm Surge Impact: The low pressure eye of the hurricane is responsible for the formation of storm surges, which are very high waters that can cause severe flooding when they reach land. Beach town, which was directly hit by the hurricane, would have experienced a significant storm surge. On the other hand, Hill town was situated 50 miles south and did not experience the direct impact of the hurricane's low pressure eye, so it likely faced a significantly reduced storm surge risk. 2. Influence of High Tide: The background article suggests that if a storm occurs during a high tide, the water will rise even higher, potentially causing more damage. Beach town, being located right on the coast, is subject to the effects of tides, whereas Hill town, which is further inland, would be less susceptible to these fluctuations and their potential impact on storm surge effects. 3. High Wind and Waves: Hurricanes deliver strong winds which can create very large waves. Beach town experienced the direct impact of the hurricane's eye, where these conditions create a dangerous combination of high waves atop storm surges. This would result in even more flooding and subsequent damage in Beach town as compared to Hill town. While Hill town might experience high winds from being in the vicinity of the hurricane, it would not face the same magnitude of damage caused by the low pressure eye and the intense storm surge. 4. Topography: Hill town is likely situated at a higher elevation than Beach town, as the names of the towns suggest. This topographic difference decreases the risk of flooding in Hill town compared to Beach town, which is more susceptible to damage due to a storm surge and its location along the shoreline. In summary, considering the factors of storm surge impact, tidal influence, high winds and waves, and topography, it is reasonable to conclude that Hill town suffered less damage caused by the low pressure eye of the hurricane than Beach town."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given music product reviews in German language.

Many people are using mobile dating applications to find their “special someones.” In fact, a recent Pew Research study found that 1 in 10 Americans have used a dating site or application, and the number of people who have dated someone they met online has grown to 66 percent over the past eight years. Even though many dating applications are relatively new to the market, Pew Research also found that an astonishing 5 percent of Americans who are in a marriage or committed relationship met their significant other online. As the number of dating applications and registered users grows, so does their attractiveness to potential attackers. Powered by IBM Application Security on Cloud technology, a recent IBM analysis of dating applications revealed the following: Nearly 60 percent of leading mobile dating applications they studied on the Android mobile platform are vulnerable to potential cyberattacks that could put personal user information and organizational data at risk. For 50 percent of enterprises IBM analyzed, employee-installed popular dating applications were present on mobile devices that had access to confidential business data. The goal of this blog is not to discourage you from using these applications. Rather, its goal is to educate organizations and their users on potential risks and mobile security best practices to use the applications safely. Potential Exploits in Dating Apps The vulnerabilities IBM discovered are more powerful than you might suspect. Some of them make it possible for cybercriminals to collect valuable personal information about you. Even though certain applications employ privacy measures, IBM found that many are vulnerable to attacks, which can let cybercriminals do the following: Use GPS Information to Track Your Movements: IBM found that 73 percent of the 41 popular dating applications analyzed have access to current and historical GPS location information. Cybercriminals may capture your current and former GPS location details to find out where you live, work or spend most of your day. Control Your Phone’s Camera or Microphone: Several identified vulnerabilities let cybercriminals gain access to your phone’s camera or microphone even when you aren’t logged in to dating applications. Such vulnerabilities can let attackers spy and eavesdrop on your personal activities or tap into data you capture on your cell phone camera in confidential business meetings. Several identified vulnerabilities let cybercriminals gain access to your phone’s camera or microphone even when you aren’t logged in to dating applications. Such vulnerabilities can let attackers spy and eavesdrop on your personal activities or tap into data you capture on your cell phone camera in confidential business meetings. Hijack Your Dating Profile: A cybercriminal can change content and images on your dating profile, impersonate you, communicate with other application users from your account or leak personal information that could tarnish your personal and/or professional reputation. How Do Attackers Exploit These Vulnerabilities? Which specific vulnerabilities enable attackers to carry out the exploits mentioned above, permitting them to gain access to your confidential information? IBM’s security researchers determined 26 of the 41 dating applications analyzed on the Android mobile platform either had medium- or high-severity vulnerabilities, which included the following: Cross-Site Scripting Attacks via Man in the Middle: This vulnerability can act as a gateway for attackers to gain access to mobile applications and other features on your devices. It can permit an attacker to intercept cookies and other information from your application via an insecure Wi-Fi connection or rogue access point, and then tap into other devices features the app has access to, such as your camera, GPS and microphone.

It can permit an attacker to intercept cookies and other information from your application via an insecure Wi-Fi connection or rogue access point, and then tap into other devices features the app has access to, such as your camera, GPS and microphone. Debug Flag-Enabled Exploits: If Debug Flag is enabled on an application, it means a debug-enabled application on an Android device may attach to another application and read or write to the application’s memory. The attacker can then intercept information that flows into the application, modify its actions and inject malicious data into it and out of it. If Debug Flag is enabled on an application, it means a debug-enabled application on an Android device may attach to another application and read or write to the application’s memory. The attacker can then intercept information that flows into the application, modify its actions and inject malicious data into it and out of it. Phishing Attacks via Man in the Middle: Attackers can offer up a fake login screen via dating applications to capture your user credentials so that when you try to log in to a site of their choosing, your credentials are disclosed to the attackers without your knowledge. Then, the attacker can reach out to your contacts, pretend to be you and send them phishing messages with malicious code that could potentially infect their devices. What Can You Do to Protect Yourself Against These Exploits? One of the primary challenges with dating apps is that they operate in a different fashion than other social media sites. Most social media sites encourage you to connect with people you already know. By definition, mobile dating applications encourage you to connect with people you don’t already know. So, what can you do to protect yourself? Trust Your Instinct: As the old saying goes, “There are plenty of fish in the sea.” If people you’re engaging with online refuse to provide the same basic information they ask of you; if their photos and profile appear too good to be true; or if their profile information doesn’t seem to align with the type of person with whom you’re communicating, trust your instinct and move on. Until you get to know the person well, resist any efforts to meet him or her anywhere but in a public location with plenty of people around.

Until you get to know the person well, resist any efforts to meet him or her anywhere but in a public location with plenty of people around. Keep Your Profile Lean: Don’t divulge too much personal information on these sites. Information such as where you work, your birthday or links to your other social media profiles should be shared only when you’re comfortable with someone. Don’t divulge too much personal information on these sites. Information such as where you work, your birthday or links to your other social media profiles should be shared only when you’re comfortable with someone. Schedule a Routine “Permission Review:” On a routine basis, you should review your device settings to confirm your security settings haven’t been altered. For example, I once had my cell phone revert to “GPS-enabled” when I upgraded the software on my device, permitting another user to identify my precise geographical location via a chat application. Prior to the upgrade, GPS device-tracking had not been enabled. Thus, you need to be vigilant, because updating your applications can inadvertently reset permissions for device features associated with your address book or GPS data. You should be particularly vigilant after any software upgrade or updates are made. On a routine basis, you should review your device settings to confirm your security settings haven’t been altered.

Use Unique Passwords for All Your Online Accounts: Be sure to use unique passwords for every online account you manage. If you use the same password for all your accounts, it can leave you open to multiple attacks should an individual account be compromised. Remember to always use different passwords for your email and chat accounts than for your social media profiles, as well. Be sure to use unique passwords for every online account you manage.

In addition to encouraging employees to follow safe online practices, organizations need to protect themselves from vulnerable dating apps that are active inside their infrastructure. As referred to earlier, IBM found nearly 50 organizations sampled for this research had at least one popular dating app installed on either corporate-owned devices or bring-your-own devices (BYOD). To protect this sensitive data, organizations should consider the following mobile security activities: Protect BYOD Devices: Leverage enterprise mobility management capabilities to enable employees to use their own devices to access the sites while maintaining organizational security. Leverage enterprise mobility management capabilities to enable employees to use their own devices to access the sites while maintaining organizational security. Permit Employees to Download From Authorized App Stores Only: Allow employees to download applications solely from authorized application stores, such as Google Play, the Apple App Store and your organization’s app store, if applicable. Allow employees to download applications solely from authorized application stores, such as Google Play, the Apple App Store and your organization’s app store, if applicable. Educate Employees About Application Security: Educate employees about the dangers of downloading third-party applications and the potential dangers that can result from weak device permissioning. Educate employees about the dangers of downloading third-party applications and the potential dangers that can result from weak device permissioning. Act Immediately When a Device Is Compromised: Set automated policies on smartphones and tablets that take immediate action if a device is found compromised or malicious apps are discovered. This approach protects your organization’s data while the issue is remediated. About This Research IBM Security analysts from IBM’s Application Security Research team used IBM Application Security on Cloud to analyze the top 41 dating apps available on Android devices to identify vulnerabilities that can leave users open to potential cyberattacks and threats. Those apps were also analyzed to determine the granted permissions, unveiling a host of excessive privileges. To understand enterprise adoption of these 41 dating apps, app data was analyzed from IBM MaaS360. In advance of releasing this research to the public, IBM Security disclosed all affected app vendors identified with the research.

IBM security researchers said 26 of 41 dating apps they analyzed on Google Inc's Android mobile platform had medium or high severity vulnerabilities, in a report published on Wednesday. IBM did not name the vulnerable apps but said it had alerted the app publishers to problems. Dating apps have become hugely popular in the past few years due to their instant messaging, photo and geolocation services. About 31 million Americans have used a dating site or app, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. IBM found employees used vulnerable dating apps in nearly 50 percent of the companies sampled for its research. Using the same phone for work and play, a phenomenon known as \\"bring your own device,\\" or BYOD, means users and their employers are both open to potential cyberattacks. \\"The trouble with BYOD is that, if not managed properly, the organizations might be leaking sensitive corporate data via employee-owned devices,\\" said the IBM report. IBM said the problem is that people on dating apps let their guard down and are not as sensitive to potential security problems as they might be on email or websites. If an app is compromised, hackers can take advantage of users waiting eagerly to hear back from a potential love interest by sending bogus \\"phishing\\" messages to glean sensitive information or install malware, IBM said. A phone's camera or microphone could be turned on remotely through a vulnerable app, which IBM warned could be used to eavesdrop on personal conversations or confidential business meetings. Vulnerable GPS data could also lead to stalking, and a user's billing information could be hacked to purchase things on other apps or websites. IBM said it had not so far seen a rash of security breaches due to dating apps as opposed to any other kind of social media. Meanwhile, it recommends that dating app users limit the personal information they divulge, use unique passwords on every online account, apply the latest software patches and keep track of what permissions each app has. IAC/InterActiveCorp, which owns some of the most popular dating apps, said its services were not at risk. \\"IBM tested IAC's dating apps - including Match, OkCupid, and Tinder - and they were not among the apps found to exhibit the cited vulnerabilities,\\" the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Tom Brown) ||||| February 11, 2015 11:25 PM NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Are you looking for love this Valentine’s Day? As CBS2’s Tracee Carrasco reported, there is a new warning that could leave dating app users heartbroken. “I went on just one Tinder date,” said Kelly Geiling. “I met a guy for drinks and that was it.” Many people are looking for love, and like Geiling, many turn to dating apps on their smartphones hoping to find it. “I went through to try and find, like, a normal person,” Geiling said. But now, daters need to worry about more than just finding a normal person. Hackers could be getting a hold of their personal information. “I’m concerned that I never thought about that,” Geiling said. According to new research from IBM Security, 60 percent of dating apps on mobile devices have security flaws that could allow a hacker to break in, install a virus on your phone — even steal a credit card or personal information. “Your contacts list; it could be your stored images, or your pictures. They can actually also potentially access features on the device – so your camera, your microphone, even your GPS location,” said Michael Monticello, security intelligence director of IBM Security Services. IBM Security found that 26 out of 41 dating apps that were tested put users at risk to hackers. The first step in protecting yourself is not to share too much information, and also, Monitcello said, “understanding if there is a configuration or how your app actually works is pretty important.” Also, you are advised always to make sure you use a trusted wi-fi connection. IBM Security doesn’t want to discourage people from using dating apps to find love, but just wants to make sure people are aware of these security risks. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"A recent IBM report has revealed potential vulnerabilities in mobile dating applications that could compromise their user's security.

Following the definitions of the logical operators, your job is to formulate a command that can be used to implement these instructions. Now let's use these guidelines to solve this problem. Worked Solution: Firstly, to get the rows where points are greater than 100, we use the 'filter_greater' operator, which returns the subview whose values under the header column (in this case \\"points record\\") is greater than the third argument (in this case 100). Here is how to define the operator: filter_greater{'points record', 100} This will return us the rows where the points record is greater than 100. Next, we need to count these rows. For that, we use the 'count' operator. The 'count' operator returns the number of rows in the view. The view, is the output of the 'filter_greater' operator. So, our final output would be count{filter_greater{'points record', 100}} This command tells the program to count the number of rows returned after filtering rows with points record greater than 100. It should return 6 according to the requirements. Output: count{filter_greater{'points record', 100}}."},{"question":"Sentence 1: we outgrew the need for that and so i used it for an aquarium Sentence 2: My fish love these improvements.

Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... answer the following question: What albums did the original lead guitarist for the band that had a member die in August 1992 perform lead vocals on?

How to reheat a roast Save the drippings from the roast when you first cook it. If you want to reheat a roast for later, the process starts when you first cook the roast. Roasts can dry out in the reheating process, so you'll want to save any fats or fluids that drip off the roast into the baking pan. Possible answers: A). You should also cook the roast slightly less done than you prefer. For example, if you prefer a medium rare roast, remove your roast from the oven when it's rare.; B). Fat and flavorings are usually stored in the oven to preserve the roast and keep the roast warm. You should deglaze the roast prior to reheating it, this will turn it into something slightly flavorless.; C). You should also save the drippings when you're reheating the roast. Plan on carrying these drippings with you when you're cooking it for storage purposes.; D). Check the coating that the roast has on the pan before you place it in the oven. While it can add a ton of heat later on, the coating will slow down the roasting process.;","response":"A). You should also cook the roast slightly less done than you prefer. For example, if you prefer a medium rare roast, remove your roast from the oven when it's rare. This is the correct answer because to prevent the roast from overcooking and drying out during reheating, you should initially cook it slightly less done than your preference. Now let's explain why the other answers are wrong: B) is wrong because storing fat and flavorings in the oven does not preserve the roast or keep it warm. Deglazing the roast prior to reheating also doesn't make sense, as deglazing is a technique used to add flavor, not remove it. C) is incorrect because you saved the drippings when you first cooked the roast, not when you reheat it. You don't need to carry the drippings with you for storage purposes, they should be stored properly in a container until needed for reheating. D) is wrong because the coating on the pan does not affect the reheat process. The coating will not slow down the roasting process and is not relevant to reheating the roast."},{"question":"Article: Consumers who have been impacted by the March 1, 2018 announcement will be notified by U.S. Postal mail.

For nearly two weeks, the company’s official Twitter account has been directing users to a fake lookalike website, the sole purpose of which is to expose Equifax’s reckless response to the breach. Advertisement After announcing the breach, Equifax directed its customers to equifaxsecurity2017.com, a website where they can enroll in identity theft protection services and find updates about how Equifax is handing the “cybersecurity incident.” But the decision to create “equifaxsecurity2017” in the first place was monumentally stupid.

Just 16 days removed from the 10,000-square-foot Texas governor's mansion, Perry is on the road and shaping the messages that will accompany a White House campaign. He stopped in Washingtonto deliver rhetorical red-meat to a friendly and very conservative audience. The early going has been kind to the Texan: While reporters can't let go of his calamitous 'Oops!' moment in 2011, he raised political eyebrows on Thursday by unveiling a list of 80 financial power brokers who will shake the trees and make rain for him. One of those financiers, who requested anonymity, told Daily Mail Online on Thursday – in advance of the governor's address to the conservative American Principles Project – that Perry is confident he can win. 'He and his wife believe they are touched by God, and that this is his time,' the donor said. 'It's like – they can't lose – that's the sense of it.' 'I don't know if he'll win the nomination, but I'm absolutely sure he'll be one of the last two Republicans standing,' he added during a phone interview. Perry got a warm reception in Washington on Thursday with themes that hammered President Barack Obama and pointed toward a second presidential run. PRESSING THE FLESH: Perry mingled in a room full of hundreds of right-wingers at an event hosted by the American Principles Project, which opposes abortion and gay marriage. Perry shunned reporters on Thursday night after his speech – Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal held a press conference after his lunchtime remarks – but his turn at the podium during the nighttime gala brimmed with that confidence – half campaign stemwinder, half inaugural address. He lifted a line from Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration, where the 41st president said, 'There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured with what is right with America.' Perry's version took aim at Barack Obama. 'There is nothing wrong in America today,' he said, 'that can't be fixed with a change in leadership.' That change is sure to come in January 2017, but it's anyone's guess who will move into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 'Our nation is on a slow glide-path to decline,' Perry said Thursday night. And Republicans see eight more years of a Democratic administration as a political doomsday. The GOP has a deep bench, with no fewer than 20 would-be nominees talking about running. They include governors, senators, former CEOs and diplomats, and a pediatric surgeon. Democrats, on the other hand, have Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. And few others judged as powerful enough or daring enough to challenge her. Knowing who will likely await them in America's political Super Bowl has allowed GOP White House hopefuls to keep their anti-Hillary powder dry and hold their best attacks until 2016 when they will matter most. Instead Perry and others are focusing their energy on Obama. The governor's speech on Thursday could have been the one he delivered on the stump in 2012 if his first presidential bid hadn't imploded when he couldn't remember which three federal cabinet agencies he had said he would close if he won the presidency. He hit Obama on foreign policy, on energy, on the economy and jobs, and on that distinctly Texas concern: illegal immigration. And he slapped Republicans, as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal had earlier in the day during an American Principles Project lunch, for risking the loss of their congressional majorities by straying too close to the political middle. THREE YEARS AND ONE 'OOPS' LATER: Perry was all smiles in October 2011 when he filed the paperwork for his name to appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot. CAMPAIGN MODE: The Texas governor wound up his crowd with reliable conservative themes and spent most of his time at the podium railnig against the Obama administration. READY TO RUN? Perry is road-testing themes for future speeches when the political stakes will be as high as any in American history. Americans, he said, rejected the Obama administration in November – citing 'the VA allowing our heroes to die, the IRS targeting citizens, the administration trading five terrorists for a military deserter, the rise of ISIS, the lies upon which Obamacare was passed, (and) the weakest economic recovery in history.' 'But let’s be clear about something,' he said in the Mayflower Hotel just a mile from the U.S. Capitol: 'The American voters’ rejection of the Democrats does not mean they embraced Republicans.' 'A congressional majority is a terrible thing to waste.' Similarly, Jindal had warned against the GOP slouching toward status as 'Democrat-lite.' Both men are rock-ribbed conservatives. Along with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, they will inhabit the right flank of the Republicans' march through next year's political playoffs. Perry spat out a litany of anti-Obama sentiments that could have come out of a tea party convention platform. 'Six years of study on the Keystone Pipeline, and still nothing happens,' he said. 'When Vladimir Putin was invading Ukraine, the president dithered when he could have sent a powerful message to the Russian president.' 'Our broken, outdated tax code has become an incubator of corruption, favoritism and bureaucratic harassment.' 'We need to stop strangling small businesses with over-regulation.' Perry, seldom soft-spoken, took special umbrage at Obama's plan to mainstream more than 5 million illegal immigrants with residency cards and work permits while hundreds of thousands more pour across the U.S.-Mexico border with drugs and human chattel. 'Those who smuggle children, enslave women, destroy lives by peddling illegal drugs and weapons, they are the face of evil,' Perry boomed. 'Texas has done more to secure the border than any state in the nation,' he exclaimed. 'And the message is clear: as long as Washington will not secure the border, Texas will.' 2016 STARTS NOW: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal spoke earlier in the day to the American Principles Project, the same group Perry appeared with at night. Perry was loose on Thursday night, free-wheeling his words as he boasted about his state's economic boom.. 'More people have moved to Texas than any other state,' he said. 'Lemme give you a little news-flash here – it's not because of our great weather in August.' At times he strayed near the eccentricities of an infamous October 2011 speech in New Hampshire that was so disengaged and free-spirited that political observers suspected he was drunk. Perry spent a week denying it, and was rescued from the biggest headlines only by businessman Herman Cain's sexual harassment scandal. The 'Oops' collapse came less than two weeks later. On that occasion, he said later, he was on painkillers for a back ailment. But Perry has never styled himself as a practiced orator or a charm school graduate. 'If you're looking for a slick politician, or a guy with great teleprompter skills, we already have that,' he said in one 2011 commercial. 'And he's destroying our economy.' 'I'm a doer, not a talker.' Write highlights for this article.","response":"Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas, criticized Barack Obama in a speech and hinted at a potential presidential run.

Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 06:31 EST, 29 January 2012. For those enjoying the unseasonably warm weather, the blast of freezing Arctic cold sweeping across Britain is in unwelcome reminder of what winter's normally like. But anyone with an eye for a stunning photograph is sure to welcome the dusting of snow which helps create a picturesque winter scene. The scene below was the view earlier today across Carr Shields in Northumberland, as a icy weather front swept south across the country from Siberia. Winter arrives: The unseasonably mild winter gave way to cold and snow which turned Carr Shields, Northumberland, pictured, into a picturesque snowy scene. Freezing: Weather forecasters saying the cold weather could last into February as homes in Allendale, Northumberland, stoke up their fires to keep warm. Forecasters expect temperatures are set to drop as low as -2C overnight. The. Department of Health issued a. 'Level 2' cold-weather alert running for the next two to three days,. which is triggered when low temperatures give rise to significant health. risks. It warned that low temperatures can especially be dangerous for the young and the elderly or those with chronic disease. Meanwhile, the Met Office put much of. Britain on a 'yellow alert' for people to 'be aware' of the adverse. weather conditions. It said: 'Icy stretches are expected to form on untreated surfaces, especially in places affected by showers. 'The. showers will fall as snow above about 250 metres, but there may be. temporary slush deposits to lower levels. The public should be aware of. possible travel disruption.' Forecasters say snow is likely to fall. on Monday across northern England, Wales and parts of the south-west. There will also be snow showers in East Anglia and the south-east on. Tuesday. Dan Williams, of the Met Office,. said: ‘This is certainly the longest run of colder weather we will have. seen so far this winter. 'There’s. cold air pushing in from the east, and it’s looking very wintry over. the next few days and might last for the first half of February.’ The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Snow fun: Youngster Amy Eager, five, has fun on a sledge in Bowes, County Durham, as heavy snow arrives in Britain this weekend. Cold snap: A cyclist braves the cold on the Pennine hill tops near Skipton, in the Yorkshire Dales. Chill: A man walks his dog through the snow at Kilhope, County Durham, as the country braced itself for a spell of cooler weather that has brought snow to some regions. Britain has seen very little wintry weather so far this season – but nothing is ever straightforward with our weather. After three consecutive harsh winters we have reverted to what is seen as more typical winter weather. Perhaps this year we have felt cheated by above-average temperatures and just a few frosty mornings. Now the snowdrops have appeared in the garden it seems that spring is not too far away. Prior to the winter of 2008-09 there had been only one truly harsh winter in the previous 17 years – and that began late in the season. Cold winds first reached us from Siberia in thefinal week of January 1995, leading to heavy snow showers. So could there be a sting in the tail this year?History says it can happen, even after one of the mildest winters on record. As recently as last Wednesday the temperature peaked at 12.1C at Hawarden in Flintshire, but a band of heavy rain sweeping into the North Sea by Thursday brought cold winds and snow showers to higher ground. The prospects for the coming week are for the coldest weather so far, with hard frosts overnight, snow flurries and perhaps just the higher ground seeing any heavy snow. Latest forecasts say tonight will. remain mainly dry overnight, with light winds and clear spells allowing a. widespread frost and some patches of freezing fog to form. Far northern. and western areas will be cloudier and a little milder however, with. spells of mostly light rain. Sunday is expected to be cloudy with. some rain in western parts, with snow over hills in Wales and. southwestern England later. Otherwise mainly fine after any fog clears,. although showery in the far east. On Monday a slow-moving band of rain. with hill snow in western parts will continue on Monday, before cold,. and bright conditions with isolated showers push westwards towards. midweek. Over the next couple of weeks, the. weather is forecast to be mostly settled and cold leading up to the. first weekend, especially towards the southeast of England, with. widespread overnight frost and some wintry coastal showers towards the. east. However, northwestern parts will soon. become cloudier, more unsettled, but milder with spells of rain and. some snow, the snow mainly on hills. Although there is considerable. uncertainty, the bright, cold conditions will probably continue for a. time into the second week in the east. The unsettled but milder conditions. in the west will probably spread erratically further east with time,. introducing spells of rain and some snow, again mainly on hills. This. progression may be coupled with strong winds and possibly gales in. northwestern parts. The cold spell breaks what has so far been one of the warmest winters on record. The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Forecasters said it was becoming. increasingly likely that the freezing temperatures would stick around. and even last through the whole of February. George. Goodfellow of the Met Office said: ‘It seems like we are edging toward a. scenario where lower temperatures last for the next four weeks. It is. going to be a contrast to the weather we have had this winter. Widespread frosts and snow could affect large areas.’ He said the wintry weather was a result of ‘a cold air mass moving across from Siberia’. There are fears that the sudden onset could bring travel chaos and catch many drivers off guard. AA. spokesman Luke Bodett said: ‘We have had a very mild winter so far and. motorists need to get into their winter mindset from today. It is going. to be important not to charge around in the way they may have been used. to and be prepared for the unexpected.’ The Met Office has briefed government. departments and local councils about the cold period so that extreme. weather plans can be put on standby.

Part #2: Identify if there is enough information in the Premise to support the claim made in the Hypothesis. Usage: In this example, the Premise states that \\"Carbon has four valence electrons.\\" The Hypothesis also says, \\"Carbon has four valence electrons.\\" Since the information in the Premise is the same as the Hypothesis, there is enough information to support the claim. Part #3: Determine if the Premise entails or agrees with the Hypothesis. Usage: In our example, the Premise and Hypothesis have the same information. Therefore, there is an agreement or entailment between the two statements. Part #4: Return 'entails' if the premise supports the hypothesis, else return 'neutral.' Usage: Since the Premise supports the Hypothesis in this example, the answer is 'entails.' This means that given the information in the Premise, the Hypothesis is found to be true.

Analyze the premise statement: \\"A nicely dressed woman standing outside waiting for a ride with a two-story bus in the background.\\" - The premise describes a woman who is nicely dressed and waiting for a ride. - There is a two-story bus in the background, but the statement does not explicitly say if the woman is waiting for that specific bus. 2. Analyze the hypothesis statement: \\"A woman is waiting for her bus while another bus headed for another location approaches her.\\" - The hypothesis suggests that the woman is waiting for her bus, implying that she has a specific bus in mind. - It also states there is another bus approaching that is going to a different location. 3. Compare the two statements to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise: - The premise does mention a woman waiting outside and a two-story bus in the background, but it does not provide information about the woman's intended bus or another bus approaching her. - The hypothesis adds new information that was not present in the premise, such as the woman waiting for her specific bus and the presence of another bus going to a different location. 4.

Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - John the Apostle ( Aramaic : Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew : Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek : ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament . - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD.

As part of a series of tests to ascertain Charly's suitability for the procedure, he is made to race Algernon, one of the laboratory mice. Algernon physically runs through a maze while Charly uses a pencil to trace his way through a diagram of the same maze. Charly is disappointed that he consistently loses the races. Nevertheless, he is given the experimental surgery. After the surgery, Charly is initially angered that he is not immediately smarter than he was before and still loses in races against Algernon. Eventually, however, he beats Algernon in a race and then his intelligence starts increasing rapidly. Alice continues to teach him, but he soon surpasses her. Charly's co-workers also try to tease him by making him work on a machine that they believe he will not be able to work. When Charly shows he can work the machine, his co-workers are not pleased with the fact that he is now intelligent and cannot be teased anymore. They sign a petition against him and he loses his job at the bakery. Charly also starts staring at Alice's bottom and breasts as well as drawing and painting abstract nude figures of her. He also questions whether Alice loves her fiancÃ©. One night, Charly follows Alice back to her apartment and sexually assaults her, pulling her to the floor and kissing her forcefully until she breaks free by slapping him. The film then uses a montage sequence to show Charly â having escaped into the counterculture â wearing a mustache and goatee, riding a...

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: big fat disappointment Review: After seeing this I really wonder why it was so overhyped in the first place. Instead of running around and selling himself as the new hope for horror films (the guys does four commentarys (!) on that friggin Dvd) Eli Roth should learn to write a decent scripts. At times this thing was so stupid it felt like it was written by some sixteen year old who's making a homemovie trying to copy his favorite horror films. Nothing in this film makes sense, the characters are despisable, everything they say or do is a sign for Roths horrible script. Implausibilties galore and no friggin supense at all. Just throwing buckets of blood around doesnt make a good horror film - Roth should go watch Evil Dead again, there's more to it then just the gore. Answer:","response":"Based on the review provided, it is evident that the customer is dissatisfied with the product. The title itself, \\"big fat disappointment,\\" highlights the customer's negative sentiment about the product. The reviewer elaborates on their dissatisfaction throughout the review, mentioning the overhyped nature of the product, and criticizes Eli Roth, the creator of the product, for needing to improve his writing skills for creating a better script. The reviewer highlights the perceived immaturity of the script, comparing it to something that might have been written by a sixteen-year-old, which is an indication of their dissatisfaction with the quality of the content. Furthermore, the customer addresses the lack of sense or logic in the movie, describing the characters as \\"despicable\\" and blaming Roth's \\"horrible script\\" for the characters' unlikable conduct. This highlights the customer's frustration with the lack of believability and plausibility within the film. The review also specifically points out the lack of suspense and tension, which are crucial elements for a successful horror film. The customer suggests that merely including a lot of gore does not make a movie a good horror film, and recommends Roth to watch the movie \\"Evil Dead\\" to better understand the balance between gore and effective storytelling. In conclusion, the customer is clearly dissatisfied with the product due to a variety of reasons, including the overhyped nature of the film, the poor writing, lack of suspense, and an excessive reliance on gore. The customer's disappointment in the product is evident in their disapproving tone and critical rhetoric throughout the review."},{"question":"How is \\"Integrated Services Group provides a range of outsourcing services to maximize customer activity and focus all his efforts on the core area of his business.\\" said in Russian?","response":"To translate the given sentence into Russian, I will break it down into individual words and phrases and translate each of them.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose pancake mix is not mixed with enough liquid happens, how will it affect the red giant is smaller. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"To address the perturbation hypothesis, we first need to clarify the context as there appears to be a mix of celestial objects (stars) and an unrelated analogy (pancake mix). Assuming that you are using the pancake mix as a metaphor to describe the star's composition and asking how the lack of proper mixing could affect the star's size and the process of it becoming a red giant, we can evaluate this relationship step-by-step. 1. A star burns in space: A star generates its energy primarily from nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms are fused together to form helium, releasing energy in the process. 2. Eventually, it burns all its hydrogen: As a star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it starts to cool and contract. 3. Becomes a red giant: When the core of a star contracts, the outer layers of the star expand and the star now appears much larger and cooler than before, thereby turning it into a red giant. Now, addressing the perturbation hypothesis: If the star's composition (analogous to the pancake mix) is not properly mixed and insufficient fusion-able material (liquid in the pancake analogy) is present, how does this affect the process? 4. Red giant is smaller: A star with less fusion-able material will have a smaller mass. Consequently, the mass of such a star might not be enough to turn it into a red giant, or it may become a smaller red giant depending on the mass deficiency. 5. Once the red giant burns itself out: The smaller red giant will still undergo helium fusion in its core, but with a lesser amount of material. 6. The core of the star collapses: With less fusion material, the core will collapse faster. 7. The gasses will start to disperse: As the core collapses, the outer layers of the red giant will be expelled, dispersing the gasses into space. 8. Only the core is left: The core that remains will have a smaller mass due to the lesser amount of original material. 9. A white dwarf has been formed: Finally, the remnant core will become a white dwarf, albeit with a smaller mass than a typical white dwarf formed from a more massive star. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation in the star's composition (less fusion-able material) will have a direct effect on the process, potentially creating a smaller red giant and a less massive white dwarf."},{"question":"Vekiller, seçimlerin Üsküp'ün AB ile üyelik müzakerelerine başlamaya yönelik hazırlıklarını aksatmaması yönündeki umutlarını dile getirdiler.

They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the speakers of Turkic languages. Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire. In addition, a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe. The ethnonym \\"Turk\\" may be first discerned in Herodotus' (c. 484–425 BC) reference to Targitas, first king of the Scythians; furthermore, during the first century AD., Pomponius Mela refers to the \\"Turcae\\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \\"Tyrcae\\" among the people of the same area. The first definite references to the \\"Turks\\" come mainly from Chinese sources in the sixth century. In these sources, \\"Turk\\" appears as \\"Tujue\\" (), which referred to the Göktürks. Although \\"Turk\\" refers to Turkish people, it may also sometimes refer to the wider language group of Turkic peoples. In the 19th century, the word \\"Türk\\" only referred to Anatolian villagers. The Ottoman ruling class identified themselves as Ottomans, not usually as Turks. In the late 19th century, as the Ottoman upper classes adopted European ideas of nationalism the term \\"Türk\\" took on a much more positive connotation.

Article: Magic is believed to have begun with the Egyptians, in 1700 BC. A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh, or the king. He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids. The \\"Cups and Balls\\" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today. The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic. Actually, one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests even built magic devices into their temples. These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues' mouths. This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful. Magic, however, was not well accepted before the 1800s. Magicians were thought of as freaks and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people's views and attitudes about magic. It was also because of Robert Houdin that many magicians were able to add Dr. or MD to their names. Today magicians try hard to find new ways to show their practiced skills. Magic is now entertainment for families all over the world. Question: Which of the following statements is true? Options: A: Magic began about 3,700 years ago.

Question: While attending the garden party, how is Holmes disguised? Movie plot title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The picture begins with Moriarty and Holmes verbally sparring on the steps outside the Old Bailey where Moriarty has just been acquitted on a charge of murder due to lack of evidence. Holmes remarks, \\"You've a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it, pickled in alcohol, to the London Medical Society\\". \\"It would make an impressive exhibit\\", replies Moriarty. Later Holmes and Watson are visited at 221B Baker Street by Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino). She tells him that her brother Lloyd has received a strange note - a drawing of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck - identical to one received by her father just before his brutal murder ten years before. Holmes deduces that the note is a warning and rushes to find Lloyd Brandon. However he is too late, as Lloyd has been murdered by being strangled and having his skull crushed. Holmes investigates and attends a garden party, disguised as a music-hall entertainer, where he correctly believes an attempt will be made on Ann's life. Hearing her cries from a nearby park he captures her assailant, who turns out to be Gabriel Mateo, out for revenge on the Brandons for the murder of his father by Ann's father in a dispute over ownership of their South American mine. His murder weapon was a bolas. Mateo also reveals that it was Moriarty who urged him to seek revenge. Holmes realises that Moriarty is using the case as a distraction from his real crime, a crime that will stir the British Empire - an attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. Holmes rushes to the Tower of London to prevent the crime, and during a struggle Moriarty falls, presumably to his death. In the end, Ann is married and Holmes tries to shoo a fly by playing his violin, only to have Watson swat it with his newspaper remarking, \\"Elementary, my dear Holmes, elementary.\\"[3] A:","response":"While attending the garden party, Holmes is disguised as a music-hall entertainer."},{"question":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 75*y = 82*y + 28 for y.","response":"To solve the equation 75*y = 82*y + 28 for y, we'll need to isolate y on one side of the equation. Let's follow the steps to find the solution: Step 1: Move the 'y' terms to one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 75*y from both sides to get all 'y' terms on the same side. 75*y - 75*y = 82*y - 75*y + 28 This simplifies to: 0 = 7*y + 28 Step 2: Isolate the y term. To solve for y, we need to get y by itself. We can do this by subtracting 28 from both sides of the equation. 7*y = -28 Step 3: Solve for y by dividing both sides by 7. Now, we simply divide by 7 to get y by itself. y = -28 / 7 This simplifies to: y = -4 So, the solution to the equation 75*y = 82*y + 28 is y = -4."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: The rapid development of technology has become a noteworthy characteristic of the 21st century, transforming various aspects of daily life, making communication and data-sharing easier than ever. In the healthcare industry, the integration of technology is believed to have enormous potential for improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and contributing to a more efficient healthcare system. One such technology playing a key role in this transformation is telemedicine. Telemedicine refers to the delivery of medical services and healthcare information through the use of telecommunication technologies, such as video conferencing, mobile applications, and remote monitoring. It is becoming a vital resource for patients and healthcare providers, as it allows physicians to diagnose, treat, and manage health conditions from a distance, bridging the gap for patients in remote or underserved areas. In addition to geographical benefits, telemedicine also offers cost-saving advantages by reducing the need for physical facility costs and unnecessary hospitalizations. Hypothesis: The integration of telemedicine technology will significantly improve patient outcomes, expand access to healthcare services in remote areas, and reduce overall healthcare costs, ultimately leading to a more efficient and accessible healthcare system. To test this hypothesis, a multi-faceted approach can be taken considering various aspects of telemedicine being applied in the healthcare system. The impact of telemedicine on patient outcomes can be assessed by comparing the health outcomes of patients who have received telemedicine services to those who have not, controlling for factors such as age, sex, race, and health condition. Access to healthcare services can be evaluated by examining healthcare utilization rates in remote and underserved areas before and after the implementation of telemedicine programs, as well as the number of patients utilizing these services. Lastly, changes in overall healthcare costs can be analyzed by comparing the cost of care per patient in telemedicine-enabled settings versus traditional care settings, including factors like hospitalization rates, costs of physical facilities, and administrative expenses. By conducting thorough research and collecting data to address each aspect of the hypothesis, it will be possible to determine the extent to which telemedicine is contributing to improvements in the healthcare system. The results may potentially confirm that telemedicine is indeed an important tool for enhancing patient outcomes, providing healthcare services to remote areas, and reducing healthcare costs."},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: The congressional spending bill blocks Washington, DC lawmakers from implementing marijuana legalization. D.C. marijuana activists' worst fears were realized on Tuesday night with the agreed upon language. Congress, under the district's Home Rule charter, is able to veto every law approved by either DC voters or government. \\"This House language sucks,\\" said Adam Eidinger, chair of the DC Cannabis Campaign. Article:","response":"Title: Congressional Spending Bill Stifles Marijuana Legalization Efforts in Washington, D.C. The recently approved congressional spending bill has effectively thwarted any attempts by Washington, D.C. lawmakers to legalize marijuana within the district. On Tuesday night, the language contained within the new legislation confirmed the concerns of local marijuana activists who have been working tirelessly to change the drug's legal status. Under the Home Rule charter granted to the District of Columbia, Congress has the unique authority to veto any law approved by either D.C. voters or their government. With the passage of the latest spending bill, this power has been exercised to halt any progress toward marijuana legalization in the nation's capital. Washington, D.C. marijuana activists, who had been fighting for the cause, expressed their dismay and frustration publicly. Adam Eidinger, the chair of the D.C. Cannabis Campaign, spoke out against the congressional decision, stating, \\"This House language sucks.\\" The inclusion of the anti-legalization language in the spending bill further highlights the disparity between the federal government's approach to marijuana regulations and that of the individual states. While a growing number of states have chosen to legalize marijuana for either medicinal or recreational purposes, the federal government's position remains unchanged and unsupportive of these movements. In the long term, this disparity puts legal marijuana users, business owners, and patients in a precarious situation. Ultimately, the congressional crackdown on marijuana legalization serves as a significant blow to the efforts of activists within the Washington, D.C., area. Despite achieving some level of support from local voters and lawmakers, the push for a change in marijuana's legal status has come to a standstill under Congress' firm grip. As frustrations continue to mount, advocates for marijuana legalization will likely have to regroup and reconsider their tactics if they hope to reinstate the conversation around drug policy reform in the nation's capital."},{"question":"a millionaire businessman 's extradition hearing ended without a ruling on whether he should be sent to poland for questioning in a murder case .

One such avenue is the implementation and use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in education. Over the years, many educational institutions have integrated AI into their systems for various applications, ranging from customized learning paths to virtual tutoring and grading assignments. Despite its revolutionary potential, the use of AI in the education sector has sparked a debate due its ethical implications, accessibility, and overall impact on learning and teaching. Proponents argue that AI can help personalize and enhance learning experiences, allowing students to learn at their own pace. However, critics express concerns about data privacy, possible misuse of AI, and the growing digital divide among students. Hypothesis: The integration of AI in education can act as a powerful tool to revolutionize learning and teaching methodologies, making education more personalized and accessible to all students. Nevertheless, the potential risks such as data privacy issues and emerging digital divide need to be sufficiently addressed in order to ensure an ethical and inclusive implementation of AI in education. Besides, stakeholders – including education professionals, students and parents – should collaborate to strike a balance between utilizing AI for its potential benefits and mitigating its potential drawbacks. This balance would not only leverage AI’s strengths, such as personalized learning and efficient administrative tasks, but also ensure trust and fairness in the education system.

Cicero, a prolific writer, was known for his works on philosophy, speeches, letters, and rhetorical treatises. Throughout his career, he advocated for the preservation and promotion of Roman tradition, culture, and education. One of his significant contributions was the introduction of Greek philosophy, history, and literature to the Roman world. It was within these works that he referred to Herodotus as the \\"Father of History.\\" Herodotus was born circa 484 BCE, in Halicarnassus, which was part of the Persian Empire (today's Bodrum, Turkey). He composed the Histories, a comprehensive account of the Greco-Persian Wars. In the process, Herodotus developed a revolutionary method, documenting events in a critical and systematic manner that relied on gathering and evaluating diverse sources, validating the information, and offering well-structured narratives. Herodotus's Histories are often considered the first work of \\"history\\" in the Western literary tradition. Before him, the recounting of events was primarily through oral poetry, epic tales, and myths. However, Herodotus sought to understand the causes of historical events, their consequences, and the motivations of the people involved. This approach resulted in establishing the principles of historiography that later inspired historians like Thucydides and Xenophon. Though it should be noted that Herodotus's work isn't without criticism. Historians such as Thucydides have questioned his reliance on oral accounts and unverified information, occasionally resulting in a mix of history and folklore within his work. Despite these criticisms, Herodotus remains an essential figure in the study of history due to his pioneering methodologies and storytelling skills. In summary, Cicero, the Roman orator, and philosopher, was the one who attributed the title of the \\"Father of History\\" to Herodotus. In doing so, he acknowledged the revolutionary methods and the importance of Herodotus's work, which laid the foundation for modern historical writing and inquiry."},{"question":"Information: - Cyprus , officially the Republic of Cyprus, is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean and the third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean.

To do that, we need to get rid of the -143 that's multiplying 'd'. Let's divide both sides by -143: d = -2574 / -143 When we divide two negative numbers, we get a positive result: d = 18 And there we have it! The answer is d = 18. Good job solving that together!"},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: passing from poetry to present days and driving on the motorway siena/florence, the first thing that catch the attention is the circle of walls that encloses an old muffled world. it is not so strange finding people dressed in medieval costumes, especially in may for the characteristic medieval festival.","response":"Passing from poetry to present days and driving on the motorway Siena/Florence, the first thing that catches the attention is the circle of walls that encloses an old muffled world.

Article: Saturday was my husband's birthday, but we spent most of the time in the car. We were driving to Phoenix for the weekend to celebrate his birthday and see the Warriors play the Suns. My husband is a lucky man. Not only has he lived to see another birthday, but he doesn't mind driving 200 miles to see an NBA basketball game. In the car, his cellphone kept ringing with birthday greetings from family and friends. He put them all on the speakerphone so he could drive with both hands and I could listen in even though it wasn't my birthday. Meanwhile, on the CD player, the Reverend AL Green began to singLove and Happiness. A little good music makes a bad road better. Four hours later, we checked into hotel, got dinner and sat out a rooftop feeling glad to be alive. We had a great weekend--we ate too much, slept too little and the Warriors, well, they lost. But still, it was worth the drive. On the way home, I started thinking about birthdays. In our family, we celebrate four in January, four in February, and all the others throughout the year. Mine is next week. I felt lucky, like my husband, I will get cards and calls and maybe a few videos. I don't need presents any more. When you've seen as many birthdays as I have seen, the only gift you truly want is to see one more. Birthdays are the mile markers on the road of life.

I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing.

Not just because it was ten years ago, but also because it's such a great story to share. Why? I think the main reason is that admitting mistakes makes you easier to relate to. Interestingly enough, science confirms _ . Researchers have conducted many studies and have concluded that when someone makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way, they are found to be more likeable. In other words, if you're able to do well and then you mess up, it shows your human side. This allows others to connect and relate to you, which in turn makes them like you more. Growing up, I was type of student who had to get straight A's and the type of athlete who always had to perform at the top of the game. The problem was that my standards were so ridiculously high that I was never happy. It was only when I learned to let go and forgive myself for my mistakes that I truly felt relaxed. When one of your close friends or family members makes a mistake, are you quick to forgive and forget? Sadly, many of us often express more sympathy for others than ourselves.

Yes or no, is the answer \\"it's okay to make mistakes\\"? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes. The author of this passage clearly intended to convey the message that \\"it's okay to make mistakes\\". The main point of their narrative is about embracing and learning from errors. Using their personal experience and pointing out scientific research, they emphasize on the fact that making mistakes makes us more relatable and likable to others. They extend on this idea by discussing how high personal standards can lead to unhappiness and how forgiving ourselves can be beneficial.

A:","response":"Title: Great Functionality with Minor Issues Review: I have had a positive experience, overall, with the com.google.android.gms app. It reliably offers a diverse range of services and features, adding a great deal of functionality to my device. From location services to notifications and game enhancements, this app has been essential for enhancing my Android experience. The user interface design is clean and intuitive, making it easy for me to navigate through its various features. The app's location services are particularly impressive, as they ensure accurate real-time tracking for maps and other GPS-dependent applications. As a result, I've rarely experienced issues with map directions or location-based recommendations. However, there are a few smaller issues that prevent me from rating this app a full 5-stars. Firstly, I've noticed the app's battery consumption tends to be quite high, particularly when continually utilizing location services. This has, at times, forced me to limit my use of certain features in order to preserve my phone's battery life. Additionally, while app updates do bring new features and enhancements, I have experienced a number of cases where an update led to some temporary bugs or stability issues. Overall, I can genuinely recommend the com.google.android.gms app despite some minor issues. The features and usefulness far outweigh the occasional hiccups. If possible, future updates could focus on optimizing battery usage and ensuring thorough testing to minimize bugs and performance problems. With these improvements, I have no doubt this app would be deserving of a 5-star rating."},{"question":"Available options: [1]. Yes. [2].

That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy. Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines. In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books. Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources. Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market. The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades. Since 1990 a law and five relevant regulations were adopted in 1990 to govern the sectors. Since it started in 1993, digital publishing has _ . Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006. More than 500,000 kinds of digital books were produced last year alone in China, which is more than any other country in the world.

The thief was able to be sneaky in the boots, but not in the sandals, because the OPTIONS: [a]. sandals were made of superior material.. [b]. boots were made of superior material..","response":"The thief was able to be sneaky in the boots, but not in the sandals, because the boots were made of superior material. This choice of footwear made all the difference in the success of his various heists and schemes, as it allowed him to navigate quietly and efficiently through different environments without drawing any attention to himself. The boots that the thief chose not only had the advantage of being made of superior material, but they were also tailored to his specific needs. Made with fine and supple leather, they perfectly molded to his feet, allowing him to move comfortably and without any restrictions. The leather, being of high-quality, also helped muffle the sound of his footsteps as it cushioned the impact of his stride on the ground. The soles of the boots were another key feature, designed with a flexible yet robust rubber material that provided excellent traction and grip, enabling the thief to swiftly scale walls and traverse slippery surfaces with ease. Furthermore, the boots were crafted with impeccable precision and attention to detail, ensuring not only a perfect fit but also a sleek and inconspicuous appearance. The color of the boots was carefully chosen to blend in seamlessly with the shadowy corners and alleyways that the thief often found himself navigating. With every step, the boots seemed to meld into the darkness, leaving no trace of the thief's presence behind. On the other hand, the sandals could not provide the same level of stealth and dexterity that the boots did. While they might have been made from a sturdy and high-quality material, such as a reinforced canvas or durable rubber, the inherent design of the sandals left much to be desired when it came to sneaking around unnoticed. Sandals, by nature, exposed the wearer's feet, making them more susceptible to injury or discomfort when traversing rough terrain or encountering sharp objects. Additionally, the construction of the sandals, with open gaps between the straps, created numerous opportunities for unexpected and unwelcome noise. The straps themselves, no matter how well-made, could rub against the wearer's foot, producing an audible sound that, in the thief's world, could mean the difference between a successful heist and being caught red-handed. Moreover, the general lack of padding or cushioning in the soles of most sandals meant that the thief's footsteps would likely be more pronounced when moving about on various surfaces. In the end, it was the boots, with their superior material and thoughtful design, that proved to be the ideal footwear choice for the thief. He knew that without them, his ability to effectively execute his clandestine operations would be significantly hindered or even impossible. The boots were a symbol of the thief's commitment to his craft, a reminder that even the smallest details can be the difference between success and failure in the world of thieves."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Since Austin has been asked by Quinn to describe the painting as part of his art history exam, it is quite reasonable to assume that Austin would want to carefully study the painting in order to be able to provide an accurate and detailed description. When studying the painting, Austin would likely focus on several aspects, such as: 1. Composition: Austin would observe how the painting is organized, including the arrangement and positioning of different elements and subjects within it. 2. Color: He would take note of the colors used in the painting, their range and intensity, and the overall color scheme. This could help in determining the mood and tone of the artwork. 3. Technique: Austin would want to determine and recognize the specific techniques used by the artist, such as brushwork, strokes, and texture. This could provide insights into the artist's skill and intention. 4. Theme: Identifying the theme of the painting would be essential in understanding the message or story conveyed by the artwork. Austin might look for symbolism, cultural references, or historical influences to help shed light on the theme and context. 5. Style and period: Recognizing the style and period of the artwork is crucial in art history, as it can help situate the painting within a broader cultural and historical context. Austin would want to familiarize himself with the key characteristics of the style and period, making it easier to connect the painting to other works and artists from that time. 6. Artist's intention: Lastly, Austin might try to comprehend the artist's intention in creating the painting. This might involve studying the artist's background, previous works, and any available historical information related to the artwork.

Tip A involves weight lifting, but tip B does not involve weight lifting. Tip C involves running, but tip D does not involve running. Finally, tip E does not involve any exercise at all. David has to find out which tips are most useful for him. In which tip the skeletal muscle would not be bigger, tip A or tip B? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","response":"Based on the information provided, the skeletal muscle would not get bigger in tip B. Tip A involves weight lifting, which requires skeletal muscle contraction against a resisting force. This type of exercise increases the size and strength of skeletal muscles. In contrast, tip B does not involve weight lifting, so it is less likely to promote skeletal muscle growth compared to tip A. As mentioned in the hint, exercises like running mainly focus on increasing the strength and efficiency of the cardiac muscle, not necessarily the skeletal muscle. Since tip B does not involve weight lifting, it could be a type of exercise that focuses more on the cardiac muscle than skeletal muscle, or even an exercise that does not target muscle growth at all. Therefore, the skeletal muscle would not be bigger in tip B as compared to tip A."},{"question":"Answer the question below: If Mona is holding two pieces of fruit and she moves them farther away from each other, what happens to the gravitational force between the two fruits increase or decrease? Assuming that: The further objects are away from each other, the smaller the gravitational force. The answer to this question is:","response":"The answer to this question is that the gravitational force between the two pieces of fruit will decrease as Mona moves them farther away from each other. This is based on the assumption given that the further objects are away from each other, the smaller the gravitational force. This concept is derived from Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. In other words, as the distance between the two objects increases, the gravitational force between them decreases, and vice versa."},{"question":"Available choices: i.

By inaugurating what could be the first 1 billion campaign in history so early, Obama has gotten the jump on a scattered GOP field reluctant to take the plunge and hits the starting line months earlier than George W. Bush did for his 2004 reelection bid. Text Size - + reset VIDEO: Allen on Obama 2012 VIDEO: W.H. on 2012 POLITICO 44 The video – entitled “It Begins With Us” – is an effort to rekindle the grassroots fervor that propelled Obama into office and seemed to be a tacit acknowledgement that many of his supporters have been disappointed by the stuttering pace of change and the compromises Obama has made in the last two-and-half years. The two-minute clip features a series of interviews with voters from around the country explaining why they plan to support the president. It doesn’t include Obama’s voice or any new film footage of him. But it was quickly followed by an Obama email in which the president explained the early start to the campaign. “We’re doing this now because the politics we believe in does not start with expensive TV ads or extravaganzas, but with you — with people organizing block-by-block, talking to neighbors, co-workers, and friends,” Obama writes, explaining why the launch is coming more than 19 months before Election Day. “And that kind of campaign takes time to build.” Today’s announcement puts Obama well ahead of any potential Republican opponent in making his intentions clear. The lack of a clear GOP frontrunner so late in the cycle and the unwillingness of any potential opponent to commit is seen as a mixed blessing by Obama’s political brain trust. On one hand, Republican disunity is always a plus for a sitting Democrat. On the other hand, the lack of an opponent forces the president to have a conversation about himself with himself – denying him the chance to contrast his record with that of a living, breathing conservative foil. The launch also comes at middling moment of the Obama presidency. The economy is rebounding but still bad; Afghanistan and Iraq are winding down but Obama has accepted an ill-defined new mission in Libya; and the polls show him in the 42-to-48 percent approval range, basically where he’s been for most of his time in the White House. Yet both the video and email offer a clear preview of Obama’s 2012 strategy, a hybrid of let-me-finish-the-job optimism combined with a warning about what the country would look like in the hands of a Republican president. Nearly absent from Monday’s rhetoric is the “hope and change” theme that dominated Obama’s effort for four years ago – a recognition that the meme just wouldn’t float after his failure to deliver on some of his more high profile promises from 2008 such as closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, passing immigration reform, attacking global warming and ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan more quickly. And the video made a conspicuous bow to independent voters who are unhappy with what Obama has done. “I don’t agree with Obama on everything, but I respect him and I trust him,” a man identified only as Ed from North Carolina says in the video. Obama’s fundraising team has already had to answer a lot of tough questions in “listening” sessions around the country with top donors. And Obama himself tackles the issue of disaffection head-on in his statement. “We’ve always known that lasting change wouldn’t come quickly or easily. It never does,” he writes. “But as my administration and folks across the country fight to protect the progress we’ve made — and make more — we also need to begin mobilizing for 2012, long before the time comes for me to begin campaigning in earnest.” ||||| It's official: President Barack Obama will run for reelection in 2012. The president's intention to seek another term was announced in a video sent to supporters via email and text message on Monday. Over the weekend, multiple outlets reported that the launch of Obama's reelection campaign was imminent. By filing papers with the Federal Election Commission, the president can begin fundraising for his 2012 operation. In 2008, Obama secured a staggering 750 million in his bid for the White House. ABC News reports that some believe he \\"may cross the threshold and could become the first 1 billion presidential candidate\\" next year. Jim Messina will serve as campaign manager for Obama's reelection effort. He worked as deputy chief of staff to the president for two years until last January. Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post notes that many of the names who helped Obama win in 2008 will be on board to advance his second presidential campaign. The president's 2012 headquarters will be based at One Prudential Plaza in Chicago. The location sits just a few blocks away from where he gave his victory speech in 2008 at Grant Park. On Monday morning the Obama For America website greeted visitors, \\"This campaign is just kicking off. We're opening up offices, unpacking boxes, and starting a conversation with supporters like you to help shape our path to victory.\\" The site also includes a store with Obama-Biden stickers and apparel for sale. FULL EMAIL SENT BY OBAMA FOR AMERICA: |||||Summary:","response":"In 2012, President Barack Obama announced that he would be running for re-election. He shared this news with a video posted on his website and an email to his supporters. The video called \\"It Begins with Us\\" talked about how Obama's supporters wanted to help him win the election again. The email mentioned that they were starting the campaign early so they could connect with people all over the country. This announcement meant that President Obama was going to try and be president for another four years. He wanted to show people he was still working hard to make things better in America, like fixing the economy and making sure everyone can work. Obama also talked about how his campaign would not focus on things like ads and big events, but instead on talking to people from all around and getting their support."},{"question":"What claim can be made from the following pieces of evidence? 1.

States that are abusing their own citizens would shrug off criticism believing that European states will not back their criticism up with any action . .","response":"Based on the given pieces of evidence, the claim that can be made is that Europe needs to swiftly and firmly address human rights abuses within its neighboring countries in order to maintain its moral authority and effectively confront and prevent worse human rights violations across the globe. Evidence 1 suggests that Europe's lack of response to human rights abuses in neighboring countries weakens its moral authority to address such issues in other more distant regions. In order to maintain credibility and effectiveness in promoting global human rights protection, Europe must demonstrate its commitment to addressing and combating human rights abuses closer to home. Evidence 2 and 3 confirm the existence of human rights abuses within the Euro 2012 host cities, as well as in Ukraine. These examples demonstrate the severity of the human rights abuses taking place in European neighboring countries, which are affecting various marginalized and vulnerable groups. Evidence 4 emphasizes the necessity for European leaders to take human rights issues within their geographical region seriously and to act against such abuses, as their global influence on the matter depends on their ability to confront human rights abuses within their sphere of influence. Lastly, evidence 5 highlights the potential consequences of inaction. If European states fail to take a stand or pursue concrete actions against the perpetrating countries, states that are currently committing human rights abuses may dismiss Europe's criticism as hollow or hypocritical, harboring no real consequences or motivations for change. In conclusion, based on the provided evidence, the claim that should be made is that Europe must proactively address and combat human rights abuses within its neighboring countries to establish and maintain its moral authority, exert effective influence on the global stage in promoting human rights protection, and deter other states from disregarding human rights in the belief that Europe will not enforce its criticisms with meaningful actions."},{"question":"Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Honda has manufactured many sedans and SUVs.\\" Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"- Step 1: Analyze the sentence's grammar and structure. - Step 2: Examine the statement's subject and predicate. - Step 3: Check if the sentence contains a coherent thought or idea.

Don't expect it to amount to anything. It's likely a nonsense publicity stunt from a small-time conservative podcast host. On the face of it, the proposal is dumb. \\"We are losing our decency as a nation,\\" The Hill quotes lobbyist Jack Burkman as saying in a statement. Burkman says he was motivated by the University of Missouri's Michael Sam coming out prior to the NFL draft to create a bill that would keep the NFL from allowing gays to play. \\"Imagine your son being forced to shower with a gay man,\\" the statement read. \\"That’s a horrifying prospect for every mom in the country.\\" Especially those timid NFL players whose mothers keep a close eye on their mental health. Raw Story calls Burkman \\"powerful,\\" based in part on The Hill's assessment that he signed more new lobbying clients in 2013 than any other firm. In fact, the firm did less than 2 million in business in this Congress, through the first three quarters of 2013. And Burkman isn't just a lobbyist. He's also a heavy-hitter with 21 followers on Twitter, a \\"radio show\\" that appears to be nothing more than a podcast, and a pronounced issue with gay people. Here, from last February, Burkman criticizes the establishment media for forcing the Boy Scouts to accept gay people: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a son, if you have a son in the Boy Scouts, get him out now.\\" As of writing, the Boy Scouts of America has not collapsed in a moral panic. It's not clear how Congress would even enforce a ban on accepting gay players, which is one reason that policy experts, not lobbyist/podcast hosts, are generally the ones to draft legislation. The league receives some tax exemption, but that's a small stick for Congress to wave. Any attempt by the government to limit who private entities might hire would 1) probably lose in court and 2) seems somewhat contrary to the worldview of a conservative like Burkman. Burkman says he has political support for the measure, which is probably true. But he didn't indicate to The Hill any members of Congress who might want to carry a lobbyist's anti-gay NFL bill — perhaps because there are not many members of Congress who would be willing to do so. Update: Burkman told the Huffington Post's Sam Stein that he has five members of the House and a senator interested in co-sponsoring the bill. He didn't name any of them. Burkman's real goal is actually to get people to talk about Jack Burkman. He has succeeded, so now we can all go back to not knowing who he is. ||||| WASHINGTON -- A Republican lobbyist is preparing legislation that would ban gay athletes from playing in the National Football League, a move he says is necessary to prevent American society from sliding into indecency. Jack Burkman, the CEO of Burkman LLC, said Monday that he would push Republican lawmakers to support the measure, which he put together after college football star Michael Sam announced that he is gay. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Burkman insisted that five members of the House of Representatives and one senator are interested in co-sponsoring the bill, and that those numbers would rise to 36 and five, respectively, within three weeks. Notably, he declined to name any of the lawmakers in question. The absence of any actual details -- from the language of the bill to the names of potential supporters -- gave the announcement the unmistakable whiff of a publicity stunt. Burkman's own public relations firm broke the news of the legislation. Beyond his motive, however, is a larger question: Why would Burkman even bother? Sam's announcement was met with widespread support. Why should Congress create a conflict where, for the most part, one doesn't exist? Even Burkman concedes that conservatives like himself are supposed to find it abhorrent when the government tells a private business how to conduct its affairs. \\"However,\\" he added, \\"there are times when that is trumped for reason of great urgency or necessity. And I think this is it, because I see the society sliding in the wrong direction.\\" \\"I felt that if the NFL doesn't have any morals, and people like [Commissioner] Roger Goodell, who are just go-along-get-along guys, just want to appease advertisers, appease corporate America and all that stuff,\\" he said, \\"I figured, well, it is time for conservatives in Congress to step in and define morality for them.\\" But the slope is slippery and filled with intolerance. Burkman expressed particular concern about the possibility of a gay man disrupting the delicate equilibrium of a locker room. Does that extend to congressional locker rooms? Should openly gay politicians be prohibited from serving in Congress since, after all, lawmakers share gyms there? \\"That is up to Congress,\\" Burkman said. Would Burkman be fine with openly gay men playing in the NFL if they used separate bathrooms from straight players? \\"That would be a start,\\" he said. And what about the obvious historical parallel to the era when Major League Baseball prohibited black ballplayers from taking the field? \\"That is a completely different thing, a different issue. Race, skin color, have nothing to do with it,\\" Burkman said. \\"This is not about bigotry. It is about common decency and civility. Society is moving to a point where we are going to have unisex bathrooms and the next generation thinks that is OK.\\" Burkman's bill, if it's ever actually introduced, stands no chance of passage. Just imagine the laugh President Barack Obama would have if it somehow made its way to his desk. But the fact that he sees it as a potential fault line -- he floated the possibility of the bill being used by a Republican primary challenger to pluck off the incumbent -- suggests that GOP operatives anticipate some sort of a social conservative backlash and wouldn't mind profiting from it. Burkman isn't a no-name lobbyist. Though he appears on cable news less frequently these days than he used to, his firm had a big growth in clients this past year. He is also not necessarily the best person to wage a fight over decency and morality. A few years back, his name was reportedly found on the D.C. madam's list of clients of high-end prostitutes. \\"The story simply was false,\\" he said. \\"I'll say what I said on the air at the time. It is simply a false story. The numbers listed were never mine. It was planted by somebody in the liberal blog world.\\" \\"My life has been far from perfect. I am hardly any type of embodiment of moral perfection,\\" he added. \\"But I have never let that stop me from doing what I think is right for the nation.\\" For someone so fearful of a gay player entering an NFL locker room, one might be surprised by Burkman's claim that he has gay friends. He can't figure out how they will react to his new venture. \\"I think they would respect it,\\" he said. \\"I would hope that they would respect that a person is doing what he thinks is good public policy and doing what he thinks is right for the country.\\" ||||| Washington lobbyist Jack Burkman on Monday said he is preparing legislation that would ban gay athletes from joining the National Football League. Burkman in a statement said he has garnered political support for the bill, though his statement didn’t mention any specific lawmakers who are behind it. ADVERTISEMENT ”We are losing our decency as a nation,” Burkman said in a statement. \\"Imagine your son being forced to shower with a gay man. That’s a horrifying prospect for every mom in the country. What in the world has this nation come to?” Burkman said he came up with the idea after college football star Michael Sam publicly revealed he is gay a few weeks ago. If drafted, Sam would be the first openly gay player in the NFL. Jason Collins on Sunday became the first openly gay athlete to play for a major men's professional sports team when he suited up for the NBA's Brooklyn Nets against the Los Angeles Lakers. A number of Democratic lawmakers voiced their support of Sam after he revealed his sexual orientation in an interview with ESPN, and first lady Michelle Obama hailed him as an \\"inspiration.\\" Burkman was not available to speak with The Hill but urged Congress to act in his statement. “If the NFL has no morals and no values, then Congress must find values for it,” Burkman said. Burkman serves as founder and president of his own lobbying firm, Burkman Associates. He has also worked as of counsel at law firm Holland & Knight. In the 1990s, he served as counsel to then-Rep. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.). In a statement to The Hill Tuesday, Holland & Knight said it \\"is proud of its support of the LGBT community and we condemn Jack Burkman's current efforts. Mr. Burkman's employment with Holland & Knight ended almost 12 years ago. He was a lawyer in our Washington office from October 1998 to May 2002.\\" Burkman's firm, JM Burkman & Associates, signed 70 new clients last year, the most of any K Street firm, a recent review by The Hill found. The four-lobbyist firm specializes in helping companies secure contracts with the federal government. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"The news article reports that a prominent Washington lobbyist, Jack Burkman, is drafting a bill to ban gay players from the NFL, which he claims is to prevent American society from sliding into indecency. He alleges to have political support for the measure, but has not specified any members of Congress that would back it. The article suggests that this proposal is likely a publicity stunt, pointing out some inconsistencies in Burkman's stance, such as his conservative worldview being contrary to limiting who private entities might hire, and his lack of proper procedure in drafting legislation as a lobbyist rather than a policy expert. The article also highlights criticism concerning Burkman's credibility and character, with some suggesting ulterior motives behind his actions. Overall, the article strongly doubts the viability and sincerity of Burkman's proposed legislation."},{"question":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = The Waterman, food = Fast food, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes","response":"The Waterman is a place where people go to eat fast food, like burgers and fries, near the water (riverside).

Instead, he called his neighbors together , told them what had happened, and asked them to help pour dirt to bury the old mule in the well and put him out his misery. At the beginning, the old mule was crazy! But as the farmer and his neighbors continued shovelling and the dirt hit his back, _ . It suddenly dawned on him that every time a shovel load of dirt landed on his back, he would shake it off and step up!

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this goal, with several considerations and options along the way. 1. Define the intended use and desired features of the handles: The first step in making handles is to identify their purpose, as this will inform your choice of material, design, and any other functional features. Consider if the handles will be used for doors, cabinets, tools, or any other equipment, and whether they need to be robust, weather-resistant, ergonomic, or stylish. 2. Choose the right material: Handles can be made from various materials, including wood, metal, plastic, or ceramic. The choice of material will largely depend on the desired strength, durability, and appearance of the handles. For instance, if you want a strong and robust handle, opt for metals such as brass, stainless steel, or aluminum. If you prefer a more natural or rustic look, choose hardwoods like oak, maple, or walnut. 3. Determine the dimensions and design of the handles: Measure the size of the area where the handle will be installed, considering factors like grip and clearance. Then, sketch out potential designs. You may want to make a simple, functional handle, or one that's more decorative and ornate. You can also browse catalogs and websites for inspiration or use existing handles as templates. 4. Prepare the necessary tools and equipment: The tools you'll need will depend on the material and design you have chosen. Generally, you'll need measuring tools, a saw or cutting tool, files or sandpaper, a drill, and a vise or clamps to hold the workpiece securely. 5. Cut the material to size: Once you've finalized your design and measured the material, cut it to size using the appropriate tools. For wood, a saw or bandsaw may be used. For metals, use a hacksaw or metal-cutting bandsaw. If working with plastic, options include a table saw, CNC router, or 3D printer. 6. Shape and refine the handles: Shape the handles according to your design using files, sandpaper, or a grinder; this may involve carving, rounding, or polishing to create the desired appearance. If your design includes grooves or intricate patterns, a Dremel or other rotary tool can be helpful. Finish by smoothing the edges and corners to ensure a comfortable grip and prevent injury. 7. Drill holes for fasteners (if necessary): If your handles require mounting holes for screws or bolts, use a drill with the appropriate bits to create them. Ensure accurate hole alignment and spacing so that the handles fit well when installed. 8. Add any desired finishes: Depending on your chosen material and design, finishes may include staining or painting wooden handles, polishing metallic ones, or applying a protective varnish or clear coat to safeguard against wear and tear. 9. Assemble and install the handles: Secure the completed handles to their intended location using the appropriate fasteners (e.g., screws, bolts, or adhesive). Ensure that the handle is firmly attached and functions smoothly. 10. Perform regular maintenance: To prolong the life of the handles and ensure optimal performance, perform routine maintenance checks. This might include cleaning, tightening loose screws or bolts, and applying lubricant to moving parts if necessary. By following these steps, you can create custom handles tailored to your requirements and aesthetic preferences, ensuring a comfortable grip, durability, and a look that complements their surroundings."},{"question":"negotiators are trying to put more consumer benefits into the proposed merger of northeast utilities and consolidated edison inc. so the deal will look sweeter to connecticut regulators .

On receiving the news of a robbery in his territory, Kattabomman and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers. When the robbers are captured, they confess that they had been hired by the British to create unrest in Kattabomman's domain. They also tell him that the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain, Ettappan (V. K. Ramasamy), to help them in their endeavour to annexe Panchalankurichi. At Chayalkudi, a village near Panchalankurichi, lives Vellaiyammal (Padmini), who vows to marry the man who tames her pet bull.

Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"1. We need to determine how much more money Percy needs to save after receiving the 200 from his birthday and the 150 from Christmas. 2.

Percy will be selling his old PlayStation games for 7.50 each, so we'll need to divide the 150 remaining by the 7.50 price of each game to find out how many games he needs to sell. 5.

Consider what causes silent treatment. Article:","response":"Title: Overcoming Silent Treatment: Setting Boundaries and Nurturing Healthy Relationships Introduction Silent treatment is a form of emotional abuse that can cause long-lasting negative effects on individuals and relationships. Recognizing the cause and implementing strategies to address this behavior are essential to fostering healthier and more compassionate connections. In this article, we will discuss how to deal with abuse, set boundaries, end toxic relationships, and examine the underlying causes of silent treatment. 1. Recognizing and Dealing with Abuse It is crucial to acknowledge that silent treatment is a form of manipulation and emotional abuse. Abusers often use this tactic to assert control and degrade their victims, leaving them feeling helpless and isolated. To cope with this behavior, victims should learn to identify their abuser's tactics and develop strategies to resist the adverse effects. These strategies may include seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals, practicing assertiveness and self-compassion, and reflecting upon their own mental and emotional well-being. 2. Establishing Boundaries Healthy relationships require transparent communication, respect, and understanding. Establishing boundaries is a significant step in preserving one's self-esteem and mental health. Boundaries may involve setting limits on the type and frequency of communication, decision-making processes, and other aspects of daily life. Communicating these limits effectively and assertively is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the relationship and ensuring that both parties' needs are addressed. Additionally, having clear consequences for boundary violations can deter future instances of silent treatment and other manipulative behaviors. 3. Ending Toxic Relationships In some cases, despite our best efforts, it may become necessary to end a relationship that continues to be fraught with silent treatment and emotional abuse. Ending a toxic relationship can be challenging but is a necessary part of prioritizing individual well-being. Consider seeking guidance from friends, family members, or therapists to develop a plan for safely severing ties. It may also be helpful to engage in self-reflection and self-care practices to rebuild a healthy sense of self and prepare for future relationships. 4. Examining the Causes of Silent Treatment Understanding the root causes of silent treatment may provide helpful insight for both the victim and the abuser. Common factors that may contribute to this behavior include fear of confrontation, anxiety, feelings of powerlessness, and past traumas. By recognizing these underlying causes, individuals may be better equipped to address their own emotional responses and work towards healthier communication patterns. Conclusion Dealing with silent treatment effectively requires recognizing the abusive nature of this behavior, setting boundaries, and nurturing self-compassion. In some cases, ending toxic relationships may be necessary to protect oneself and move forward. Ultimately, healthy communication and understanding the underlying causes can pave the way for more compassionate and fulfilling connections."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Several types of gases form in the atmosphere - May come from different sources - The gases remain trapped in the atmosphere - Through the suns light the gases hold in heat and energy - Trap them in our atmosphere - The earth may become warmer this way.

Many medications can increase bowel movement frequency or cause diarrhea. Check the package insert that came with your medication. If diarrhea or any changes in bowel frequency are listed as possible side effects, consult your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms. Adderall has diarrhea listed as a side effect. Metformin, a common medication for diabetes, also cause significant diarrhea. Check with your doctor if you are having significant GI symptoms while on metformin. Other common medications can cause diarrhea, including misoprostol, laxatives, and stool softeners. Alcohol can also cause diarrhea and may exacerbate bowel-related medical conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Stress may contribute to increased bowel movement frequency and can cause diarrhea. People often feel anxious about relationships, finances, education exams, or other big life events. Avoid the stressors you are able to avoid. This can include changing your plans to avoid areas of high traffic, or avoiding a particularly difficult coworker. Treat your time as valuable. Learn to say no when someone asks you to help with a last-minute deadline or other activity that you really just don’t have time for. Communicate with respect. If your neighbor is running a basketball tournament out of their house and creating a traffic snarl in your neighborhood, politely ask the person to change their behavior. Perhaps they could encourage parents to carpool or park farther away. Be up front about how much time you can allocate to a project, conversation, or other activity. For example, if your coworker rushes up to you just as you’re about to leave for a meeting, politely tell them that you only have 5 minutes to listen. Forgive and move forward. Staying angry and holding a grudge takes energy – your energy. Talk with the person who has wronged you and honestly express your feelings. Know that their answer may or may not be what you want to hear. Sometimes shrugging your shoulders and moving on is the best thing you can do for you. Be adaptable and flexible. As important as it is to have a plan for many things, life always throws us curveballs. Ask yourself if having a pristine house is truly important, or if simply having a clean house is acceptable to you. Evaluate whether or not the thing that is bothering you will really matter a year or five years from now.

Sentence 2: Cult movies never sell more than a few thousand tickets. Options are: I. yes. II. it is not possible to tell. III. no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is option III: no. In the first sentence, it is mentioned that a basic story with great special effects and stupid dialogue can be very entertaining and that it is called a cult movie. Additionally, it states that no critic can impact the outcome of this movie being the highest-grossing movie ever. It sets the expectation that a cult movie can potentially be highly successful in terms of revenue. However, the second sentence states that cult movies never sell more than a few thousand tickets, which contradicts the possibility mentioned in the first sentence of a cult movie being the highest-grossing movie ever. If a cult movie could only sell a few thousand tickets, it would not achieve the title of being the highest-grossing movie.

Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989. Astley & Bedford Mosses, along with Risley Moss and Holcroft Moss, is also a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation, known as... contains an answer for the question: What are the major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of Lancashire Plain?, what is it ? The answer to this question is:","response":"The major habitats of the location that lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, specifically at Chat Moss, are lowland raised bogs. These bogs develop due to poor drainage, water-logging, and slow plant decomposition, which produces peat raised above the surrounding land.

Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \\"Amazing\\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction. - Hugo Gernsback (August 16, 1884 August 19, 1967), born Hugo Gernsbacher, was a Luxembourgish-American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine. His contributions to the genre as publisher were so significant that, along with the novelists H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes called \\"The Father of Science Fiction\\". In his honour, annual awards presented at the World Science Fiction Convention are named the \\"Hugos\\". - Lloyd Arthur Eshbach (June 20, 1910 October 29, 2003) was an American science fiction fan, publisher and writer, secular and religious publisher, and minister. - Experimenter Publishing was an American media company founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1915. The first magazine was \\"The Electrical Experimenter\\" (19131931) and the most notable magazines were \\"Radio News\\" (19191985) and \\"Amazing Stories\\" (19262005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones. - Edward Elmer Smith (also E. E. Smith, E. E. Smith, Ph.D., E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith, Doc Smith, \\"Skylark\\" Smith, orto his familyTed; May 2, 1890 August 31, 1965) was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and an early science-fiction author, best known for the \\"Lensman\\" and \\"Skylark\\" series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Skylark Three is a science fiction novel by author Edward E. Smith , Ph.D. , the second in his Skylark series . Originally serialized through the Amazing Stories magazine in 1930 , it was first collected in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press . - Fantasy Press was an American publishing house specialising in fantasy and science fiction titles. Established in 1946 by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach in Reading, Pennsylvania, it was most notable for publishing the works of authors such as Robert A. Heinlein and E. E. Smith. One of its more notable offerings was the Lensman series. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'skylark three' exhibits the relationship of 'author'.

Here is my justification: The process of making ice cubes essentially involves filling a tray with water and then cooling it to a point where water solidifies and turns into ice. Now, when the water surface solidifies in an ice tray, it directly impacts the 'freezing' step of our process. If the water surface solidifies before the water beneath it, it could potentially create a barrier that may slow down or even prevent the remaining water from freezing efficiently. As a result, you might end up with less full-formed ice cubes in the tray despite the same initial amount of water, because that solidified layer of ice on the top can prevent the water underneath from turning into ice properly.

Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa, made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King.

For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition. - A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality. - Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously.

One day they went to the zoo for an animal rights protest. And I was wondering Why did Riley do this? Choose from: *a bicyclist who has raced Riley *went to the zoo *a bicyclist who has raced Rile Answer:","response":"It seems there is some confusion in the question regarding the individuals mentioned (Sasha, Riley) and the actions they have taken. Based on the information provided, I'll try to clarify and provide a detailed answer. Sasha is an animal activist who went to the zoo for an animal rights protest. This action aligns with their role as an animal activist, concerned about the treatment and well-being of animals in captivity.

By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the human mind, it's important to take into account the vast complexity, unique experiences, and ever-changing thoughts and emotions that contribute to an individual's decision-making process. While it's true that certain general patterns and trends can often be identified in human behavior, the minute specifics and intricate reasons that dictate each and every action a person takes are influenced by a myriad of factors. These factors can include one's genetic predisposition, their personal history, culture, environmental factors, and exposure to new and transformative experiences or ideas. Additionally, it is vital to consider the influence of chance, probability, and unpredictability that remain inherent in the nature of human existence. The butterfly effect, for example, refers to the idea that seemingly insignificant and unrelated events can have far-reaching consequences that ultimately lead to major changes in a person's actions or decisions. Furthermore, the concept of free will should not be discounted when discussing the predictability of the human mind. Depending on one's philosophical stance, free will, or the ability to make a choice independent of external influences, might play a significant role in what an individual decides to do in any given situation. In this perspective, human behavior can never entirely be deduced or modeled based on past patterns, simply because it is fundamentally unpredictable. In conclusion, while it may be possible to draw conclusions about an individual's general behavior and even make some reasonably informed predictions, the inherent complexity, variability, and unpredictability of the human mind render it impossible to accurately and consistently predict the future actions of an individual based solely on their past decisions. Thus, the answer to the question, \\"Is it possible to accurately predict the future actions of a complex and unpredictable human mind based on their past behaviors and patterns?\\" is: it is not possible to tell."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Using this definition, the goal is to find the elements in the list A that are numbers. I would iterate through the elements of the list A and check if each element is a number or not. One way to do this is by using a conditional statement to determine whether the element is an integer or a floating-point number. Here's a step-by-step explanation for the solution: 1. Loop through the list A, for each element, element in A: 2. Check if the element is a number by trying to convert the element to a number using int() or float() function: - If the element can be converted into an integer or floating-point number without raising an exception, then it's a number. - If an exception is raised during the conversion step, the element is not a number. 3. If the element is a number, add the element to the solution list. 4. Continue iterating through the list until all elements have been checked. 5.

Considering that you have not specified a specific recipe or purpose, I will provide two reasonable methods: one for a cooked mixture and one for a raw mixture. Method 1: Cooked Pumpkin and Egg Mixture (Suitable for baked goods and dishes like pumpkin omelets) 1. Firstly, prepare the pumpkin by peeling and dicing it into small cubes. If you are using canned pumpkin puree, make sure to have it ready and measured. 2. In a mixing bowl, crack open the required number of eggs. Ensure that there are no eggshells in the bowl. 3. Whisk the eggs until the yolks and whites are well combined. 4. If you are using diced pumpkin, you may need to precook the pumpkin. You can do this by either boiling or steaming the diced pumpkin until it is tender. Alternatively, the pumpkin can be cooked in a skillet over medium heat with a small amount of oil or butter, stirring occasionally, until it is soft. 5. Once the pumpkin is cooked, fold it into the whisked eggs, making sure the mixture is evenly combined. 6. If working with pumpkin puree, you can simply add the puree directly to the whisked eggs, combining thoroughly. 7. If you're using this mixture in a recipe, such as a pumpkin omelet or a breakfast scramble, you can now cook the mixture per the recipe's instructions. Method 2: Raw Pumpkin and Egg Mixture (Suitable for recipes like pumpkin pancakes, waffles, and smoothies) 1. For this method, it is strongly recommended to use pumpkin puree, as it makes it easier to mix with raw eggs. If using fresh pumpkin, cut and remove the skin, and then blend the pumpkin to create a puree. 2. In a mixing bowl, crack open the required number of eggs. Ensure that there are no eggshells in the bowl. 3. Whisk the eggs until the yolks and whites are combined. 4. Add the pumpkin puree into the whisked eggs, making sure to measure out the necessary quantity your recipe requires. 5. Mix both ingredients thoroughly, ensuring a consistent and smooth mixture. 6. Your raw pumpkin and egg mixture is now ready to be used in the recipes of your choice, such as pumpkin pancakes, waffles, muffins, or even in smoothies. Both methods have their benefits and are suited to specific culinary purposes. Method 1 offers a cooked pumpkin and egg combination, which is ideal for incorporating into recipes like omelets or scrambles, whereas Method 2 provides a raw mixture of pumpkin and egg, making it perfect for use in recipes like pancakes, waffles, and smoothies. Choose the method that aligns best with your intended goal and kitchen needs for the best results."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

The match looked headed for a draw until Danish international Bendtner converted from close range to break the deadlock and Walcott rounded off the job in injury time. With Manchester City and Chelsea both winning, the three points was vital for the Gunners, who were top heading into the New Year and maintained a one-point advantage over City. They are also an unexpected 11 points clear of reigning champions Manchester United whose recent revival came to a shuddering halt with a 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the late kickoff. Tottenham, who recently replaced Andre Villas-Boas with Tim Sherwood, moved up to challenging sixth place with a third win in four games for the new manager. They took the lead just before half time through recalled Emmanuel Adebayor after a smart counter attack and added a second through Christian Eriksen in the 66th minute. Danny Welbeck pulled one back within a minute and Tottenham had to ride their luck in the last few minutes, but it added up to a fourth defeat at Old Trafford for United under David Moyes. Earlier, Cardiff, without a manager since the sacking of Malky Mackay, restricted leaders Arsenal to few opportunities despite their domination. Jack Wilshere was denied a penalty in the first half and then struck the base of the post after the break until Bendtner reacted quickly to score after Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall saved superbly from Bacary Sagna's header. Former Manchester United star Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a guest of Cardiff owner Vincent Tan at the match, increasing speculation he will take over from Mackay. Second-placed City picked up their seventh straight win in all competitions in the early kick off, beating Swansea City 3-2 at the Liberty Stadium. City's Brazilian defender Fernandinho opened their account after just 14 minutes following a Samir Nasri corner, which was not cleared by the home defense. Swansea leveled in first half injury time when Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony headed home, but the expensively assembled visitors stopped up the pace after the break and his international teammate Yaya Toure restored their lead with a deflected effort near the hour mark. City's Aleksandar Kolarov crashed home what proved to be the clinching third eight minutes later before the impressive Bony grabbed a late consolation in injury time from long range. \\"It was a very good result because Swansea are a strong team here at home and also away,\\" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports. \\"I think the way we won today is very important for us.\\" Jose Mourinho's Chelsea also kept up the pressure with a 3-0 win at Southampton, started by a header from Fernando Torres, who was a threat throughout, on the hour mark. Second half substitute Oscar set up Willian for a fine second just 11 minutes later and rounded off a superb performance with the third goal. It left Chelsea two points adrift in third spot. Fourth-placed Liverpool, still smarting from successive narrow losses to Manchester City and Chelsea, stayed in touch, four points adrift, by accounting for Hull City, winning 2-0 at home. Daniel Agger put them ahead with a 36th minute header with Luis Suarez netting his league leading 20th of the campaign with a fine free kick after the break. At the other end of the table, Fulham were indebted to Dimitar Berbatov for their winner in the 2-1 home victory over fellow strugglers West Ham. Nicolas Anelka, under investigation by the English FA for his controversial goal celebration in the draw at West Ham, played 88 minutes for West Bromwich Albion in their vital 1-0 home win over Newcastle. Sunderland remained rooted to the bottom as Gabriel Agbonlahor's 15th-minute goal gave Aston Villa a 1-0 win at the Stadium of Light, while third-bottom Crystal Palace were held to a 1-1 draw by Norwich City.

Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants’ recognition memory and their recall memory. Habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants’ recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants’ recall memory. Q: How can a researcher study a childs memory?","response":"A researcher can study a child's memory through various techniques and methodologies that are specifically designed to assess and evaluate the memory capacity of young children. Since infants and young children cannot provide verbal reports on their memories, researchers use alternative methods to understand their cognitive development. Some of the widely used techniques include: 1. Habituation: Habituation is a fundamental learning process through which infants show decreased attention and responsiveness to a stimulus that is repeatedly presented to them. Researchers can assess recognition memory in infants by observing how their attention and interest change when they are shown a familiar stimulus compared to a novel one. As the infant gets habituated to the familiar stimulus, they will display a greater interest in the novel stimulus, indicating their ability to recognize and remember previously encountered information. 2. Dishabituation: Dishabituation occurs when an infant's attention to a stimulus increases following the presentation of a new or changed stimulus. By observing the infant's reaction to the new stimulus, researchers can gather data on how well the infant can differentiate between familiar and novel stimuli, which provides insight into their memory capabilities. 3. Operant Conditioning: This method involves reinforcing specific behaviors in infants and young children through the use of rewards or punishments. By associating certain stimuli with positive or negative outcomes, researchers can evaluate a child's ability to learn and retain information about their environment. The infant's memory can be assessed by observing their ability to anticipate and respond to the associated stimuli based on their previous experiences. 4. Deferred Imitation: Deferred imitation is a method used to study recall memory in infants. In this technique, researchers present children with a specific action or sequence of actions on a toy or object, and after a delay (ranging from minutes to days), the child is given the same toy or object and encouraged to imitate the actions they observed earlier. Their ability to accurately reproduce the action or sequence demonstrates their capacity to recall and retain previously learned information. 5. Elicited Imitation: Similar to deferred imitation, elicited imitation involves presenting a child with a sequence of actions or events, but the child is encouraged to imitate the actions immediately after observing them. This method provides insight into the child's immediate memory recall and helps researchers understand their ability to process and remember new information. 6. Visual Paired Comparison: In this paradigm, infants are simultaneously shown two images or objects, one familiar and one novel. Researchers measure the time spent looking at each image to determine the infant's preference for the novel stimulus, which serves as an indicator of their recognition memory. By choosing and combining appropriate techniques according to the age and developmental stage of the child, researchers can systematically investigate various aspects of memory development in children. These methods allow for a better understanding of cognitive processes and memory capabilities in infants and young children, contributing to our knowledge of human cognitive development."},{"question":"Vivien Leigh (born Vivian Mary Hartley, and also known as Lady Olivier after 1947; 5 November 1913 - 8 July 1967) was an English stage and film actress. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her iconic performances as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of Tovarich (1963). After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley on 5 November 1913 in British India on the campus of St. Paul's School, Darjeeling. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (nee Yackjee; she also used her mother's maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in Scotland in 1882, while her mother, a devout Roman Catholic, was born in Darjeeling in 1888 and was of Irish descent. Gertrude's parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee (born 1840), a man of independent means, and Mary Teresa Robinson (born 1856), who was born to an Irish family killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in Kensington, London. In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore as an officer in the Indian Cavalry, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund. At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting \\"Little Bo Peep\\". Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) then situated in Roehampton, southwest London. One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become \\"a great actress\\". She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in Dinard, Biarritz, San Remo and Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended A Connecticut Yankee, one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. Vivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of \\"theatrical people\\", they married on 20 December 1932 and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman. On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, later Mrs. Robin Farrington. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How was that recieved by her parents?","response":"Vivien Leigh's desire to become an actress is not directly addressed in terms of her parents' reception in the provided information.

He previously was the 50th Governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017 and a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. Born and raised in Columbus, Indiana, Pence graduated from Hanover College and earned a law degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law before entering private practice. After losing two bids for a U.S. congressional seat in 1988 and 1990, he became a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. Michael Richard \\"Mike\\" Pence was born June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Nancy Jane (nee Cawley) and Edward Joseph Pence Jr. (1929-1988), who ran a group of gas stations. His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph. His family were Irish Catholic Democrats. Pence was named after his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from County Sligo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island, following an aunt and his brother James, and became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois. His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare. Pence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a BA degree in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a JD degree from the Indiana University's Robert H. McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis in 1986. While at Hanover, Pence joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he became the chapter president. After graduating from Hanover, Pence was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983. In his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat. He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and has stated that he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. While in college, Pence became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the great disappointment of his mother. His political views also started shifting to the right during this time in his life, something which Pence attributes to the \\"common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan\\" that he began to identify with. After graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice. He ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in 1988 and in 1990. In 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network. Pence left the Indiana Policy Review Foundation in 1993, a year after beginning to host The Mike Pence Show, a talk radio program based in WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana. Pence called himself \\"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\\" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as outspoken as Limbaugh. The show was syndicated by Network Indiana and aired weekdays 9 a.m. to noon (ET) on 18 stations throughout the state, including WIBC in Indianapolis. From 1995 to 1999, Pence also hosted a weekend political talk show from Indianapolis.

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting. The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president.

It often includes elaborate displays, songs, dances, and other behaviors meant to attract a suitable mate, strengthen the bond between two individuals, and establish a territory. Courtship rituals not only help birds find a mate with compatible genes but also play a crucial role in fostering communication and coordination between the mating pair, enhancing their chances of successfully raising offspring. During courtship and pair bonding, potential mates may present each other with nesting materials or food items, engage in preening or grooming behaviors, and perform synchronized physical or vocal displays. These rituals enable the birds to evaluate each other's fitness and suitability as a partner, ultimately contributing to the success of their future breeding efforts. In some species, pair bonds are formed for a single breeding season (seasonal monogamy), while in others, they may last for a lifetime (lifelong monogamy). Once a compatible mate has been found and a strong pair bond has been established, the breeding process begins. This includes the steps mentioned, such as the female laying eggs, incubation, hatching, growth, learning to fly, and ultimately, leaving the nest to begin their adult lives.

To provide you with more context, the Enewetak Atoll is part of the Marshall Islands, an extensive chain of more than 1,000 islands spread across approximately two million square kilometers in the Pacific Ocean. In the early 1900s, the Marshall Islands were part of the German New Guinea, a protectorate of the German Empire known as German Pacific colonies. During the First World War, the Japanese Empire sought to expand its influence and territories in the Pacific under the cover of the conflict. As the war started, Japan declared war on Germany and decided to occupy German territories in the Pacific. The Japanese government issued the \\"Japanese Plan for the Conquest of German Micronesia\\" and dispatched the South Seas Squadron, consisting of several cruisers and destroyers to invade the German Pacific colonies. On September 29, 1914, Japanese troops successfully landed on and occupied Enewetak Atoll, which was followed by the occupation of the Jaluit Atoll, the administrative center of the Marshall Islands, on September 30, 1914. The Japanese military quickly secured the rest of the Marshall Islands and German New Guinea without significant resistance from the German forces. As a result, the Japanese Empire expanded its territories in the Pacific Ocean. After the war, Japan was granted a mandate over the Marshall Islands by the League of Nations in 1920. This mandate gave Japan the authority to administer the islands, which also contributed to Japan's expansion in the region. However, Japan's control over the territory would only last until the end of the Second World War when the United States defeated Japan and assumed control over the Marshall Islands. In 1947, the Marshall Islands passed hands to the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and eventually gained full sovereignty in 1986 under the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In summary, the statement provided correctly identifies the date on which Japanese troops occupied the Enewetak Atoll, marking a significant event during World War I and contributing to the historical development of the Marshall Islands."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Also when I got ill with a fever, he was really kind and gave me medicine and got a priest to give me a _ in a Hindu temple we visited, and then I got well again very quickly. There were lots of amazing parts of the holiday. One was when we got to ride on elephants in Jaipur. My sister and I rode an elephant called Lucky. We were in a camel cart but Krishna talked to the camel's owner and we were allowed to ride on them, which was really cool. I also really liked the Taj Mahal because it was even prettier than I imagined. My sister lost her shoes. But the people in India are really kind, so we found them again. The weather was really hot which was nice because Krishna gave us lots of time to spend in the pool and relax in-between going to see all the amazing places. This was the best holiday that I have ever been on. I wish I could come back another year. Question: What does the passage mainly talk about? Options: A: A stupid tourist. B: A kind tour guide.

The vocals were taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991, the first time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was involved in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, \\"We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top.\\" On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: \\"Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung\\".In July 1991, Creation agreed to relocate the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records was unable to pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment. Dutt recalled, \\"I don't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out.\\" Shields' unpredictable behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect on Creation's finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later said he had been desperate to leave the project, while Creation's second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown. Green recalled, \\"It was two years into the album, and I phoned Shields up in tears. I was going 'You have to deliver me this record'.\\"Shields and Butcher became afflicted with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for further weeks while they recovered. Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows, which Shields dismissed as \\"Ill-informed hysteria.\\" Although Alan McGee was still positive about...

Here's a more detailed and longer explanation: Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that is essential for maintaining good health. It is widely known for its skin and hair benefits, but it also plays a crucial role in protecting and preserving the vibrancy of colored hair. When hair is exposed to various environmental factors such as heat, sunlight, and pollution, its color can fade and lose its shine. This is where vitamin E comes into play. As an antioxidant, vitamin E helps combat the harmful effects of free radicals, which are molecules that cause oxidative stress and damage to hair cells. By neutralizing these free radicals, vitamin E helps maintain the hair's natural color and prolong its life. This, in turn, helps your hair stay vibrant and healthy, even when subjected to coloring treatments or other harsh chemicals. In addition to prolonging the life of color, vitamin E provides numerous other benefits to hair and scalp health. It helps strengthen hair roots, promotes hair growth, prevents hair breakage, and keeps your scalp moisturized. This is due to its ability to improve blood circulation in the scalp, which in turn stimulates hair follicles and encourages hair growth. So how can you make the most of vitamin E's hair-preserving properties? There are several ways to incorporate this vital nutrient into your haircare routine: 1. Ensure you consume a balanced diet that includes vitamin E-rich foods like almonds, peanuts, avocado, sunflower seeds, spinach, and olive oil. 2. Use hair care products that contain vitamin E, such as shampoos, conditioners, and leave-in treatments specifically formulated for color-treated hair. 3. Apply a vitamin E oil or serum directly to your hair and scalp. Massage the oil into your hair, concentrating on the ends and middle sections where the most damage occurs. Leave it on for a few hours or even overnight before washing it off. 4. Take vitamin E supplements if advised by your doctor. However, always consult a healthcare professional before introducing any supplements into your daily routine. In conclusion, vitamin E is an essential nutrient for maintaining healthy and vibrant colored hair. By incorporating it into your diet and hair care routine, you can protect your hair from damage, improve its texture and appearance, and prolong the life of your chosen color. This will result in beautiful, strong, and radiant hair that will stay vibrant for an extended period."},{"question":"We are staying at the hilton and went down for breakfast.

Today it sits in a closet in Maryland. Cost to taxpayers for storing it: 1 million a year. And _ . Who knows what's in the rest of them? Because we think the government should be held to at least the same standards as a publicly traded company, and because as taxpayers, we're America's shareholders, we performed an audit of sorts of the federal books. We're not economists, but we do have common sense. We tried to get help from Congressional staffers from both parties, as well as various watchdog groups and agencies. In the end, we found that the federal government wastes nearly 1 trillion every year. That's roughly equal to the amount collected annually by the Internal Revenue Service in personal income taxes. Put another way, it's also equal to about one-third of the country's 2.9 trillion total annual budget. And reclaiming that lost trillion could help wipe out the country's annual budget deficit , improve education, and provide health insurance for those who don't have it. So how do you define \\"waste\\"?

I just wanted Will to know the truth.\\" said in Czech?","response":"To translate the given sentence, \\"What... - I'm sorry. I just wanted Will to know the truth.\\" into Czech, I will use straightforward language translation. This is mostly a one-to-one process but some factors such as language syntax, lexical differences, and socio-cultural elements may alter the translation process. The translation might not be perfectly word by word, since languages have different grammar rules and structures, and a faithful translation is often about conveying the meaning, not the exact words. Here are the steps I followed: 1. Identify the individual parts of the sentence. 2. Translate these parts into Czech. 3. Rearrange them to adhere to Czech syntax. Translating the individual parts results in: - \\"What...\\" translates to \\"Co...\\" - \\"I'm sorry.\\" translates to \\"Je mi líto.\\" - \\"I just wanted\\" translates to \\"Jen jsem chtěl/a\\". As Czech language distinctively use gender form in sentences, if a male is speaking it would be \\"Jen jsem chtěl\\" and if a female is speaking it would be \\"Jen jsem chtěla\\" - \\"Will to know the truth.\\" translates to \\"aby Will znal pravdu.\\" After considering Czech syntax, the full translation looks like this: \\"Co... - Je mi líto. Jen jsem chtěl/a Will aby znal pravdu.\\" Please note that getting a native speaker to proofread translated texts is always a good idea because translation often requires an understanding of context, culture, and the nuances of both the source and target language."},{"question":"Please briefly summarize this news article: 3 ways to save on wedding costs Venue: When picking a wedding location, the lowest rate does not necessarily mean it's the cheapest option. Ask what's included in the price. Essential things like chairs and tables may not be covered, said wedding planner Mayra Castillo of AaB Creates. Alcohol: If you're looking for the cheapest option, then say no to the open bar and just go with beer and wine. \\"A lot of people have this image of I want to toast with a champagne flute and have everyone wish me well,\\" Castillo said. \\"But with champagne, not every venue has that included and a lot of catering bills also sometimes don't have champagne included, so it's good for you to ask and make sure that that's what's included in your price per person.\\" Tax and gratuity: That's definitely something couples tend to forget about, Castillo said.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. If fewer people want to buy coal, there may be an increased demand for alternative energy sources, such as oil. This could lead to greater exploration and extraction of oil resources, which could affect the natural process of oil formation. As the demand for oil might increase, companies could invest more money in the exploration for new oil reserves or use more advanced techniques to extract oil from existing reserves. This could lead to increased drilling and extraction activities, which could potentially have environmental impacts, such as disrupting the natural process of organic material accumulating on the ocean floor or riverbeds and transforming into kerogen. Additionally, an increased demand for oil can lead to more research and technological development in methods to extract oil from unconventional sources like oil shale, which contains kerogen that can be converted into oil.

Mary asked Rebecca what the chemical symbol for nitrogen was because Possible answers: *Mary could not remember.. *Rebecca could not remember..","response":"Mary asked Rebecca what the chemical symbol for nitrogen was because she was studying for a chemistry test that was scheduled for the next day. In class, they had been learning about the different elements and their symbols, as well as the ways in which these elements interacted with one another in various chemical reactions. Despite having dedicated a considerable amount of time to studying, Mary found that there were still some areas where her memory was foggy. One area where Mary felt she needed some assistance was in remembering the chemical symbols for various elements. Although she could recall some of the more common ones like hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and carbon (C), she found that others were more difficult for her to remember. In particular, she was having trouble with the chemical symbol for nitrogen. Mary decided to ask her friend Rebecca for help because Rebecca was also in the same chemistry class and had always been known for her superior memory and ability to recall information quickly. She thought that Rebecca might have studied the chemical symbols in greater detail, and therefore might be able to easily help her with her query. When Mary posed the question to Rebecca, she hoped that Rebecca would be able to recall the information because of her strong memory skills. However, it turned out that Rebecca was also having difficulty remembering the chemical symbol for nitrogen. In fact, she was struggling with the same problem as Mary, and they soon realized that they were both unsure about this particular piece of information. Both girls decided that it would be beneficial to study together and consolidate their knowledge. As they sat down and went through their notes on the periodic table, they were able to determine that the chemical symbol for nitrogen was actually 'N'. This was a crucial piece of information that they needed to remember, given the importance of nitrogen in many chemical reactions and its significance within the environment, being a key element in Earth's atmosphere. The realization that they both had trouble remembering the same thing made them feel better about their situation. It was reassuring to know that they were not alone in their struggles and that other students were also grappling with the same concepts. As a result of their collaborative study session, Mary and Rebecca were better prepared for the upcoming chemistry test and were able to remember the chemical symbol for nitrogen, as well as many other important facts about the elements. In conclusion, even though Mary initially thought that Rebecca would know the answer right away, it became evident that both girls were having trouble remembering the chemical symbol for nitrogen. By working together and studying the material, they were ultimately able to determine that the symbol was 'N' and reinforce their understanding of chemistry. This collaborative approach not only built their knowledge but also strengthened their friendship, as they supported one another in their academic endeavors."},{"question":"Genuine MAPP gas can be used in combination with oxygen for heating, soldering, brazing and even welding due to its high flame temperature of 2925 ° C (5300 ° F) in oxygen.

Choices: - woodcutting - countryside - south america - earth - national park The rationale to choose \\"earth\\" as the answer is that: A:","response":"The depletion of forests is an issue that negatively affects the entire Earth for several reasons: 1. Forests play a vital role in the carbon cycle. They absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it as carbon, which is sequestered in the form of leaves, branches, and tree trunks. Deforestation reduces the capacity of forests to absorb carbon dioxide, leading to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming. 2. Depleted forests disrupt the water cycle. Trees release water vapor into the air through transpiration, which contributes to the precipitation process. When forests are cleared, it results in reduced precipitation and alters the regional water cycle, further impacting water availability for human populations and natural ecosystems. 3. Forests provide habitats for millions of species, making them biodiversity hotspots. Deforestation and depletion of forests lead to the destruction of these habitats and can result in mass extinction or endangerment of many species, ultimately disrupting the balance of ecosystems. 4. Forests act as natural buffers against natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion. By depleting the forests, we weaken the ability of ecosystems to perform these functions, leading to increased vulnerability to the negative impacts of such events. 5. The depletion of forests can also lead to economic losses. Many countries rely heavily on the forest industry for income, including through wood production and non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Depletion of these resources affects the economy and livelihoods of millions of people. 6. Depletion of forests can lead to the loss of many medicinal plants, which are a significant source of natural remedies and pharmaceutical research. This loss would limit future opportunities for discovering new medicines and treatments. 7. Forests have a cultural and spiritual significance. The loss of forests can result in the loss of cultural heritage, spiritual connection to nature, and traditional knowledge about sustainable forest management practices. 8. In the long run, deforestation and forest depletion can negatively affect climate patterns on Earth. Forests play a significant role in regional and global climate patterns, and their removal can contribute to unpredictable changes in weather, temperature, and precipitation. In conclusion, the depletion of forests everywhere has broad, transferable negative effects on the Earth's environmental, economic, and social systems. While other choices given—woodcutting, countryside, South America, and national parks—are also affected by forest depletion, the choice of \\"Earth\\" as the answer puts emphasis on the global and cascading impact of this critical problem. Protecting and conserving forests should be seen as an international priority for a better and sustainable future on this planet."},{"question":"Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This movie will always be a Broadway and Movie classic, as long as there are still people who sing, dance, and act.","response":"The sentiment of this review is positive.

And I marvelled more to see the two of us, both lovers of one lady and eager rivals, burying for the nonce our feuds, and with the same hope serving the same cause. We slept the night at Aird's store, and early the next morning found Ringan. A new Ringan indeed, as unlike the buccaneer I knew as he was unlike the Quaker. He was now the gentleman of Breadalbane, dressed for the part with all the care of an exquisite. He rode a noble roan, in his Spanish belt were stuck silver-hafted pistols, and a long sword swung at his side. When I presented Grey to him, he became at once the cavalier, as precise in his speech and polite in his deportment as any Whitehall courtier. They talked high and disposedly of genteel matters, and you would have thought that that red-haired pirate had lived his life among proud lords and high-heeled ladies. That is ever the way of the Highlander. He alters like a clear pool to every mood of the sky, so that the shallow observer might forget how deep the waters are.

While the Brandenburgian elector was free of Swedish vassalage in Greater Poland, he remained a Swedish vassal for the Duchy of Prussia. Brandenburgian garrisons then replaced the Swedish ones in Greater Poland, who went to reinforce Charles X Gustav's army. On 29 June however, Warsaw was stormed by John II Casimir, who had drawn up to Charles X Gustav with a force of 28,500 regulars and a noble levy of 18,000 to 20,000. Thereupon, Brandenburg actively participated in the war on the Swedish side, prompting John II Casimir Vasa to state that while his Tartars already had the Swedes for breakfast, he would now take Frederick William into custody, where neither sun nor moon would shine. Already in May 1656, Alexis of Russia had declared war on Sweden, taking advantage of Charles being bound in Poland, and Livonia, Estonia and Ingria secured only by a Livonian army of 2,200 infantry and 400 dragoons, Magnus de la Gardie's 7,000 men in Prussia, and 6,933 men dispersed in garrisons along the Eastern Baltic coast. Alexis invaded Livonia in July with 35,000 men and took Dünaburg. Answer this question: Which occurred first, the Treaty of Marienburg or Russia declaring war on Sweden?","response":"The Treaty of Marienburg occurred first. It was signed on 25th June 1656, while Alexis of Russia declared war on Sweden in May 1656."},{"question":"Premise: \\"They are not required to include in the audit documentation copies of documents they examined, nor are they required to list detailed information from those documents.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"They are not required to include source documents for the audit.\\"?","response":"If the premise is true, which states \\"They are not required to include in the audit documentation copies of documents they examined, nor are they required to list detailed information from those documents,\\" it entails several implications about the potential relationship between auditors and the documentation process for audit engagements. In order to assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"They are not required to include source documents for the audit,\\" it's essential to analyze the elements of the premise and understand the context in which it's being made. 1. \\"They are not required to include in the audit documentation copies of documents they examined\\": This statement implies that auditors, in conducting their audit work, do not have a mandatory requirement to include the exact replica of the documents they reviewed or acquired during the audit examination. The absence of this requirement means that the documentation process might place more emphasis on the auditors' assessments, findings, and conclusions based on their examination of source documents rather than the documents themselves. 2. \\"Nor are they required to list detailed information from those documents\\": This statement further stretches the idea that auditors are not obliged to offer granular details of the source documents they've reviewed. Consequently, audit documentation might prioritize capturing the essential findings and interpretations drawn by auditors from the source documents to evaluate the fairness and accuracy of an organization's financial statements. Taking these two statements into consideration, we can discuss whether or not the premise entails the hypothesis \\"They are not required to include source documents for the audit.\\" From the implications derived from the premise, it becomes clearer that auditors are not mandated to provide copies or listings of detailed information from the source documents they've examined. However, this does not necessarily mean that auditors are exempt from including any source documents at all. Audit documentation typically comprises various working papers, supporting evidence, and other records that demonstrate the auditors' understanding of an organization's overall financial status, internal control systems, and risk management practices. While the premise suggests that there might not be stringent requirements for the replication of source documents or extensive extraction of their detailed information, it does not explicitly negate the importance of source documents in the auditing process. In fact, source documents provide essential evidence for auditors to evaluate organizations' financial statements, and in some cases, specific source documents may be required depending on the auditing standards, industry regulations, or specific circumstances related to the organization being audited. Furthermore, the audit documentation might contain references to the relevant source documents to support the auditors' conclusions and assessments, even if they do not need to be physically attached or included as separate files. In conclusion, the premise \\"They are not required to include in the audit documentation copies of documents they examined, nor are they required to list detailed information from those documents\\" does not directly entail the hypothesis \\"They are not required to include source documents for the audit.\\" While the premise suggests some degree of flexibility in terms of documentation requirements for auditors, it does not eliminate the importance of source documents in the audit process. Instead, it may indicate a shift in focus towards the auditors' judgments, analysis, and conclusions, allowing them to provide a more targeted and efficient documentation of their findings that stem from the underlying source documents."},{"question":"What is a shorter version of this: palestinian leader yasser arafat called on the palestinians to get well prepared for the announcement of an independent palestinian state next may .","response":"Arafat urges Palestinians to prep for independent state in May.

She was raised in rural Kentucky and lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her widely known works include \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\", the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and \\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\", a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally. - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\". - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice. - In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - Phonaesthetics (from the \\"phn\\", \\"voice-sound\\"; and \\"aisthtik\\", \\"aesthetics\\") is the study of the inherent pleasantness (euphony) or unpleasantness (cacophony) of the sound of certain words, phrases, and sentences. - The PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction, formerly known as the Bellwether Prize for Fiction is a biennial award given by the PEN American Center and Barbara Kingsolver to a U.S. citizen for a previously unpublished work of fiction that address issues of social justice. The prize was established by noted author Barbara Kingsolver, and is funded by her. Winning authors receive a 25,000 award and a publishing contract, from which they receive royalties. - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - Marjorie Kowalski Cole ( July 20 , 1953 -- December 4 , 2009 ) was a writer of poetry , short stories and novels . She won the 2004 Bellwether Prize ( for previously unpublished works of fiction which address issues of social justice ) with her first novel Correcting the Landscape . - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages. - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - JUSTICE is a human rights and law reform organisation based in the United Kingdom. It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, the international human rights organisation of lawyers devoted to the legal protection of human rights worldwide. Consequently, members of JUSTICE are predominantly barristers and solicitors, judges, legal academics, and law students. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - PEN America Center (PEN), founded in 1922 and based in New York City, works to advance literature, to defend free expression, and to foster international literary fellowship. The Center has a membership of 3,300 writers, editors, and translators. PEN America Center is the largest of the 144 centers that belong to PEN International, the worldwide association of writers that defends those who are harassed, imprisoned and killed for their views. PEN America Center is one of two PEN centers located in the USA, the other is PEN Center USA in Los Angeles, it covers the USA west of the Mississippi. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'marjorie kowalski cole'?

She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement.

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.

The word itself derives through Old French from the Latin word \\"mansio\\" \\"dwelling\\", an abstract noun derived from the verb \\"manere\\" \\"to dwell\\". The English word \\"manse\\" originally defined a property large enough for the parish priest to maintain himself, but a mansion is no longer self-sustaining in this way (compare a Roman or medieval villa). 'Manor' comes from the same rootterritorial holdings granted to a lord who would \\"remain\\" therehence it is easy to see how the word 'Mansion' came to have its meaning. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - Landed gentry is a largely historical British social class consisting of land owners who could live entirely from rental income. It was distinct from, and socially \\"below\\", the aristocracy or peerage, although in fact some of the landed gentry were as wealthy as some peers. They often worked as administrators of their own lands, while others became public, political and armed forces figures. The decline of this privileged class largely stemmed from the 1870s agricultural depression.

The Welsh Lib Dems want to replace tuition fee subsidies of up to £5,190 a year with maintenance grants of £2,500. Ms Williams said the policy was more affordable than the current system. The Lib Dems' own review of their 2015 general election defeat cited the U-turn on tuition fees as one of the reasons for their collapse from 57 seats in 2010 to eight. Taking questions from an audience on the BBC's Ask the Leader programme, Ms Williams said: \\"I can't get away from the terrible mistake my party made in the coalition in Westminster. \\"We made a promise which we could not keep, and that let people down. \\"It didn't matter that Labour introduced fees, [and] they'd raised them. Plaid Cymru had raised them in the assembly. Our wrong did not make those wrongs right. \\"What we can do now is be very clear and upfront about what is affordable. \\"I could stand here and I could say that's fine, we can carry on paying these student fee grants for years and years when the reality is I can't make that promise. \\"I don't want to make the same mistakes as my colleagues. I do things differently in my party in Wales. I don't want to make those same mistakes. \\"That's why in this election we're offering a policy which we believe is affordable and which we believe is deliverable.\\" Asked if students would be £2,000 a year worse off under the Welsh Lib Dem plan, Ms Williams said: \\"Not upfront. \\"At the moment no student gets that financial support upfront. The support goes to an institution in England.\\" Welsh Labour has ruled out means testing for university tuition fee grants if the party remains in power after the election in May. The Welsh Conservatives would replace tuition subsidies with a scheme paying half the rent for students not living at home. Plaid Cymru would also scrap tuition fee subsidies and instead pay Welsh students working in Wales after graduation £6,000 a year, up to a maximum of £18,000. UKIP has said it would like to cut tuition fees, while the Greens have called for free university education across the UK. Summary:","response":"In a recent BBC TV election special, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams discussed the party's stance on tuition fees, describing the previous promise made by the party at Westminster as a \\"terrible mistake\\" that could not be kept. The Welsh Lib Dems now propose replacing tuition fee subsidies of up to £5,190 a year with maintenance grants of £2,500 for students, stating that this policy is more affordable than the current system. This change in policy comes in light of the party's general election defeat in 2015, where one of the reasons cited for their drop from 57 seats to eight was the U-turn on tuition fees. Regarding the new policy, Ms. Williams said it is crucial to be clear and upfront about what is affordable, avoiding making the same mistakes as the party's colleagues and offering a policy that is both affordable and deliverable. She emphasized that no student would be £2,000 a year worse off upfront, as the current support goes to institutions in England rather than directly to students. In comparison, Welsh Labour has decided against means testing for university tuition fee grants if the party stays in power after the upcoming election. The Welsh Conservatives propose to replace tuition subsidies with a scheme that pays half the rent for students living away from home. Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru plans to scrap tuition fee subsidies altogether and pay Welsh students working in Wales after graduation £6,000 a year, up to a total of £18,000.

A chef is a professional cook who is responsible for preparing and cooking dishes in a variety of settings, including restaurants, hotels, and cafes. In the context of a sushi restaurant, chefs may specialize in creating sushi rolls, sashimi, nigiri, and other traditional Japanese dishes with raw fish and other ingredients. These chefs are trained in the specific techniques and skills required for sushi preparation to ensure that the food is safe to consume and meets the high standards of quality expected in a sushi dining experience. From the given information, we know that the chef in question is currently at home and not at the restaurant. This suggests that the chef is not currently preparing food for patrons of the sushi restaurant. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the chef normally does prepare food for patrons of a sushi restaurant. It is important to consider various circumstances that could lead the chef to be at home rather than working at the sushi restaurant. Some possibilities include: 1. The chef has finished his working day and is now spending his free time at home. This would imply that the chef had been preparing food for patrons of the sushi restaurant earlier in the day and may do so again in the future. 2. The chef may be on a day off or on leave. In this case, while the chef is not preparing food for patrons of the sushi restaurant at this particular moment, they could still perform this task on a regular basis when they return to work. 3. The chef could be temporarily or permanently not working at the sushi restaurant for various reasons such as illness, personal issues, or a change in employment status. In this scenario, it's uncertain whether the chef still prepares food for patrons of the sushi restaurant. In conclusion, although it is true that chefs generally prepare food for patrons of sushi restaurants, it cannot be definitively inferred from the statement \\"The chef is home from work, sitting on his couch\\" that this particular chef prepares food for a sushi restaurant. We would need further information about this chef's occupation, work hours, and the circumstances of their absence from work to make a more accurate determination."},{"question":"There were four troopers.

Step 1: Understand the information given We are provided with the fact that there were four troopers. Step 2: Analyze the given statement The statement to be analyzed is \\"All of the troopers were named Jack.\\" Step 3: Check for relevance in the information provided There is no information about the names of the troopers provided, just the number of troopers. Step 4: Determine if the statement can be inferred Since there is no information about the names of the troopers, we cannot infer whether all of the troopers were named Jack or not. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (b). It is not possible to tell if all of the troopers were named Jack based on the given information."},{"question":"Given the question: Process: - The liver takes in blood from the rest of the body - The liver uses enzymes to clean the blood - The cleaned blood is expelled - The liver creates bile from the items filtered - The liver takes energy and stores it as glycogen - The bile is sent to the intestines. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person is very healthy happens, how will it affect the blood is more contaminated. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"To answer the question, let's first break down the given process step-by-step and analyze the possible effects of the perturbation hypothesis: 1. The liver takes in blood from the rest of the body: In a very healthy person, the blood entering the liver might be less contaminated. 2. The liver uses enzymes to clean the blood: Since the blood itself is less contaminated, it might require less effort from the enzymes to clean. This could potentially result in a more efficient cleaning process. 3. The cleaned blood is expelled: The cleaned blood, in this case, might be even cleaner than in an average person due to the better initial condition of the blood and potentially more efficient enzyme action. 4. The liver creates bile from the items filtered: The bile might still be created from the filtered elements, but there might be fewer contaminants in it due to the healthier blood. 5. The liver takes energy and stores it as glycogen: This process may remain unaffected, as energy storage is not directly related to the blood contamination level. 6. The bile is sent to the intestines: Since the bile contains fewer contaminants, it could potentially have a positive indirect impact on intestinal health. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of a very healthy person having more contaminated blood seems unlikely. In fact, a very healthy person is likely to have less contaminated blood, which could have a positive indirect effect on their liver and overall health."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Goggle play services I love it\\"","response":"Based on the positive sentiment expressed in the review \\"Goggle play services I love it\\", it can be inferred that the rating would likely be the highest ★★★★★."},{"question":"@cnnlngs actually monday the 4th.

The user seems to be anticipating his or her upcoming birthday on Monday the 4th. The phrase \\"going on 16 LOL\\" suggests a light, jovial tone in which the user jokingly claims to feel and act younger than his or her actual age of 34.

People usually look forward to their birthdays as it tends to be a time of gifts, parties, and other forms of celebration. In this case, the user does not explicitly express such excitement, but it can be implied from the context of the message as birthdays are typically viewed favorably. The humorous sentiment is emitted from the statement \\"going on 16\\" which implies that the user still feels young at heart and doesn't feel the weight of the age the user is turning. It suggests their youthful spirit and ability to laugh at themselves, which indicates a good sense of humor. It reflects a light-hearted perspective on aging, a freewheeling attitude which is typically associated with positive emotions. This tweet does not contain any negative sentiment or emotions such as sadness, anger, or fear. The user displays a positive outlook towards their upcoming birthday, and they are making a good-humored joke about their age.

The company, famous for making cellphones with physical keyboards that were once so popular people nicknamed them Crackberries, has decided to stop making its own devices. BlackBerry said on Wednesday that it will rely on partners to manufacture the phones, which will still have BlackBerry's look and feel. The company announced a joint venture with an Indonesian telecom company that will start making them. BlackBerry plans to turn its attention to software, a move it has made gradually in recent years as sales of its phones have slid. Shares of BlackBerry (BBRY) rose 4% in early trading after the announcement. But the stock price is well below its peak from several years ago. BlackBerry was once the phone of choice for Wall Street traders, politicians and celebrities, thanks in part to its well-regarded security system. President Obama was spotted with a BlackBerry. So was Kim Kardashian West. Related: Kim Kardashian's last BlackBerry Bold has finally died But the company was too late to the touchscreen game, and customers left in droves for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, Samsung's (SSNLF) Galaxy and other devices running on Google's (GOOGL) Android system. Even Microsoft (MSFT) has moved ahead of BlackBerry with its Windows Phones. CEO John Chen has tried to turn the company around since joining in 2013. But even as he has pushed BlackBerry toward mobile and security software, apps and the plethora of connected devices known as the Internet of Things, BlackBerry has bled red ink, posted sharp sales declines and lost customers. Chen has even done what was once unthinkable, opening the BlackBerry to other operating systems. The company now sells phones that run on Android. It also killed off its BlackBerry Classic line of phones this summer. So Chen deserves credit for stabilizing BlackBerry and refocusing it on higher growth areas. The company is also no longer in danger of going under, a legitimate concern investors had before he took control. BlackBerry now has about 2.5 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet -- money for a proverbial rainy day. BlackBerry will need all the cash it can get. The company also reported Wednesday that its latest quarterly sales fell about 30% from a year ago. And BlackBerry said that it expects to break even this fiscal year at best. That's still better than the loss analysts had forecast. But if Chen can't get the company's sales growing again and return it to profitability, there could be more pressure on him to sell BlackBerry. That's exactly what Chen has done in the past. He sold the struggling software company Sybase to SAP (SAP) for a hefty premium while he was CEO of Sybase. There has been chatter about a BlackBerry sale for years. The rumor mill may start turning again, though. BlackBerry also announced Wednesday that CFO James Yersh was stepping down and that he would be replaced by Steven Capelli, who worked with Chen at Sybase. Chen and Capelli also worked together at Pyramid Technology in the mid-1900s, a company that was sold to Siemens under their watch. So BlackBerry investors might be hoping that lightning will strike three times and Chen and Capelli can pull off another sale. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email It’s official. BlackBerry Ltd., the Canadian company that invented the smartphone and addicted legions of road warriors to the “CrackBerry,” has stopped making its iconic handsets. Finally conceding defeat in a battle lost long ago to Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., BlackBerry is handing over production of the phones to overseas partners and turning its full attention to the more profitable and growing software business. It’s the formalization of a move in the making since Chief Executive Officer John Chen took over nearly three years ago and outsourced some manufacturing to Foxconn Technology Group. Getting the money-losing smartphone business off BlackBerry’s books will also make it easier for the company to consistently hit profitability. John Chen Photographer: Pau Barrena/Bloomberg “This is the completion of their exit,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. “Chen is a software CEO historically. He’s getting back to what he knows best: higher margins and recurring revenue.” Chen should be able to execute his software strategy as long as he keeps costs in line and maintains cash on the balance sheet, Gillis said. BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, gained as much as 7.4 percent Wednesday, its biggest intraday jump since December. The shares were trading up 4 percent to C10.83 at 12:53 p.m. in Toronto. Licensing Agreement BlackBerry said it struck a licensing agreement with an Indonesian company to make and distribute branded devices. More deals are in the works with Chinese and Indian manufacturers. It will still design smartphone applications and an extra-secure version of Alphabet Inc.’s Android operating system. “I think the market has spoken and I’m just listening,” Chen said in a discussion with journalists. “You have to evolve to what your strength is and our strength is actually in the software and enterprise and security.” The new strategy will improve margins and could actually increase the number of BlackBerry-branded phones sold, Chen said, as manufacturers license the name that still holds considerable sway in emerging markets like Indonesia, South Africa and Nigeria. “This is the way for me to ensure the BlackBerry brand is still on a device,” Chen said. Although BlackBerry’s latest phone, the DTEK50, was already almost completely outsourced, the move is a big symbolic step for a company that once reached a market value of 80 billion. Today, it’s worth about 4.3 billion. Keyboard Fans Obama with his Blackberry in 2009. Photographer: Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images When the BlackBerry 850 was released in 1999, it married a functional keyboard with e-mail capability and essentially ushered in the modern smartphone era. With a proprietary operating system known for its watertight security, the phones became ubiquitous and extended the workday onto commuter trains and into restaurants and homes. They were an instant hit with business executives and heads of state alike. President Barack Obama was fiercely committed to his, but finally ditched it earlier this year, reportedly for a Samsung. In 2007, the iPhone debuted with its touchscreen interface and app store. People at first said they didn’t want to give up BlackBerry’s keyboard and simplicity. But the lure of apps eventually sent almost all its users to phones running Android or iOS. “It was inevitable at this point; they didn’t have the unit volumes to sustain the business profitably,” said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “This is doubling down on the efforts to focus on software which is really what their strength is.” BlackBerry shipped only 400,000 phones in its fiscal second quarter, half what it sold in the same period last year. Apple sold more than 40 million iPhones last quarter. Earnings Report BlackBerry said software and services revenue more than doubled in the quarter from a year earlier to 156 million. Still, software revenue was down from the previous quarter’s 266 million, which Chen blamed on patent licensing deals that didn’t carry over into the quarter. Adjusted earnings were at break-even, compared with analysts’ estimates for a loss of 5 cents. Revenue in the second quarter was 325 million, falling short of analysts’ projections for 390 million. For the full year, BlackBerry expects a loss of 5 cents or to hit break-even, compared with what it said was a current consensus of a 15-cent loss. While investors appear to be relieved that BlackBerry finally threw in the towel on handsets, Chen will still have to prove that he can continue to expand the software business in an increasingly competitive space. So far, Chen managed to hit his fiscal 2016 target of pulling in 500 million in annual software-only revenue last March. The next milestone is to grow that by another 30 percent by March 2017. Chen also aims to expand the margins of software products to around 75 percent from closer to 60 percent now, he said. Competitive Threats BlackBerry’s most important software is its device management suite, which helps companies keep track of their employees’ phones and make sure sensitive communication stays within the business. BlackBerry bought one of its key competitors, Good Technology, for 425 million last year, but the market is crowded. “This doesn’t change the fact that there are still a lot of competitive threats,” Kanterman said in a phone interview. VMWare, IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp. all have device management products and are taking market share by bundling them in with other business-focused software they sell. In some ways, it doesn’t make sense for BlackBerry to stay a public company. Given its shriveled market value, it could be the right price for a private-equity takeover, or it could sell out piecemeal to a bigger company like Dell Technologies’ VMWare or Samsung. To read a Bloomberg Gadfly commentary on BlackBerry’s future post-devices, click here: As BlackBerry reinvents itself, it will have to change how it’s perceived in the market. Investors still largely value BlackBerry as a hardware company, not the software provider it has become, Chen said. “As soon as that message is recognized, the stock will move to the right valuation,” he said. — With assistance by Elliott Snyder |||||Summary:","response":"BlackBerry has stopped making its own phones, and will instead rely on partners to manufacture its devices while it focuses on software, a move the company has been gradually making over the past few years as sales have dropped. CEO John Chen took control of BlackBerry in 2013, and has refocused the company on mobile and security software. Despite this, BlackBerry’s quarterly sales still fell about 30% from the previous year."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task you are given a tweet and you must identify whether the tweet contains any offense or any form of (untargeted) profanity.

Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas. Who wrote the Histoire naturelle des insectes?","response":"The Histoire naturelle des insectes, a work of natural history, was written by René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur. René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur was a prominent French scientist of the Age of Enlightenment, a period marked by the promotion and flourishing of intellectual and scientific ideas. His contribution to the scientific literature of this era, specifically in the field of natural history was significant, reflecting the increasing popularity and importance of such studies during this time. The Histoire naturelle des insectes, which focuses on the natural history of insects, is a notable example of de Réaumur’s work. In the exploration and documentation of this topic, de Réaumur contributed to the knowledge and understanding of the natural world, extending the reach of scientific inquiry to include the smaller, often overlooked inhabitants of the natural world - insects. Moreover, the increased importance and popularity of scientific literature such as de Réaumur's work during the Enlightenment illustrates the movement's emphasis on empirical observation and scientific method. As the article notes, fields covered by natural history became critical components of medicine, industry and education. The Histoire naturelle des insectes by de Réaumur is a testament to the scientific curiosity and spirit of the Enlightenment era, serving as an example of the scientific literature that characterized and fueled this powerful intellectual and cultural movement."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","response":"less effect Building more wind turbines will lead to an increase in the production of clean, renewable energy. As a result, there will be a reduced need for burning coal, which is a major source of sulfur emissions. With less coal being burned, there will be less sulfur combining with oxygen to form sulfur oxides. This in turn will lead to less sulfur trioxide being formed in the atmosphere.

Are the Catalan Sheepdog and the Can de Palleiro both bred in Spain? Answer:","response":"Yes, both the Catalan Sheepdog and the Can de Palleiro are dog breeds that originated in Spain. The Catalan Sheepdog, also known as the Gos d'Atura Català or Perro de Pastor Catalán, is a herding breed that comes from the Catalonia region in northeastern Spain. The breed has been used for various purposes, including herding, guarding, and even as a working dog in the Spanish Civil War. These dogs typically have medium-length, wavy coats that can come in various colors including white, black, gray, and combinations of these. The Can de Palleiro, on the other hand, is a lesser-known breed that originated from Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain. This breed has been primarily used as a livestock guardian and herding dog, protecting and managing flocks of sheep in the Galician countryside. The Can de Palleiro typically has a medium-to-long coat that is dense and slightly wavy. The coat may have varied colors from yellow, brindle, wolfish grey, or black.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. and the situation: Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go. Answer the following question: In which way Rob would not sink, sign A or sign B? Answer:","response":"To determine the safest route for Rob, it is important to consider the characteristics and mechanism of quicksand along with the information provided by both signs, A and B. Given that sign A indicates the presence of quicksand and sign B claims otherwise, Rob needs to analyze the situation carefully before making a decision. One approach Rob can take is to look for physical signs that indicate the presence of quicksand or stable ground. Quicksand appears to be solid, but the sudden application of pressure or a shock can make it behave like a fluid. He could observe the terrain closely, paying particular attention to the water content and general appearance of the area. As quicksand is generally found near water sources such as streams, riverbeds, or marshy areas, he should consider the proximity of water in each direction. He might also notice if there is vegetation in the area surrounding both signs, as quicksand generally has a scarcity of vegetation due to the unstable ground. Additionally, Rob could carefully test the ground near each sign to check its stability. He can use an object, such as a stick, to gently prod the soil to see if it gives way easily or retains its solidity. While testing the ground, he should avoid applying sudden pressure or shocks that could induce liquefaction. Testing the area around sign A and sign B will provide first-hand information about the soil's stability. After carefully performing these observations and tests, Rob should choose the path that presents the least likeliness of quicksand presence based on the gathered information. If sign A's route demonstrates characteristics consistent with quicksand, such as watery soil, lack of vegetation, and easily disturbed sediment, Rob's safest option would be to choose the path in the direction of sign B. However, if Rob finds no evidence that suggests the presence of quicksand, he can potentially take the route indicated by sign A. In this case, it is crucial for Rob to rely on his observations, intuition, and the quicksand indicators mentioned earlier to make the safest decision. In summary, Rob cannot blindly trust either sign A or sign B solely based on the messages they display. Instead, he must use his understanding of quicksand formation, observe the terrain, and test the stability of the ground before making an informed decision on which path to take. By doing so, Rob can minimize the risk of sinking in quicksand and safely continue his cross-country race."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Smith, up for her role in Mrs Biggs, and Duff, recognised for the second series of Accused, will go up against fellow Accused star Olivia Colman.

But Sylvester Stallone’s “The Expendables” - or “Eat Shoot Kill” - is stupid and sort of fun. It’s a macho, hard-rocking, a**-kicking action movie that is completely over-the-top and unbelievably violent, but without being mean-spirited or overly sadistic in the way Stallone’s action films have often been. In fact, it’s such dumb fun in a knuckle-dragging sort of way I think my friend the Incredible Hulk would like to say a few words about it. Go ahead Hulkie, the floor is yours. “Hulk like ‘Expendables.’ It SMASH. Guns go BANG-BANG. Things go BOOM. Fire EVERYWHERE. Cars crash and make even MORE FIRE. HA-HA-HA. Hulk no like Rourke, though. Rourke NUTS.” All right, Green Guy. That’s enough. In “The Expendables,” Stallone, who also co-wrote the screenplay, plays a character who calls himself Barney Ross, while the aforementioned Mickey Rourke, fresh from his bit as the Russian villain in “Iron Man 2,” plays the all-too-appropriately-named Tool, a character whose entrance is an homage to “Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man” (1991). Barney has so many tattoos he looks like he’s wearing a shirt when he isn’t. He has a cigar clamped permanently between his teeth, a ratty goatee and lots of guns. He’s also the seaplane-piloting head of a band of merry mercenaries. They are martial-arts whiz Lee Christmas (the terrific Jason Statham), chopsocky typhoon Ying Yang (the legendary Jet Li), big lug Toll Road (Ultimate Fighting champion Randy Couture) and machine-shotgun-toting smart-aleck Hale Caesar (the always welcome and in one scene hilarious Terry Crews). Also along for the ride is Barney’s old pal Gunner (Stallone’s former screen rival Dolph Lundgren, looking like a mile of bad road). These are the Expendables, a meaty amalgam of testosterone, hair dye, bad plastic surgery and firepower, and in an opening scene featuring dumb Somali pirates they blow a baddie in half. Their latest mission, should they choose to accept it, is to bring down the fascist government of the tiny South American island of Vilena and rescue a hot local girl from the bad guys. Chief among them is reptilian drug cartel head played by Eric Roberts, whose sister stars in the other big opener of the day “Eat Pray Love.” Dueling Roberts family values, anyone? Trailers for “The Expendables” feature the appearance of Bruce Willis and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are in the film for about 30 seconds. In another scene, Stallone gets past a customs agent by claiming to be an ornithologist In essence, “The Expendables” is John Irvin’s “The Dogs of War” (1980) meets Robert Aldrich’s “The Dirty Dozen” (1967), which is a good idea if you don’t have any ideas of your own. Plus, of course, Hulk likes “The Expendables.” Things go BOOM. Rated R. At AMC Loews Boston Common, Regal Fenway Stadium and suburban theaters.

Certainly not this one.A cartoonish symphony of muscles, bullets, tattoos and cigars, \\"The Expendables\\" is so determinedly old-school that its brisk action and bracing explosions take place not in the real world but on a mythical South American island named Vilena. If it does nothing else, it will make you nostalgic for a time when its more august actors, including Bruce Willis and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in tiny cameos, were at least age-appropriate for their roles.With its roster of action stars listed on posters like a high-powered team of urologists — \\"Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Austin, Crews and Rourke\\" — \\"The Expendables\\" is also a place where lines like \\"Friends don't let friends die alone\\" and \\"Don't talk to me, cockroach\\" can find a happy home.\\"The Expendables,\\" in case you couldn't guess, are not urologists but top-of-the-line mercenaries whose motto is \\"If the money's right, we don't care what the job is.\\" Barney Ross (Stallone) is first among equals, followed by Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang ( Jet Li ), Gunnar Jensen ( Dolph Lundgren ), Toll Road (mixed martial artist Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). Names, like the rest of the film, not to be taken seriously.The gang is introduced by co-writers Stallone and David Callaham in a flashback involving the expeditious rescue of a group of hostages from Somali pirates. The Expendables turn out to have a penchant for bickering with one another, however, and Jensen has to be let go for attempting to murder a prisoner. They have standards after all.Back home, the gang members find themselves restive in civilian life. Christmas, a whiz with a knife, is especially irked that his girlfriend Lacy ( Charisma Carpenter ), inexplicably peeved at his disappearing for months at a time with zero explanation, has taken up with someone who's an even bigger lout than he is.So no one is unhappy when, in a scene that for no clear reason involves Schwarzenegger as yet another mercenary named Trench Mauser, the team gets offered a new job by the shadowy Mr. Church (Willis).The job means going down to that fictitious island and taking on not only the evil general who runs it (David Zayas) but also his nefarious American enabler (Eric Roberts) and his brutal right-hand man, Paine (Steve Austin).Ineptly disguised as members of the Global Wildlife Conservancy, Barney and Lee go down on a recon and find the island too hot for them to handle. The only bright spot is their local contact, the sultry Sandra (Giselle Itie), a woman with an agenda of her own. When Barney is forced to abandon Sandra in a tight spot, he vows to return.For the Expendables would have you understand that they are not just behemoths with biceps as big as the Ritz; they have hearts and souls and, yes, tarnished ideals. Their attitude is expressed by Mickey Rourke as Tool, a tattoo artist and retired Expendable who smokes a long-stemmed pipe and bemoans a woman whose suicide he walked away from years ago in Bosnia. Friends may not let friends die alone, but bogus philosophizing is apparently business as usual. ||||| Breaking out A-team for B-movie actioner 'THE EXPENDABLES' | Even Stallone & Co. can't stop this bomb \\"The Expendables\\" is like no other movie I've seen this year. Other than \\"The Losers.\\" Click to enlarge image RELATED STORIES Slacker dude has mad skills, wild fantasy life For other movie reviews and more 'THE EXPENDABLES' Barney Ross: Sylvester Stallone Lee Christmas: Jason Statham Yin Yang: Jet Li Gunnar Jensen: Dolph Lundgren Tool: Mickey Rourke Paine: Steve Austin Hale Caesar: Terry Crews Toll Road: Randy Couture Millennium Films presents a film directed by Sylvester Stallone. Written by Dave Callaham and Stallone. Running time: 103 minutes. Rated R (for strong action and bloody violence throughout, and for some language). Opening today at local theaters. And \\"The A-Team.\\" All three of those films, and countless other entries in the genre, follow the same formula. You got your ragtag band of wisecracking, daredevil mercenaries who take on those suicidal missions no one in their right mind would even consider, and they never even blink as they pile up a body count numbering in the hundreds. But hey, it's not about the money. It's never about the money. It's. What. They. Do. As the Voice-Over Guy in the trailer for \\"The Expendables\\" says, \\"It's the only life they've ever known.\\" Well. I'm willing to bet it's not the life they knew in second grade, but you get the idea. The reason I had reasonably high expectations for \\"The Expendables\\" as opposed to absolutely no expectations for \\"The A-Team,\\" is the cast, with Sylvester Stallone front and center, backed by an all-star action movie roster: everyone from Bruce Willis to Steve Austin to Mickey Rourke to Jet Li to Jason Statham to a cameo that would have been a lot more fun if they hadn't given it away in the trailer. Too bad Stallone the director and co-writer couldn't have come up with a better vehicle for Stallone the aging action hero. \\"The Expendables\\" is a schlocky, tiresome, blood-spattered cliche of an action film -- the kind of movie with scene after scene pitting just a handful of anti-heroes against literally dozens of machinegun-wielding henchmen, and you know the henchmen don't stand a chance. Yawn. Take away the big-name cast, and this is the kind of straight-to-video movie you see buried in the bargain bins near the cash register at a convenience store, or playing on Channel 734 in the middle of the night. The we've-seen-it-all-before plot has the frighteningly big-veined Stallone as Barney Ross, the leader of a gang of motorcycle-riding killing machines known as the Expendables. (Guess they knew \\"The Incredibles\\" was already taken.) I don't know how Barney got stuck with that vaudeville comic name, given that he runs with the likes of Gunnar Jensen (Stallone's old \\"Rocky IV\\" foe Dolph Lundgren), Yin Yang (Jet Li, still struggling with the English language), Toll Road (mixed martial arts star Randy Couture) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham). Not to mention Steve Austin as a pain-inflicting bad guy named Paine, and Mickey Rourke in all his wigged-out, whacked-out, perma-tanned, tattooed glory as Tool. That's right, Tool. From the classic rock soundtrack to the wince-inducing puns to the unnecessary romantic detour, \\"The Expendables\\" follows the 1985 action-movie blueprint, with Ross leading a team of mercenaries hired by the CIA to take down a South American general-dictator and the American businessman (Eric Roberts) who's bankrolling the general's cocaine operation. \\"The Expendables\\" is at its campy best in scenes featuring those leather-skinned hams, Rourke or Roberts. (Too bad they don't have any scenes together.) In the midst of all the hard-R mayhem, Rourke has an extended closeup monologue in which he talks about how he lost what was left of his soul on a long-ago mission. It's either great or terrible acting, maybe a little of both. And Roberts has a couple of priceless moments, including his commentary on the complications caused by the general's sexy rebel daughter: \\"Bad Shakespeare!\\" Uh-huh. The violence in \\"The Expendables\\" is fast and furious, with Stallone favoring digital splatter moments from the Robert Rodriguez catalog, making you wince before you laugh at the gratuitous lunacy of it all. Heads explode, knives are lodged in necks and there's a lot of rapid-fire cutting during the endless parade of one-on-one battles. (In the middle of all that, there's an uncomfortably realistic water-boarding scene in which the general's daughter is tortured within an inch of her life. It's the movie's worst and ugliest moment.) Stallone still has some charisma left, and all these guys know how to fight and how to deliver deadpan one-liners. But this is just a hyper-violent variation on \\"Grown-Ups.\\" Why get all these likable veteran actors together if you're just going to go through the motions? ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or key ideas in a story, article, video, or any other type of content.

One year has passed, and Buford still has a hard time dealing with it. He goes to his wife's grave and breaks down, telling her that if he had listened to her about not being sheriff, she would still be alive.Buford then goes to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation wanting to know why John Witter (Logan Ramsey) (the mobster who ordered the ambush) is not in jail. Buford is told that there is nothing that can be done since they have no case against him. Pinky Dobson is paralyzed and his girlfriend retracted her statement implicating Witter. Buford then goes to see his friend, attorney Lloyd Tatum (Sandy McPeak) and asks if this is the case. Lloyd tells Buford that it's just the way the law reads, and he will have to be patient and let the TBI do their job.John Witter is now in New York, and tells his boss (Morgan Woodward) that he will settle things with Buford once and for all. The boss tells Witter that he should face the fact that Pusser beat him, and let it be at that.

The makers of The Coronation were able to tell Elizabeth where her father hid the most precious of the crown jewels during World War II, reports the BBC. The answer: inside a cookie tin. Specifically, a tin of Bath Oliver cookies, per the Washington Post. King George VI then ordered the tin itself buried under what was essentially an escape tunnel within Windsor Castle, just in case the Nazis invaded. The revelation came to light thanks to letters from the royal librarian to Queen Mary, the mother of George VI. Vanity Fair highlights other points from the documentary, including one from Elizabeth's childhood. It seems her father instructed her to write a report about his coronation, in order to help prepare her for her own in the future. Here's a snippet: \\"At the end the service got rather boring as it was all prayers,\\" she wrote. \\"Grannie and I were looking to see how many more pages to the end, and we turned one more and then I pointed to the word at the bottom of the page and it said 'Finis.' We both smiled at each other and turned back to the service.\\" (Read about a cursed diamond that was bestowed on Queen Victoria.)","response":"Title: Hidden Treasures: The Secrets of Royal Jewels Unearthed in New BBC Documentary The royal family has always captivated the fascination and imagination of both the British public and the world. In a new BBC documentary, The Coronation, intriguing details about the British monarchy are revealed, including one that even came as a surprise to Queen Elizabeth II. The Coronation, which aired on BBC One, offered viewers a glimpse into the history of the crown jewels, as well as the significance of the events surrounding the coronation ceremonies. During the course of the documentary, it is revealed that Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, had hidden the most valuable of the crown jewels during World War II in a decidedly unassuming location: a cookie tin. The personification of the saying, “the best hiding place is in plain sight,” this historical revelation reports that King George VI ordered the Bath Oliver cookie tin, which housed the precious jewels, to be secreted away within an escape tunnel at Windsor Castle. The king decided to take this course of action as a precautionary measure in case the Nazis were to invade England. The truth about the hiding place of these priceless artifacts came to light via a series of letters exchanged between the royal librarian and Queen Mary, the mother of King George VI. This hidden piece of history might have remained buried if not for the thorough research conducted by the makers of The Coronation. In addition to unveiling this fascinating secret, the documentary also delved into various aspects of the British monarchy. One such aspect was the experiences surrounding the coronations of previous kings and queens, with snippets of Queen Elizabeth's own account of her father's ceremony. In preparation for her future role as the monarch, King George VI had instructed his young daughter to write a report about his coronation. She highlighted the more tedious parts of the service, saying, \\"At the end the service got rather boring as it was all prayers,\\" followed by an anecdote about how she and her grandmother were counting the pages left, amused to find that the word \\"Finis\\" finally appeared at the end. The documentary provides an intimate and rare look at the inner workings of the royal family, and the lengths they have gone to in order to protect the precious symbols of their monarchy. It also underscores Queen Elizabeth's deep sense of duty, even from a young age, and how that has shaped her more than six decades on the throne. The Coronation not only offers an enthralling peek into previously untold stories of royal life but also gives viewers a deeper understanding and appreciation for the richness of British royal history and the indelible mark it has left on the nation. As our interest in the lives and experiences of the monarchy continues to grow, revelations like these serve to further captivate and enthrall both casual and dedicated enthusiasts of royal history."},{"question":"Information: - \\"Hands Clean\\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, for her fifth studio album, \\"Under Rug Swept,\\" which she released in 2002. It was written, composed, and produced by Morissette herself, and released as the album's lead single on 8 February 2002. It is a pop rock song, featuring a shuffling, largely acoustic-rock framework. Lyrically, \\"Hands Clean\\" caused controversy, since it is reportedly the singers recollection of a forbidden sexual relationship she shared with a much older man when she was approximately 14 years of age. - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums. Afterwards, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, and in 1995 released \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million units globally and is her most critically acclaimed work. Her following album, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", was released in 1998. - \\"Precious Illusions\\" is a song written, recorded and produced by Alanis Morissette, for her fifth album \\"Under Rug Swept\\" (2002). It released as the album's second and final international single on 5 August 2002. Its lyrics describe a conflict between idealism and realism, and its protagonist refers to her childhood fancies as \\"precious illusions\\" that she has distanced herself from with a feeling that reminds her of \\"parting with an imaginary friend\\". - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions. - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Under Rug Swept is the fifth studio album and third internationally released album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced all on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in 12 countries, including the United States and Canada, and produced the singles \\"Hands Clean\\" and \\"Precious Illusions\\". Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums. - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - \`\` Utopia '' is a pop rock song written by Alanis Morissette , and produced by her for her fifth album , Under Rug Swept ( 2002 ) . - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as \\"black smokers\\". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.Large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around 2 °C (36 °F) and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometres (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles).

A:","response":"Based on the context provided, seabed mining, specifically the extraction of minerals like manganese nodules, seafloor massive sulphide deposits, and methane clathrate, has advantages over land-based mining. These advantages include: 1. Lower infrastructure costs: Seabed mining equipment can be built at specialized shipyards, which could potentially reduce the overall cost of the infrastructure needed for mining operations compared to land-based mines. Also, several resources can be extracted from the seabed within close proximity, further lowering the costs. 2. Highly concentrated and high-quality resources: The seabed contains vast reserves of high-quality minerals, such as silver, gold, copper, lead, zinc, and other trace metals. Moreover, manganese nodules, which can cover up to 30% of the deep ocean floor in the Pacific, are highly concentrated resources that can be extremely profitable if successfully extracted. 3. Offshore oil and gas: The seabed contains large deposits of petroleum as oil and natural gas, which can be extracted using offshore platforms and drilling rigs. Although the extraction of these resources can be challenging due to harsh environments, it remains a significant advantage over some land-based mining operations. However, it is crucial to note that seabed mining comes with several disadvantages and risks, such as environmental damage, coastal erosion, technical difficulties posed by waves and tides, siltation of excavations, and washing away of spoil heaps. The long-term impact of seabed mining on marine ecosystems is not fully understood, and the high costs associated with developing deep-sea mining technologies are also a significant challenge."},{"question":"Barry and his friend, Jim, went horseback riding across central Texas.

Question: Who captures Becky? Movie plot title: Resident Evil: Retribution Movie plot: In this fifth Resident Evil film, picking up immediately after the events in the previous film (Resident Evil: Afterlife), Alice (Milla Jovovich) and the others on the Umbrella Corporation freighter Arcadia face an attack by a fleet of airships led by Alice's former ally, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), who's been brainwashed by Umbrella through a scarab device attached to her chest. The Umbrella troops kill many people on the freighter. Alice opens fire on the aerial armada and hits one airship, causing it to crash into Arcadia, resulting in an explosion that knocks her out and into the water. The fates of Chris, Claire, K-Mart and the rest of the people on board remains ambiguous.The story switches to a suburban housewife who appears to be Alice living with her husband Todd (Oded Fehr) and deaf daughter Becky (Aryana Engineer). Zombies attack, revealing the suburbia is actually Raccoon City during the contamination. Alice and Becky escape to the streets and are rescued by a student, Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), who lets them ride in her car. As the three escape, they are hit by a truck, knocking Rain unconscious while Alice and Becky escape. Alice hides Becky, but is killed by a zombified Todd.The original Alice awakens to see she's been captured. Jill interrogates Alice, who unsuccessfully tries jogging her memory, and demands to know what happened to Chris, Claire, and K-Mart. During a power failure, Alice escapes her cell and the laser grid, finding herself on the Shibuya Square, just at the beginning of the Tokyo contamination. Fighting her way out, she returns into the facility, and encounters Ada Wong (Li Bingbing), one of Albert Wesker's (Shawn Roberts) top agents. Ada explains they no longer serve Umbrella. Wesker appears on a screen, revealing the Red Queen, who was reactivated after the contamination of The Hive, now controls Umbrella. Ada explains the base is underwater, located in Kamchatka, Russia, that served as a former Soviet outpost; as the Hive was designed in producing the T-Virus,... The answer is:","response":"In the movie Resident Evil: Retribution, it is not explicitly mentioned who captures Becky. However, after Alice hides Becky while escaping from the zombies and the zombified Todd, the narrative shifts to the original Alice who wakes up captured. It is not clear what happens to Becky during this time or who specifically captures her."},{"question":"Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to get free products at sephora stores Locate your nearest sephora store.

The review indicates that the reviewer had unmet expectations and suggests that the product did not provide enough value for them. Below are some reasons why this specific review might negatively influence your decision to buy the product: 1. Disappointment with the product content: The reviewer mentions that they bought the product because of an actor's involvement (Fred Weller), but they were disappointed with how little he was featured. This indicates that the product might not even fully satisfy fans of a specific actor, let alone someone with no prior affinity to any cast member. 2. Regret in purchasing: The reviewer states that they should have rented the product instead of purchasing it. This implies that even after consuming the content, they believe the product wasn't worth the investment. As a potential buyer, you might also consider renting or streaming the product as an alternative to purchasing based on this feedback. 3. Lack of positive reinforcement: The review doesn't include any positive aspects of the product or mention any redeeming features. As a result, there is no counterbalance to the negative experience shared by the reviewer, which might leave a lasting impression on potential buyers. 4. Emphasis on alternative options: By suggesting they should have rented it instead, the reviewer might influence others to explore other ways of accessing the content, like renting, borrowing, or streaming, instead of purchasing the product outright.

Tom Brook examines the potential risks and rewards of the religious blockbuster. It was an intriguing image and it caught Twitter users' imagination – a massive wooden replica of Noah's Ark under construction in suburban New York. \\"I dreamt about this since I was 13,\\" tweeted Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky, whose epic film of Noah’s life is set for release next March. \\"And now it's a reality.\\" This enormous set is a rare extravagance in the age of CGI pictures. And in more ways than one, it looks back to an older style of movie-making. It heralds a flood of Hollywood films on biblical themes. There are two planned Moses pictures in the works, with Ang Lee and Ridley Scott rumoured as directors. Then there’s a Cain and Abel story in development. Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed last year they’d given approval for production to go ahead through Will Smith’s production company. Other religious films are also being incubated. Hollywood’s interest in biblical epics is to some extent cyclical – in the 1950s and early 60s they were a staple. Legendary filmmaker Cecil B DeMille made a big impact with The Ten Commandments in which Charlton Heston played Moses. Other biblical hits from the time included Solomon and Sheba, David and Bathsheba and Ben-Hur. These films dominated the box office. But not all the religious films from the era resonated with an audience. One of the best-known – The Greatest Story Ever Told – didn’t do well commercially. And several didn’t meet with the approval of reviewers. The New York Times critic wrote that the biblical epic King of Kings, narrated by Orson Wells, had “the nature of an illustrated lecture.” Recently interest in religious-themed films has been heightened as the Hollywood studios have, once again, come to realise there’s a potentially huge audience for biblical fare. Not necessarily earth-shattering news when you take into account that a Gallup poll conducted last year found more than 75 per cent of Americans identify with a Christian religion. But what’s got Hollywood’s attention in the past few weeks is the just-completed American TV series The Bible on the History Channel. This miniseries – which dramatised the Bible in five two-hour programmes – became a surprise blockbuster. It reached an audience of more than 13 million with its first episode – an unusually large viewing figure for a miniseries on cable TV. Reality TV impresario Mark Burnett, who co-produced the series with his wife actress Roma Downey, clearly thinks there’s a demand for religious entertainment. “We believe in the Bible, we believe in Jesus and that’s the number one subject right now in America. And that’s great!” he says. The success of the History Channel’s The Bible has animated studio executives. Paul Degarabedian, box office analyst for Hollywood.com, says: “I think that’s maybe the foremost thing on their minds right now: that if done properly Bible-based movies could potentially be moneymaking and profitable.” But catering to the growing interest in biblical adventures presents the Hollywood studios with a challenge: how to create a movie that will engage both secular audiences as well as those who strongly identify with their religious background? Screenplays have to be thoughtfully composed to reach audiences everywhere. It’s not an easy feat if you’re trying to reach a worldwide audience that includes people who practice very different religions. Making the right kind of religious films is difficult for the studios as Toby Miller, author of Global Hollywood 2, confirms. “It’s a big issue in overseas sales,” he says. “How Christian can you get? How Old Testament can you get? ” Hollywood has engendered heated controversies in the past when it has taken on religious stories. Biblical characters are seen as sacrosanct. California-based Brian Godawa, a filmmaker who writes and directs spiritual stories, has taken exception to the forthcoming film Noah. Based on his reading of the screenplay he says: “They’re turning it into a political propaganda piece for environmentalism. What they’ve done is made the meaning of the Noah story into something that’s not in the Bible.” He adds: “We’ll just have to wait and see what happens with Noah because if it’s as anti-biblical as I think religious people won’t want to see it.” Whether or not planned religious movies create criticism, Hollywood is not going to hold back given the promise of big box office rewards. Another strong factor encouraging the studios to explore biblical stories is that Hollywood’s big staple – the superhero films of recent years – may have run their course. “It’s true there isn’t much that is left to be mined but it is clear there is a massive appetite for that kind of story,” says Professor Miller. Religious epics, if carefully calibrated, could perhaps satisfy the appetites of the superhero audience. The studios have already peddled god-like superheroes and met with box office success. Take Thor – the Kenneth Branagh directed action-adventure released two years ago which took in more than 180m at the international box office. The character of Thor in the movie certainly had a religious dimension. As Professor Miller says: “Thor is a god, or a semi-god, able to go beyond the human norm and provide inspiration to the conventional person,” Paul Degarabedian believes given the right treatment all the excitement of the Bible – the events, battles and intrigue – could be fashioned into an appealing blockbuster. “That could be something that could totally cross over that would be cinematic, compelling, entertaining that could be huge if it’s done with the proper balance of secular style storytelling,” he says. But Brian Godawa is pessimistic, arguing that secular Hollywood doesn’t really understand religion. “The problem is that many people in Hollywood are not spiritually, religiously inclined – they don’t understand the Bible. They don’t understand Christianity or Judaism. They import their own views into it.” What some studio executives would like to see is a replication of the success of Mel Gibson’s 2004 religious epic The Passion of The Christ which depicted the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus. The film made more than 600m around the world. Despite considerable controversy – and charges of anti-Semitism – it was a religious film that did reach beyond the US Christian community. It also made headway in countries with large Muslim populations such as Egypt. But it was banned in other parts of the Muslim world for different reasons – partly because the crucifixion, so vividly depicted in the picture, contradicts the Koran. Some commentators see the success of The Passion of The Christ as specifically connected to both the socio-political climate in the US at the time it was launched and Mel Gibson’s stature. He personally financed the film which also benefitted from a very effective marketing campaign that relied heavily on church groups. Right now Hollywood is mired in soul-searching looking for new ways to reach audiences of all kinds both religious and secular. Religious epics remain risky ventures but they could be part of the answer – if done properly the payoff could be huge.

Last December, Jodie T. Allen of the Pew Research Center had the smart idea of comparing the views of today’s Americans with the views of Americans during the Great Depression. The results remind you how much public opinion has shifted in a pro-capitalist direction over the past 80 years. Three-quarters of Americans in 1937 believed that the government should provide free or easy loans to farmers so they could buy land. More Americans favored a concentration of power at the federal level than at the state level. Fifty-two percent believed government should have more power to regulate business and agriculture, while only 36 percent opposed giving it more power. By a margin of 59 percent to 29 percent, Americans favored public ownership of the power industry. Sixty-nine percent of Americans said the government should nationalize the munitions industry. On the other hand, people in the depression sided with companies more than with unions and majorities opposed efforts by the government to limit private fortunes. How to interpret these shifts? It could be that the country has moved rightward, even though academia, the media and most of the communications industry has moved leftward. It could be that Americans, then as now, had a constant image of the role government should play in American life. Then, government didn’t quite live up to that image but now it overspills it. Or we could be just seeing the collapse of fascism. When asked if they preferred fascism to communism, 39 percent of depression-era Americans preferred fascism and 25 percent preferred communism. Back then, conservatives had an anti-market ideology they could subscribe to. That vision died with World War II and now it is hard to be right-leaning and anti-market.

I say this despite being a constitutionally unhappy person who has fought all her life against an encroaching darkness — and not always successfully. Those moments stretch back decades — to, say, summer mornings in a rented cottage on Block Island, when I, an inveterate late sleeper, would be awakened shortly past dawn by my 10-month-old daughter, Zoë, standing up in her crib, cheerfully gurgling at me, raring to begin the day. And they are as recent as last week when Zoë, now 22, and I engaged in one of our long analytical talks about the movie we had just watched, and I was struck by the ways in which her mind works differently from mine and by certain perceptual habits we have in common. My battles with chronic depression have landed me in a psychiatric unit several times since my daughter was born. She was 6 months old when I was first hospitalized, 7 years old the second time, and 18 the last time. I worry about the impact on her of those separations, relatively short as they were, and I worry more about the effect of living with a mother who often fights to keep afloat. (I have been divorced from Zoë’s father since she was about 4, and we have spent large periods of one-on-one time together.) Although I know that depression is not something you can catch from another person, like chickenpox, I fear that my susceptibility will somehow “rub off” on my daughter — that she might pattern her responses to life’s inevitable difficulties after my own. I will never forget the time when she was a little girl, no more than 6 or 7, and announced one evening after I had gotten angry with her about something, that she was taking a kitchen knife to bed in order to kill herself. I remember that she was wearing her favorite pajamas, which were imprinted with pink bows, when she said this and how incongruous such a declaration seemed, coming from someone whose bedtime was 7:30. Panic-stricken, I rushed after her into her room, pried away the knife and attempted to soothe her, and read to her until she fell asleep. She never repeated this gesture or anything like it, but I feel intensely guilty even now as I recall it, since I can only assume that she modeled her behavior on some distraught conversation she had overheard in which I threatened to take desperate action. As Zoë has grown, it has become harder to shield her from my periods of acute despair; she has heard me express suicidal wishes and, at the worst points, has observed me sink into virtual immobility and wordlessness. I have been thinking about such matters lately because of the comedian Sarah Silverman’s remark on a TV talk show that she didn’t want to have a child of her own and preferred to adopt for fear of passing on her depression. Much as I sympathize with Ms. Silverman’s trepidations (assuming they were meant to be taken seriously), I think they suggest the undue influence we assign to genetic determinability. This is a fairly recent phenomenon, one that can be accounted for by the latest pendulum swing in the nature versus nurture debate. The 1950s and ’60s saw a consuming belief in the importance of environmental factors in the shaping of personality; this led to such handy but reductive concepts as the “schizophrenogenic” mother and Bruno Bettelheim’s theory that withholding mothers caused autism. Now, with greater knowledge of how our brains work, we live under the tyranny of the biological. Where once we feared the input of our own unwitting selves, we now fear the imprint of our chemically ordained destinies. So how heritable is depression? There is no single genetic marker for it; current research shows that multiple genes probably contribute simultaneously to its chances of being transmitted. Research is hard in this area because we can’t perform the perfect experiment — separating identical twins at birth and raising them in different homes to see which get depressed and which don’t. Scientists can, however, compare identical twins (conceived from the same egg and sperm) with fraternal twins (conceived from different eggs and sperm) and see how they differ. Such twin studies have recently concluded that the heritability of depression is about 40 percent.

Meanwhile, metal objects in the microwave can cause a spark when they come into contact with electromagnetic waves. Aluminium foil is a metal, and when placed in the microwave, it can potentially create a fire hazard and damage the microwave oven. In considering the possible consequences of putting aluminium foil in the microwave, I come to the conclusion that the answer is no, it is not safe."},{"question":"How is \\"In tandem with this proposal, the Commission submitted a general report on the workings of the guarantee fund, which concludes that the fund continued to meet its main objectives during the 1998-2002 period.\\" said in Finnish?","response":"Kun selitän viisivuotiaalle, ensin kerron, mistä tekstissä on kyse.

The action is set in San Francisco during the 1980s. Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop.

It is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is considered one of the most prestigious events in the sport. Initially, the competition only featured men's singles, which led to the prohibition of women's participation. It wasn't until 1884 when women's singles, as well as men's doubles, were introduced. Wimbledon commenced on July 9, 1877, at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club located in Wimbledon, London. The tournament was established as an amateur competition to raise funds to repair the club's pony roller. The competition's early years witnessed only a few participants, with a total of 22 players taking part in the inaugural men's singles event. Spencer Gore emerged as the first Wimbledon champion by defeating William Marshall in the final. The format of the tournament during the initial years consisted of a challenge round, wherein the defending champion only played the final match against the winner of what is now known as the \\"All-Comers\\" competition. When it was announced that the first Wimbledon Championships would not include women or doubles divisions, women's rights activists and sports enthusiasts voiced their dissatisfaction. Realizing the importance of inclusivity in sports, Wimbledon organizers decided to introduce both women's singles and men's doubles events in 1884. Maud Watson became the first-ever woman to win the women's singles title at Wimbledon by defeating Lillian Watson, her sister. The introduction of ladies' events marked a significant milestone in the history of women's sports and indicated a positive shift in societal attitudes towards gender equality. The Ladies' doubles and mixed doubles events were later added in 1913, making Wimbledon a full-fledged tennis championship featuring all five major events - men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The tournament has continued to evolve since its inception, and today, it is a Grand Slam event that enjoys worldwide recognition and attracts the best tennis players globally."},{"question":"Well what I can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many Asian faces.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. I am facing a new situation today: John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A? The answer to this question is:","response":"Era B would see less rocks with chemical reactions than Era A. The decrease in rainfall during Era B means that less rainwater passes through the soil and reacts chemically with rock particles.

(CNN) -- Soraya Bahgat, a Cairo-based HR executive and postgraduate student, was on her way to join Tahrir Square protests on November 25 when an unwelcome thought stopped her in her tracks. Mobs in the square had sexually assaulted women protesters there a week earlier, and reports of such incidents had become common enough for her to fear a repeat occurrence. \\"A panic attack gripped me and prevented me from going because I thought no woman should go through this,\\" said the 29-year-old. \\"It was almost two years since the Lara Logan incident,\\" she said, referring to the harrowing sexual attack on the CBS correspondent by a mob in Tahrir Square.","response":"The sentence ends with the account of Soraya Bahgat's thoughts and feelings on that day, highlighting the fear and high-risk situation for women protesters in Tahrir Square due to repeated incidents of sexual assaults. The article continues by explaining how Bahgat took matters into her own hands to address the issue of safety for women protesters. She founded an organization called Tahrir Bodyguard, which comprised of volunteers wearing bright yellow vests to form protective rings around female protesters and prevent sexual harassment. The group's presence acted as a deterrent to potential perpetrators, and they worked in collaboration with other organizations like Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment and Assault, which provided medical and psychological support to the victims. A broader discussion addressing the prevalence of sexual harassment in Egypt at the time commenced. Demonstrations and protests in public spaces had often empowered men to take advantage of vulnerable situations, and it was reported that over 99% of Egyptian women had experienced some form of harassment. The Egyptian government's lack of action and strict consequences for sexual harassment offenders further exacerbated the issue. In 2014, Egypt introduced new laws that specifically criminalized sexual harassment and enforced harsher penalties on convicted harassers, yet many believe that the real change can only come from society's attitude toward women and the need for respect, understanding, and consent in every interaction. Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of women-focused organizations, like Tahrir Bodyguard and Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment and Assault, in providing much-needed support, safety measures, and awareness about the rampant issue of sexual harassment in Egypt. It is through such collective efforts that change can be initiated and sustained, allowing women to feel safe and exercise their rights to free speech and peaceful protest without the fear of being harassed or assaulted."},{"question":"Este într-adevăr o iniţiativă care se îndreaptă în direcţia corectă.

The car was sold in various markets with different names. In this sentence, the emphasis is on the fact that the car was sold in various markets.

Stephanie Mack has revealed that she was so overcome. with emotion that she threw up the first time she went back into the home where. her husband killed himself. The widow of Mark Madoff said that she was also horrified to. still see the marks left by the dog leash on one of the beams which he used in. the hanging. Miss Mack said that she never intended to go back to. the apartment in Manhattan, New York, but did so along with their two children to give. them some ‘normalcy’. New home: Stephanie Mack revealed that she was so overcome with emotion that she threw up the first time she went back into the home where her husband Mark killed himself. In an interview she also revealed that for the first time. she is thinking about forgiving Bernie Madoff having previously said she would. ‘spit in his face’ if she saw him again. Miss Mack had vowed she would never set foot in her old. apartment in Manhattan after Mark’s suicide in 2010. He and his brother Andrew were the ones who turned in their. father in late 2008 over his £41 billion Ponzi scheme. He is now serving 150 years in jail for his crimes but the. fallout on his family has been even more devastating - with Mark unable to cope. with the pressure. Speaking to Harper’s Bazaar, Miss Mack, 37, said that. she decided to return to the SoHo loft with Audrey, five, Nicholas, three and. her own parents. New life: The widow of Mark Madoff said that she was also horrified to still see the marks left by the dog leash on one of the beams which Mark used in the hanging at their old home. She said: ‘I thought, you know, I need to bring, like,. normalcy back to their life? But when I got home and walked in the door, I threw up.’ Magazine: Stephanie Mack gave an interview in the 'Spring Fashion Issue' of Harper's Bazaar. Miss Mack had hired a builder to ‘cover up’ the steel. beam from which Mark hanged himself but unfortunately she could still see the. ‘scuff marks on the ceiling’. She said: ‘I mean, this is so gruesome, like, I guess from. hanging the dog leash over the thing. 'I don't know. And then the floor, from a. certain area, was really scratched up. I tried to figure out some clues and. stuff.’ Now living in a rented apartment in the Tribeca area of. Manhattan with her children, Miss Mack opened up about how Mark’s death. had affected them. She said they don’t talk about ‘Grandpa Bernie’ too much and. when asked about their father they say: ‘Daddy got a boo-boo on his brain that. made his heart stop.’ But more than a year after her husband’s death, Miss Mack said that she was only now entertaining the idea of forgiveness. She said that in her gym class her instructor was talking. about how ‘if you don't have forgiveness, you're stuck’. She said: ‘I'm not going to be stuck. I'm going to move forward. I'm not going to let Bernie Madoff ruin my life anymore.’ Couple: More than a year after her husband Mark (right) died, Stephanie Mack said that she was only now entertaining the idea of forgiving her father-in-law Bernie. Family: Stephanie Mack's (left picture,. right) husband Mark Madoff (left picture, centre) committed suicide. after his father Bernie Madoff (right) was jailed - leaving two kids. including Nicholas (left picture, left) Last year Miss Mack gave an interview to ABC News in. which she said that if she saw Bernie she’d tell him ‘that I hold him. fully responsible for killing my husband, and I’d spit in his face’. 'I thought, you know, I need to bring, like, normalcy back to their life? But when I got home and walked in the door, I threw up' Stephanie Mack. She also wrote a bitter memoir titled ‘The End Of Normal: A. Wife’s Anguish, A Widow’s New Life’ in which she talked of how she coped with. the public humiliation of being part of America’s most notorious family. The book detailed how Bernie once eyed up her bottom. when she was pregnant with his grandchild and made crude jokes about how big it. was. Miss Mack also said that his wife Ruth was such a diet. freak she poured copious amounts of salt on food to stop her eating any more. than she deemed sufficient. Tragedy: Officials carry Mark's body out of his New York home after he was found hanged in December 2010. She is now calling herself 'Mack' as opposed to her former 'Madoff Mack' because she wants to avoid the hassle people give her. House of horror: The Manhattan apartment in which Mark Madoff was found hanged in SoHo, Manhattan. 'It just sucked to, like, pick up a prescription at the pharmacy and have someone say something,' she said. 'I don't feel ashamed anymore, but I don't want to have to hear it.' She chose the name Mack because of the M from Madoff and 'ACK', which is the airport code for Nantucket, the Massachusetts town where she and Mark loved spending time together. She told People magazine last October she felt ‘betrayed’ by Bernie and has not forgiven Ruth, or her husband’s brother Andrew, for allegedly abandoning Mark. Her late husband relentlessly followed news coverage about his father and failed in a 2009 suicide attempt, leaving a note saying his life was 'destroyed' and telling his dad: ‘F**k you’, she added. She told ABC that her daughter Audrey sometimes shouts ‘I love you, daddy!’ in the sky and recently asked her: ‘Why didn’t daddy take his cell phone with him when he died?’, reported People magazine. The couple wed in 2004 after meeting on a blind date when Miss Mack worked in fashion and Mark worked in finance. But she said his ‘handsome face aged overnight’ when Bernie was jailed. ‘The smile that made me fall in love with him disappeared altogether,’ she wrote in her book, adding that Mark would obsessively follow news reports in fear of being implicated in the scandal.

Options: - college campus - players - high school - texas - oklahoma Explain why a human would choose \\"college campus\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"college campus\\" as the answer to the question above because it provides the most logical and relevant context for the given situation. The question states that over a hundred thousand people will be present at the football field, which strongly suggests a significant event, such as a popular and important football game. In the United States, football games with large crowds are often associated with college campuses where college football is a major sporting and social event. Colleges often have large stadiums that can accommodate thousands of spectators, and the games serve as significant gatherings for students, alumni, and fans. Now considering the other given options: - Players: This doesn't fit the context of being a \\"spot\\" or a location; it refers to the athletes participating in the game. - High School: While high school football games can be popular, they typically do not draw crowds as large as a hundred thousand people. - Texas and Oklahoma: These are states and do not denote a specific location or relevance to the football field being a popular spot. Hence, among all the options, \\"college campus\\" is the most logical choice as it provides the best context for a popular football field with a large crowd."},{"question":"Write a question about the following article: For the period 2011-15, the estimated median annual income for a household in the town was 48,059, and the median income for a family was 96,005.

Be as objective as possible when explaining the circumstances and ask for an unbiased opinion. Talking over your problem with family, a friend, a therapist, or a clergy member may help you come to a good decision as to how best to handle the situation. If it gets back to your friend that you have been talking about them behind their back (even if it was not a negative conversation), then you may not be in the driver's seat about ending it any more. You and your friend have already had a fight bad enough for you to consider whether or not the friendship can survive. Don't complicate things by talking about it with someone you both know; talk to someone outside your shared circle. Ask a friend, family member, or even the friend you fought with (if you are speaking to each other) about how you contributed to the fight. Maybe they can help you see something in your personality that is contributing to the problem in your friendship. Be sure to think about the feedback the person gives you and why they might be giving you this feedback. If you think your fight was more about your own problems than your friend, talk to your friend about it. You could say, “I think part of the reason why our fight was so bad was because I have been dealing with a lot of stress lately. I took it out on you, and I am sorry,” or “I’ve ditched friends in the past after getting into fights with them, and I think it’s a pattern with me.” If your conversations reveal patterns in your behavior that are troubling you, then you may wish to seek professional help. For example, your friends and family tell you that you have a volatile temper, then you may want to seek help. Consider talking to a counselor about your concerns. Keep in mind that good communication skills are essential to healthy relationships. Work on building your communication skills and body language to express yourself more effectively to friends, family, and coworkers. If you and your friend are on speaking terms, you could decide to talk about the fight and figure out what went wrong and attempt to compromise with them. Make sure you do this when you are calm and able to keep your emotions in check. It may be good to wait a few days for to get over the raw emotions. Find a time and place to talk privately. You could say, “I think we need to talk about what happened. Would you be able to meet me this afternoon?” Don’t go into your conversation with an agenda. Keep an open mind about what your friend has to say and listen to their perspective. Remember, you don’t want to continue your fight, you want to figure out if this friendship is worth saving. If your friend gets argumentative, you could say, “I don’t want to argue, I just want to figure out what’s going on with us. If we can’t do that without anger, then maybe we should take a break.” You could decide to follow up later with another conversation, or make the decision to keep your distance from the person. Compromising can be a win-win situation for you and your friend. To find middle ground for a compromise, try asking questions like, \\"Is this something where I have to have the final say and be right?\\" \\"What is it that I am right about?\\" \\"Is this something that is of value to the other person?\\" \\"Is it okay that they have their own opinions on a particular matter?\\" \\"Is my conflict with this person or issue more important than my friendship?\\" \\"Is it worth spending so much time and energy arguing, or would our time be better spent in a more positive interaction?\\" You and your friend could discuss what each of you see as problems in your relationship, and figure out how each of you can help solve the problem. Make sure both of you keep an open mind and listen to what the other person has to say. Name the problem and suggest a fix. For example, maybe your friend is not good at returning your texts and calls. You could say, “You don’t have to respond to every single text, but it really hurts my feelings when you don’t communicate with me, especially when I need to talk to someone. Do you think you could do a better job of responding to me?” Listen to your friend’s concerns. Acknowledge their point of view. For example, you could say, “I can see how you would think I was ignoring you when I was talking to Juan. I’m sorry that I hurt you. What I was really doing was….”","response":"The process of addressing and resolving a conflict within a friendship starts by choosing a trusted person outside your circle of friends to discuss the situation with, in order to prevent gossip and misunderstandings. It is important to maintain objectivity and ask for an unbiased opinion from the person you confide in, whether it be a family member, a friend, a therapist, or a clergy member, to help in determining the best course of action. While reflecting on the fight you had with your friend, consider talking to others about your own contribution to the disagreement and any patterns of behavior that may be contributing to the problem. Taking the time to objectively analyze the feedback received from others will help in understanding the root cause of the issue. If the issue seems to be more about personal problems than the other friend, consider apologizing and acknowledging the role your stress or patterns played in the conflict. If the conversations uncover any troubling patterns in your behavior, seeking professional help, such as talking to a counselor, might be beneficial. Working on improving your communication skills and body language can help to effectively express yourself in various relationships. If it's viable to have a calm conversation with your friend, make an effort to understand their perspective, without an agenda; the main focus should be on deciding whether the friendship is worth saving. Maintaining patience and keeping emotions in check is crucial during this conversation. If the discussion becomes argumentative, consider taking a break and revisiting the conversation later or deciding to keep distance from the person. Compromising with your friend plays a vital role in resolving the conflict by finding middle ground and asking important questions to understand each other's points of view. It's important to prioritize the value of the friendship over the need to be right. Engage in open dialogue with your friend to identify the problems within the relationship and suggest possible solutions. Actively listen to your friend's concerns and acknowledge their point of view. Through honest communication, sincere apologies, and a shared commitment to resolving issues, the friendship can be strengthened and endure future conflicts."},{"question":"the most common crimes in the ACT are property related crimes, unlawful entry with intent and motor vehicle theft.

Question 2: If you were a fat teen and you could go back, what will you do differently? Select from the following. A). no B). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Question 1: The highest chemical engineering package after M.Tech in India largely depends on several factors including the institute from which the degree is obtained, the individual's experience and skill set, the company providing the package, and the job location. With that said, fresh graduates of Chemical Engineering with an M.Tech degree from top institutes like IITs or NITs can expect to receive starting salary packages in the range of INR 10-15 lakh per annum, which can go as high as INR 25-30 lakh per annum at senior positions or in well-known global companies. It is crucial to note that these figures can vary greatly depending on the specific situation and company. Question 2: If I were a fat teen and could go back in time, I would make a series of changes to improve my health, fitness, and overall well-being. Firstly, I would consult a doctor or a certified nutritionist to help develop a balanced and sustainable meal plan. This meal plan would emphasize healthier food choices, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and good fats, while avoiding unhealthy processed foods high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat. Next, I would incorporate regular physical activity into my daily routine. This could involve finding a sport that I enjoy – such as swimming, cycling, or basketball – or developing an exercise regime that includes a mixture of strength training and cardio workouts. Additionally, I would aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, as recommended by the American Heart Association. Furthermore, it is essential to address any underlying emotional or psychological factors contributing to weight gain. This might encompass seeking guidance from a mental health professional, therapist, or support group, or developing coping mechanisms for issues such as stress, anxiety, or depression. Ultimately, cultivating a healthier mindset – one that is centered on self-compassion, perseverance, and mindfulness – will be instrumental in fostering a sustainable lifestyle transformation.

Question 1 pertains to the highest chemical engineering package after M.Tech in India, whereas Question 2 seeks advice regarding optimal health and lifestyle choices for a fat teen looking to make positive changes.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Usually people sleep in kitchen\\" - Sentence B: \\"Usually people sleep in bedroom\\" Answer. Sentence A What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Answer: Sentence A Step-by-step reasoning that justifies the answer: 1. Understanding the context: Both sentences are discussing where people usually sleep. 2. Identifying the common activity: In both sentences, the activity mentioned is 'sleeping,' which is a natural human function that typically takes place in specific locations designed for rest and relaxation. 3. Analyzing the locations: Sentence A mentions the kitchen, while Sentence B mentions the bedroom. a. The kitchen is the room in a house where food is prepared, stored, and sometimes consumed. It typically contains appliances like a stove, refrigerator, and sink, as well as other cooking tools and essentials. Kitchens are not designed for sleep and are primarily meant for cooking and food-related activities. b. The bedroom is a room in a house where people sleep, relax, and may have other personal, intimate, or leisurely activities. Bedrooms are specifically designed for sleep and usually are furnished with a bed, lighting, and other necessities to create a comfortable and conducive environment for rest and sleep. 4.

Honeybees are the primary species of bees that produce honey; they collect nectar from flowers and take it back to their hive to produce honey. 3. Humans have been using honey for thousands of years for various purposes, such as food, medicine, and as a sweetener. 4.

A:","response":"A: The last step of the process would be harvesting the fully-grown vegetables and preparing or storing them for consumption. After diligently planting vegetable seeds in the ground, watering them, waiting for the seeds to sprout, keeping the area free of pests and weeds, and thinning out the plants to provide adequate space for growth, you will finally get to enjoy the fruits (or vegetables) of your labor. Monitoring the growth and development of your vegetable plants, you will need to become familiar with each plant's specific harvesting timeline and indicators. This information is crucial, as it ensures that you collect the vegetables at their peak ripeness, nutritional value, and flavor. Harvesting too early or late might lead to lower quality produce. Once you determine that your vegetables are ripe and ready to harvest, follow these simple rules: 1. Harvest your vegetables early in the morning when the temperature is cooler to reduce wilting and ensure crispness. 2. Use clean, sharp tools, like scissors, pruning shears, or a knife, depending on the type of vegetable, to minimize damage to the plant and reduce the risk of disease. 3. Handle the vegetables gently to avoid bruising or damaging them, which could shorten their shelf life. 4. As some vegetables mature at different rates, you may need to harvest several times throughout the growing season. 5. Rotate your crops yearly to manage soil nutrients and prevent pests or diseases from returning. After harvesting your vegetables, you can prepare them for immediate consumption, or you might choose to store, freeze, or preserve them to extend their shelf life and enjoy them at a later time. To maximize the nutritional benefits and flavor, it is essential to store each type of vegetable with proper humidity, temperature, and light conditions. This way, you can enjoy the wholesome produce that you have worked so hard to grow, nurture, and harvest in a variety of delicious and healthful meals for yourself and your family."},{"question":"What most naturally follows?

Let's explore the amazing world of cursive, hearts, \\"love\\" symbols, and the magical illuminated letters. First, let's learn about cursive writing. Cursive is a way to write letters and words where we connect each letter in a smooth and flowing manner. It's like drawing a pretty line through our letters. It looks really fancy, doesn't it? When we write in cursive, our writing can tell a lovely story that looks like pretty doodles. Now, what if we add some cute hearts and \\"love\\" symbols to our writing? That sounds like a great idea! These little symbols can make our writing look even prettier and full of happy feelings. We can draw a heart or write the word \\"love\\" to show that we care. When our friends or family see our writing full of hearts, they will feel very special. Have you ever heard of illuminated letters? They are big, beautiful, and decorated letters that were used a long, long time ago in fancy books. They look like a piece of art, and they help to make the first letter of a word look super important. We can try drawing illuminated letters with colorful markers and shiny paints to make our writing stand out. If we are typing on a computer or a tablet, we can also use something called a dramatic font. Fonts are like the clothes our letters wear. There are so many styles to choose, and they can change the way our writing looks. A dramatic font can make our words look like they are telling a fantastic adventure story. What do you think, kids? Are you excited to start playing with cursive, hearts, illuminated letters, and fun fonts? This is a great way for us to show love, happiness, and creativity in our writing.

She's a nurse who seeks revenge, on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine. Like any 70s Blaxploitation flick, you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts. There were scores of these films made during the 70s, and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films, and the degrading, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. Other common threads between Coffy, and other films of its type, include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity, and sex-crazed gorgeous women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug-dealers, pimps, mobsters, and other criminal scum. Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of 70s Blaxploitation heroines. She was magnificent, being both tough-as-nails, and drop-dead gorgeous. Like in her other films, Pam outshines the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen, that these sorts of films are unwatchable, without her as the main character. If you like Pam Grier, you're better off seeing her other films, like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Friday Foster. These films have much less empty sleaze, than Coffy does. Pam's character in Coffy, degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films, don't stoop as low to get revenge, as Coffy did. I'd say, only watch Coffy, if you're unable to see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress, makes viewing Coffy bearable.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"To assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is crucial to examine both statements carefully and consider their implications and possible interpretations. Premise: \\"yeah that's you know just minor\\" In the premise, the speaker seems to suggest that something is minor or of little significance or importance. The use of informal language (\\"yeah that's you know\\") further implies a casual and nonchalant attitude towards the subject matter, which might minimize its importance. Hypothesis: \\"You believe it is not just minor.\\" The hypothesis expresses the suspicion that the speaker (or another person) might believe that the situation or issue in question is not as minor as one suggests. This statement implies that the designated person may think that the subject is more significant than implied in the premise. Now, to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, it is necessary to see if the hypothesis is a logical conclusion originating from the premise. In other words, we must analyze whether the information provided in the premise offers sufficient evidence to derive the hypothesis. In this case, the premise and hypothesis seem to express opposing viewpoints. The premise downplays the significance of the situation, while the hypothesis contends that the same person believes it is not minor. Thus, it is evident that these two statements are contradictory in nature. However, one could argue that the speaker's nonchalant language might be interpreted as the speaker trying to downplay the situation, which might lead to the suspicion of the hypothesis that the speaker actually believes it is not just minor. To summarize, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis. Instead, they express contrasting perspectives on the situation. On the one hand, the premise seemingly trivializes the matter, while on the other hand, the hypothesis questions this viewpoint and suspects that the speaker believes the matter is not \\"just minor\\" after all. Although there might be some room for suspicion based on the speaker's language and tone, the premise – at face value – disagrees with the hypothesis rather than entailing it."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. why does Trump continue tweeting? A. not enough information B. he has a large ego C. he thinks it is helping. D. he thinks he is witty Answer:","response":"Donald Trump continues tweeting for a combination of reasons, which include aspects of options B, C, and D mentioned in the question. B. He has a large ego: Trump's tweeting habits can be partly attributed to his ego, as he enjoys sharing his thoughts and opinions directly with the public. Twitter provides an unfiltered platform for him to communicate without the need for intermediaries such as traditional media. This direct communication allows him to maintain a strong presence in the public eye and garner attention, which feeds his ego. C. He thinks it is helping: Trump perceives tweeting as an effective communication tool that keeps his supporters informed and engaged. He has often praised Twitter as a method for him to bypass mainstream media and express his thoughts directly to his followers. As a result, he believes that his tweets are advantageous and essential for maintaining a strong connection with his base, shaping public discourse, and pushing his political agenda. D. He thinks he is witty: Trump is known for his distinctive and often controversial tweeting style, which regularly includes sarcasm and humor. He may see these elements of wit as a way to entertain and engage his followers. This behavior suggests that he believes his tweets are not only informative but also demonstrate his sense of humor and personality, further endearing himself to his supporters. In summary, President Donald Trump continues to tweet because he has a large ego, he believes it is helping with his political agenda and supporter engagement, and he thinks he is witty in his messaging and tone. The tweets undeniably generate discussion and reactions, enabling him to dominate the news cycle and staying central to political discussions, both supportive and critical."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Nice application\\"","response":"It is not possible to accurately assign a star rating based solely on the phrase \\"Nice application,\\" as this statement is quite brief and lacks specific detail.

Question: suppose less chemical changes in stomach happens, how will it affect the pancreas working SOFTER. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"In the given process, the pancreas detects chemical changes in the stomach and responds by creating and releasing digestive juices, which contain enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin for protein digestion. Additionally, insulin production serves to move glucose from the blood. If fewer chemical changes occur in the stomach, this can affect the overall functioning of the pancreas through several ways. Firstly, it may result in the pancreas producing fewer digestive juices, as there are fewer chemical changes in the stomach to signal the need for those juices. This means that the pancreas would function more softly in terms of enzyme production. Less trypsin and chymotrypsin would be generated, reducing the pancreas' efficiency and speed in breaking down proteins. Consequently, the digestion process may occur slower and cause discomfort or other digestive issues. When it comes to the second effect mentioned—the production of insulin for glucose management— diminished chemical changes in the stomach may have less or potentially no effect. Insulin production is mainly regulated by blood glucose levels, which are not directly influenced by chemical changes in the stomach. However, since insulin production and pancreatic enzyme secretion are both functions of the pancreas, it is possible that changes in the overall activity of the pancreas might have indirect effects on insulin production. For instance, if the pancreas is producing less trypsin and chymotrypsin due to fewer chemical changes in the stomach, it's feasible that the overall metabolic activity of the pancreas could decrease, which might have a minor influence on insulin production. In summary, if fewer chemical changes occur in the stomach, the effect on the pancreas working more softly would mostly happen with respect to enzyme production, resulting in less trypsin and chymotrypsin being generated. The influence on insulin production would most likely be less or potentially have no effect since insulin is mainly regulated by blood glucose levels, not the chemical changes in the stomach. However, the pancreas' altered activity could have a subtle indirect impact on insulin production."},{"question":"Alfred North Whitehead Deleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are minority ones, as Whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools. It is impossible to say exactly why Whitehead's influence has not been more widespread, but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive (such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction), or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy, or the perception of metaphysics itself as passé, or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose. Q: Why do some people believe Whitehead's writings may have restricted his influence?","response":"Some people believe that Alfred North Whitehead's writings may have restricted his influence for several reasons: 1. Complex and dense prose: Whitehead's writing style is often considered difficult to comprehend, even for well-versed philosophers. His works, such as \\"Process and Reality\\", require a deep investment of time and effort to fully understand and appreciate his ideas. Readers may find it challenging to penetrate the dense, technical language employed by Whitehead, and as a result, this could contribute to the restricted dissemination of his ideas. 2. Abstract and counterintuitive concepts: Whitehead's metaphysical ideas, such as the notion that matter is an abstraction, can appear counterintuitive and difficult to grasp. His process philosophy, positing that reality is made up of events and processes rather than static objects, may seem at odds with more traditional, commonsensical notions of reality. Consequently, the abstract nature of his ideas can present a barrier to those attempting to engage with his work. 3. Ambiguity and interpretation: Due to the complex nature of Whitehead's ideas, there tends to be significant room for interpretation regarding their meaning and implications. This can create ambiguity and even disagreement among scholars as to the exact nature of his thought, which could limit his influence since it may be challenging to establish a unified understanding of his contributions. 4. Theistic elements: Whitehead's incorporation of theistic elements into his philosophy, such as the concept of God as a unifying principle in the cosmos, might have limited his influence among more secular audiences. Some might dismiss his work as too religious or unscientific, due to the blending of metaphysics and theology in his thought. 5. Dominance of other philosophical schools: During Whitehead's time, as well as in subsequent intellectual history, some other philosophical schools have enjoyed more widespread influence and popularity. Logical positivism, analytic philosophy, and existentialism, among others, have often overshadowed Whitehead's process philosophy. As a result, his ideas could be perceived as less relevant or significant, leading to a restriction of his influence. 6. Perception of metaphysics as passé: In the 20th century, interests in philosophy shifted towards more concrete, empirical concerns, with many considering metaphysics to be outdated or unnecessary. Given that Whitehead's work is fundamentally metaphysical in nature, this change in philosophical focus might have contributed to the perceived limited influence of his ideas. In summary, Alfred North Whitehead's influence may have been restricted due to the complexity and density of his writings, abstract and counterintuitive concepts, ambiguity, theistic elements, dominance of other philosophical schools, and the declining interest in metaphysics. These factors could have combined to limit the accessibility, appreciation, and consequently, the broader influence of Whitehead's work."},{"question":"Marathon runner running towards the finish line doesn't implies that it's a 25 kilometer race for charity. This justifies what answer for what question? Q & A:","response":"Question: Can we assume that a marathon runner running towards the finish line is participating in a 25 kilometer race for charity?

Her daughter Mary The answer to this question is:","response":"Title: The Heart's Resolve Step 1: Introduce the main characters Our main characters are Sylvia and her daughter, Mary. Sylvia is a strong and determined single mother who cherishes her daughter above all else. Mary is a talented and independent young woman who has a close relationship with her mother. Step 2: Establish the setting The story takes place in a small, close-knit coastal town. The town has picturesque scenery, and the supportive community is an essential aspect of the plot. Step 3: Create a conflict A wealthy businessman wants to build a massive resort right on the coast, which will bring in unprecedented tourism and profits but will also disrupt the local community's quiet lifestyle. This project will require the acquisition of several properties, including the land on which Sylvia and Mary live. Step 4: Develop the plot As the project advances, Sylvia and Mary receive an irresistibly lucrative offer for their land. However, this would mean leaving their beloved town and the close-knit community they know and love. Sylvia is adamant about not giving up their home, but Mary, who is just starting her adult life, sees the opportunity to move to the city and pursue her dreams. The mother-daughter relationship faces strain as their desires conflict with one another. Step 5: Introduce a turning point While exploring options to save their home and community, Sylvia and Mary stumble upon a long-lost town legend, possibly containing a secret that could ultimately thwart the businessman's plans. They decide to join forces with a small group of passionate locals to uncover the truth. Step 6: Add a twist As they investigate, Sylvia and Mary find out that the wealthy businessman has a hidden personal connection to the coastal town. His intention is actually to reconnect with his roots, but his method of doing so risks destroying the very essence of what makes the town special. Step 7: Approaching the climax The group of locals, led by Sylvia and Mary, rallies the community to protest the project. As they make their voices heard, the wealthy businessman has a change of heart and becomes more sympathetic to their cause. Step 8: The climax Following an emotional confrontation between Sylvia, Mary, and the businessman, they reach an agreement. The proposed resort is scaled back, designed to incorporate and preserve the town's unique charm while still bringing some economic benefits. Step 9: Resolve the conflict and end the story The town's community remains intact, and Sylvia and Mary's bond is stronger than ever. Mary realizes that her home, community, and cherished memories with her mother are worth far more than any monetary value and decides to stay in the town, finding a way to pursue her dreams without leaving. The movie ends with a heartwarming scene where Sylvia, Mary, and the community celebrate their victory and the preservation of their beloved town. The answer to Sylvia's question is: Sylvia does not want to give up her home and the close-knit community she and her daughter Mary share. Through the story, they find that their love and understanding for each other, as well as their connection to the community, can ultimately triumph over challenges, leading to a better future for their town."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given an ambiguous question (which can be answered in more than one way).

This availability offers consumers a wide array of options, making it easier for them to find and purchase the items they need or desire. Firstly, the Internet has opened up a vast world of possibilities for consumers, enabling them to access products and services from across the globe. Websites like conrad.de offer an extensive range of items, making it easy for customers to browse and compare different products. Furthermore, the convenience of online shopping has significant appeal, as customers can place orders quickly and have their purchases delivered straight to their door. In addition to websites, catalogs still play a crucial role in the buying process. Catalogs offer customers a tangible way to browse through products and can even be more user-friendly for those who are less comfortable with online shopping. Companies often send out printed catalogs in the mail, or they may offer digital versions on their websites. Catalogs typically include product descriptions, images, and prices, making it easy for users to visualize and compare their options. Physical stores also remain a critical part of the retail landscape, as customers can visit them to obtain a hands-on experience with products before making a purchase. Brick-and-mortar stores allow consumers to assess the quality of a product, try on clothing items for fit, and even test out electronic devices for functionality. Additionally, the presence of knowledgeable sales staff can be incredibly beneficial, as they can assist customers with their inquiries and provide personalized recommendations. Aside from providing an array of purchasing options, the availability of products through online platforms, catalogs, and physical stores can also cater to different consumer preferences. Some people may prefer the convenience and speed of online shopping, while others may enjoy the tactile experience of browsing through physical catalogs. Still, others may prioritize the face-to-face interaction they receive in brick-and-mortar stores. Moreover, this wide accessibility helps to increase competition among retailers, which can potentially lead to better pricing and product variety. Companies are continually looking to improve their offerings and appeal to consumers in innovative ways.

While it does mention \\"collegiate gross-out,\\" those words are used to describe the type of comedy, not to say something negative about it. So, the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive because it is praising the comedy for being funny. The negative option is wrong because the sentence is not saying something bad or negative about the comedy."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Cant download !!!!

Before elaborating on it, it's important to clarify that the Eastern Catholic Churches are a group of self-governing Churches in full communion with the Bishop of Rome (the Pope). While they follow different liturgical traditions and church law systems, they share the same faith and recognize the Pope's authority. The sentence states that the earthly laws of these Churches were much in the same state as that of the Latin or Western Church before 1917. This could mean several things: 1. Centralization: Similar to the Western Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches were centralized under the authority of Rome. It is a common practice for the churches in communion with Rome to follow the overall model put forth by the Pope while incorporating their unique traditions and rites. The implication here is that the Pope holds the ultimate authority in both Western and Eastern Churches. 2. Similarity in Charter Laws: The phrase \\"in much the same state\\" may suggest that the Eastern Catholic Churches, like the Latin Church, followed the Roman Canon Law or a similar legislative structure. The Roman Canon Law, which was a significant fixture in the Western Church before 1917, provided a legal structure comprising matters such as governance, liturgy, teaching, and sacraments. The second part of the sentence indicates \\"much more diversity in legislation existed in the various Eastern Catholic Churches.\\" This suggests a significant difference - while the Eastern Churches did have a similar structure to the Western Church, the scope of their laws differed. Here are some factors suggested by the statement: 3. Diversity in Legislation: Unlike the Latin Church, which followed a more uniform set of laws, the Eastern Catholic Churches presented more variety in their legislation. This could down to the different cultural, historical, and sociological influences in the countries and regions these churches belong to. Unlike the Western Church's relatively uniform body of canon law, this implies a more diverse assortment of laws at work within the Eastern Catholic Churches. 4. Autonomy: The Eastern Catholic Churches, while acknowledging the Pope's spiritual and legislative authority, had a level of autonomy to create, interpret, and enforce their laws in a way that aligned with their traditions, cultures, and particular circumstances. This autonomy could be seen as a reason behind the mentioned diverse legislation. In conclusion, while the sentence you provided doesn't directly answer the question, it suggests that a major factor in Eastern Church law was a combination of central government by Rome, similarity in charter laws to the Western Church, diversity in legislation, and autonomy. It would be beneficial to conduct deeper research to provide a more comprehensive answer related to the specific laws, rulings, cultural influences, and historical events that further shaped these factors."},{"question":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air. By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood.

I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them. I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something. \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up.

To provide a detailed analysis of this phrase, it's essential to break down its components. Firstly, the term \\"self-conscious\\" typically indicates a sense of uneasiness, discomfort, or excessive concern about oneself. In the context of a movie review, this term might imply that the movie's elements, such as the plot, dialogues, or scenes, appear forced, overly cautious, or deliberately designed to draw attention. This may cause viewers to lose immersion and feel disconnected from the film's overall experience. Secondly, the word \\"seams\\" suggests the connections or bindings that hold together different elements or components. In terms of a movie, seams might refer to the narrative structure, transitions between scenes, or the way that multiple storylines or characters interconnect. When used negatively, it might imply that these connections are weak, disjointed, or too obvious. Thus, instead of seamlessly creating a coherent story, the film may struggle to maintain a smooth and cohesive flow, which can be an undesirable quality. In conclusion, based on the analysis of the terms \\"self-conscious\\" and \\"seams,\\" this movie review sentence leans towards a negative tone. The phrase suggests that the film in question suffers from a disjointed or forced narrative and that its elements do not merge well to create an engaging and immersive cinematic experience. However, it is worth noting that without more context, the ultimate interpretation of this sentence may vary."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

It searches for tiny particles which would improve scientists' understanding of dark matter. Dark matter is the invisible material thought to make up 95% of the universe. Dark matter has yet to be detected directly by scientists and has so far been observed only by its effects on gravity, which can be seen in the rotation of galaxies and the way light bends as it travels through space. The upgrade increases the chances of the detector identifying sub-atomic particles called Wimps - weakly interacting massive particles - which scientists believe are the main component of dark matter. A team of physicists, including scientists at Edinburgh University, have made Lux's ability to identify the lightest form of Wimps about 20 times more sensitive. This has allowed them to study data collected during Lux's initial run in 2013 which previously had to be ignored. Wimps are difficult to spot because they collide with normal matter only rarely, and their faint signals are drowned out by cosmic radiation from space. Professor Alex Murphy, of Edinburgh University's school of physics and astronomy, said: \\"Since Lux's first run, we have developed several new calibration techniques and methods of analysis. We are now able to look for tell-tale signs of Wimps in data we previously had to ignore, increasing our chances of detecting dark matter.\\" Lux is housed deep underground where few cosmic rays can penetrate, and consists of a tank of liquid xenon surrounded by sensitive light detectors. It is designed to spot collisions between Wimps and xenon atoms inside the detector. Following a collision, the xenon atom emits a tiny flash of light, which is spotted by Lux's light sensors. The upgrade was supported by the US Department for Energy and the National Science Foundation. The Lux scientific collaborative involves 19 institutions in Europe and the US. What was that article about?","response":"The article discusses the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) detector, a high-tech instrument located deep within a former mine in South Dakota, USA, a mile below the ground. This device is dedicated to investigating small particles to enhance scientists' comprehension of dark matter. Dark matter, an invisible substance believed to make up 95% of the universe, has not been directly detected yet. Currently, it has only been identified through its gravitational influence, such as the rotation of galaxies and the bending of light as it traverses space. This particular report emphasizes an upgrade to the LUX detector that elevates its ability to identify sub-atomic particles, defined as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Scientists posit that these particles constitute the majority of dark matter. With improved capabilities, LUX is now approximately 20 times more sensitive when it comes to identifying the lighter variants of WIMPs. This upgrade has enabled the LUX team to revisit and scrutinize data collected from its 2013 initial run that were initially disregarded. The rarity of WIMPs' collisions with regular matter, along with the overwhelming cosmic radiation, makes detecting these elusive particles an incredibly challenging task. However, LUX is strategically situated far underground, making it less susceptible to cosmic rays. The detector consists of a container filled with liquid xenon, which is surrounded by sensitive light detectors. This setup is devised to observe any collisions between xenon atoms and WIMPs. When a collision occurs, the xenon atom emits a minuscule flash of light, which the LUX's light sensors record. Professor Alex Murphy from Edinburgh University's School of Physics and Astronomy praised the development, commenting that through the use of new calibration techniques and analytical methods, they have become better situated to seek the elusive indicators of WIMPs in the previously discarded data. Thus, the chances of detecting dark matter are increased. The US Department for Energy and the National Science Foundation financially backed the upgrade of LUX. Moreover, this collaborative endeavor involves 19 academic institutions from the United States and Europe, making the effort wholly international and interdisciplinary."},{"question":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: Sentence A","response":"Question: What is a potential response to a client's inquiry about the progress of their project, where the team has completed all the predetermined tasks according to schedule?

Negative Yelp Review: Title: Disappointing Experience at The Sea Breeze Café Rating: ⭐️ I rarely take the time to write Yelp reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience at The Sea Breeze Café, hoping to save others from a similarly disappointing experience. Upon entering the restaurant, my wife and I were greeted by a faint musty smell, which should have been our first red flag. However, we decided to give the place a chance since we'd heard great things from a couple of friends. The ambience was underwhelming - tired décor, sticky tabletops, and dim lighting with flickering bulbs that seemed to be begging to be replaced. Even more discouraging was the slow and inattentive service. It took quite a while for someone to approach us and hand out the menus, despite the restaurant being less than half full. Our server seemed disinterested and impatient, barely giving us time to choose our dishes. I eventually settled for the shrimp scampi, while my wife opted for the clam chowder and the blackened salmon entree. The food took an unreasonable amount of time to be served, leaving us questioning whether the kitchen staff had forgotten us or if they were simply cooking the fish themselves! And when it did arrive, the disappointment continued. The shrimp in my scampi was overcooked and rubbery, the pasta was swimming in a pool of bland, oily garlic butter, and the garnish looked like it had seen better days. Reaching for the clam chowder with high hopes, the expression on my wife's face quickly changed from anticipation to disbelief, as the chowder tasted more like canned cream of mushroom soup than the indulgent seafood bisque we were craving. Her blackened salmon was dry and lacked the flavorful char that usually accompanies blackened dishes. Out of sheer hunger and not wanting to cause a scene, we did our best to finish our meals, though we were far from satisfied. At that point, we decided to skip dessert and opted to leave as soon as possible. Trying to settle the bill was its own separate ordeal. Our server finally reappeared after what felt like a lifetime, not even bothering to inquire about our experience. In truth, it was probably for the best, as I wasn't keen to discuss the dismal meal we'd just endured. All in all, I cannot recommend The Sea Breeze Café. An evening that should have been a delightful and relaxing dining experience turned out to be quite the opposite, and I'm left with nothing more than regret and a lingering sense of dissatisfaction with my choice of restaurant."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"The best app ever Amazing\\" Answer:","response":"Answer: 5"},{"question":"By.

Mr Buffett, 83, donated about 21.73million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway, the so-called Sage of Omaha's investment vehicle, a regulatory filing shows. About 16.6million shares, worth more than 2.1billion, went to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on education, health and poverty problems. Scroll down for video. Cool move: Warren Buffett eats an ice lolly. He has just donated nearly 3billion to charitable foundations. The rest went to four family charities, including a foundation named for his late first wife Susan and foundations for his children Howard, Peter and Susan. The 2.8billion is the most Buffett has donated to these charities, reflecting Berkshire's near-record share price, since he began making annual gifts in 2006. Mr Buffett still controls nearly 20 per cent of Berkshire's stock, which made him worth 65.8billion on Monday, the day the donation was made, according to Forbes magazine. Only Mexico telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim and Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and Berkshire director, were worth more, Forbes said. Thanks: Bill Gates, co-founder and co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which received shares in Berkshire Hathaway worth more than 2billion to invest in its charitable causes. Berkshire has more than 80 operating businesses and ended March with more than 146billion of stock and bond investments. Mr Buffett has run the Omaha, Nebraska-based company since 1965.

A great number of ecclesiastical buildings remain from this period, of which even the smallest are often structures of architectural distinction while many of the larger churches are considered priceless works of art and are listed with UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. For this reason a study of Gothic architecture is largely a study of cathedrals and churches. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why are larger cathedrals and churches associated with the Gothic style?","response":"Larger cathedrals and churches are associated with the Gothic style for several reasons: 1. Innovative architectural techniques: Gothic architecture introduced several innovations that allowed for the creation of taller and more spacious buildings. These innovations included the use of pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses. These features enabled builders to construct larger and more stable cathedrals and churches, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with previous architectural styles. 2. Expression of religious devotion: Gothic architecture emerged during the Middle Ages, a time when Christian faith was essential to everyday life. The construction of large cathedrals and churches was often seen as a way to demonstrate devotion to God. The grandiosity and attention to detail in these buildings were believed to reflect the glory and magnificence of the divine. 3. Pilgrimage and community centers: Cathedrals and churches served not only as places of worship but also as pilgrimage sites and community centers. Building larger structures made it possible to accommodate more worshipers, pilgrims, and local residents, further showcasing the religious and social importance of these edifices. 4. Artistic and cultural significance: Gothic architecture is characterized by its ornate design and artistic elements, such as stained glass windows, sculptures, and intricate carvings. Larger cathedrals and churches provided a canvas for artists and craftsmen to showcase their skills, resulting in breathtaking works of art that have endured for centuries. 5. Preserved examples and UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Many large Gothic cathedrals and churches have been well-preserved over time or reconstructed after damage. As a result, these buildings stand as a testament to the architectural achievements of the Gothic period. UNESCO has recognized several of these structures as World Heritage Sites, highlighting their cultural and historical importance and reinforcing the connection between the Gothic style and larger cathedrals and churches."},{"question":"Meanwhile, it turns out that Communism is like a hydra which springs back to life in various parts of the world and that there are those who defend it even here in this Chamber.

The controls for this train set allow him to make it go faster or slower and it even has a rail switch to make it travel on different tracks branching off to the left or right. and a hint : Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. Please answer this question : Will making the train switch to a different track be considered acceleration, yes or no. Answer:","response":"Yes, making the train switch to a different track will be considered as acceleration. This is because acceleration is not only related to changes in speed, but also to changes in direction. In the given situation, when Johnny makes the train switch to a different track using the rail switch, there will be a change in the direction of motion of the train. The train will move from its original path to the left or right track, and this change in direction is considered acceleration. Regardless of the train's speed remaining constant, the fact that its direction of motion has changed means that it has experienced acceleration. To further understand this, recall that both velocity and acceleration are vector quantities. Vector quantities have both magnitude (size) and direction. While people commonly associate acceleration with an increase or decrease in speed, it is important to remember that any change in the velocity vector, whether it be speed or direction, results in acceleration. In this context, if the toy train turns left or right to switch tracks, it experiences acceleration due to the change in direction, even if its speed remains constant. On the other hand, if the train increases or decreases its speed while traveling on the same track, it will still be undergoing acceleration or deceleration because its speed (and therefore the magnitude of its velocity vector) is changing. To sum up, making the train switch to a different track will be considered acceleration, even if the train's speed does not change, as acceleration encompasses changes in both speed and direction of a moving object."},{"question":"This is a test of commonsense with single/multi-choices.

It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city.

The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - Operation Market Garden (1725 September 1944) was an unsuccessful Allied military operation, fought in the Netherlands and Germany in the Second World War. The operation was split into two sub-operations: - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Koninklijk or Koninklijke (Dutch for \\"Royal\\") is an honorary title given to certain companies and non-profit organizations in Belgium and the Netherlands, by the monarchs of each country. It was first introduced by Louis Bonaparte in 1807, then King of the Netherlands, who awarded the title to cultural associations. Companies awarded with the title may opt to use the English equivalent 'Royal' instead. It is comparable with the Royal Warrant in the UK. - Nuenen , Gerwen en Nederwetten ( pronunciation ) is a municipality consisting of the larger village of Nuenen and two adjacent smaller ones . It is located in the province of Noord - Brabant , about 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) east of Eindhoven , the fifth largest city in the Netherlands .

They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - Nuenen is a town in the municipality of Nuenen, Gerwen en Nederwetten in the Netherlands. From 1883 to 1885, Vincent van Gogh lived and worked in Nuenen. In 1944, the town was a battle scene during Operation Market Garden. The local dialect is called Peellands. In 2009, Nuenen had a population of 22,437. - Gerard Leonardo Frederik Philips (9 October 1858 26 January 1942) was a Dutch industrialist, co-founder (with his father Frederik Philips) of the Philips Company as a family business in 1891. Gerard and his younger brother Anton Philips changed the business to a corporation by founding in 1912 the NV Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken. As the first CEO of the Philips corporation, Gerard laid with Anton the base for the later Philips multinational.

Passage:Specimens of Lambertia formosa were collected by botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander during Lieutenant James Cook's landing at Botany Bay between April and May in 1770. These are thought to have been obtained from vegetation currently known as the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub that occurs in sandy areas near present-day La Perouse. The shrub was first described in 1798 by English botanist James Edward Smith who concurrently erected the new genus Lambertia, the name honouring English botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. The specific name formosa is the Latin adjective for 'handsome'. English plantsman Henry Charles Andrews wrote in 1799, \\"Of all the plants yet introduced from New Holland, that have hitherto flowered with us, this unquestionably takes the lead for beauty, considering the plant altogether\\", although his countryman Joseph Knight in his 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae added that the species name \\"applies only to the flowers, the foliage being generally of a sickly hue\\". French botanist Michel Gandoger described specimens collected at Hornsby and Port Jackson as Lambertia proxima, and material sent to him by plant collector Charles Walter as L. barbata in 1919; these turned out to be L. formosa. Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants, almost all of which turned out to be species already described.

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Now, I have a new situation: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. Answer this question please: Which farmer helped to stabilize the soil more? A:","response":"Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, has helped to stabilize the soil more. Gary's use of agroforestry practices and cover crops provides numerous benefits to soil health and stability. By implementing agroforestry, he has integrated trees, shrubs, and other vegetation, helping to diversify the agricultural system while protecting the depleted soil. Here are the key reasons why Gary's soil is more stable than Joe's: 1. Soil protection - Cover crops provide a protective layer on the soil surface that helps minimize the impact of raindrops, which can cause soil erosion and the washing away of valuable nutrients. This layer also reduces the speed at which water flows over the surface, reducing the chances of soil being carried away. 2. Improved soil structure and organic matter - The roots of cover crops help to create pore spaces in the soil, improving water infiltration and reducing surface runoff. Additionally, when cover crops die and decompose, they contribute organic matter to the soil, further improving its structure, water-holding capacity, and nutrient storage. 3. Enhanced nutrient uptake - Agroforestry systems, particularly those that include leguminous cover crops and nitrogen-fixing trees, provide a natural source of nitrogen to the soil. This additional nitrogen, along with other nutrients from decomposing plant material, can help reduce nutrient loss into streams, keeping the nutrients in the soil for use by crops. 4. Increased biodiversity - By implementing agroforestry practices, Gary has increased the diversity of plant species in his fields, creating a more resilient ecosystem that is less susceptible to pests, diseases, and other disturbances. This increased biodiversity supports a healthy soil food web, which ultimately contributes to overall soil stability. In contrast, Joe's farm, which has depleted soil and lacks the implementation of cover crops or agroforestry practices, is more susceptible to soil erosion and nutrient runoff. As a result, Joe's soil is less stable and less able to support sustainable agriculture. In conclusion, between the two farmers, it is Gary who has helped to stabilize the soil more through his adoption of agroforestry practices and growing cover crops. These practices have resulted in improved soil structure, increased nutrient availability, and reduced soil erosion, leading to a more stable and resilient agricultural system."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy. - Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a soft gray Group 2 alkaline earth metal, fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. The ion Ca is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved ion in seawater by both molarity and mass, after sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate. Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature. Calcium is produced in supernova nucleosynthesis. - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\". - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust. - Sodium is a chemical element with symbol Na (from Latin \\"natrium\\") and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged atomthe Na cation. Its only stable isotope is Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans. - The alkaline earth metals are six chemical elements in column (group) 2 of the Periodic table. They are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). They have very similar properties: they are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - The chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl. It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents. Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells. Less frequently, the word \\"chloride\\" may also form part of the \\"common\\" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded. For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent CCl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion. - Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all Group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure. - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers. - Hijiki ( , or hijiki ) ( Sargassum fusiforme , syn .

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

Thus, the relationship between Daniel Purcell and Baroque music is that he was a composer actively creating and influencing the musical landscape during that period."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A woman is having some trouble with her eyes, so she goes to see the doctor.

He has repeated that phrase more than once, and my mind continually plays it over like a voice recording. I met him about three years ago. After knowing me for six months, he told me about his struggles with depression . Sadness was not the only feeling that came over me; I was shocked. He seemed so outgoing and happy all the time. I soon learned that he was hurt physically and mentally as a young child, causing him to have the thought of killing himself. He refuses to talk to others about his depression because he now distrusts adults, especially those in his family. However, he feels as if I understand him and that I know the right words to speak. Therefore, when it comes to helping him, convenience is not in my vocabulary. It does not matter where I am or what I am doing, for he always comes first. Many students at his school laugh at him when they notice scars on his arms from cutting. As he sees it, other kids have every right to make fun of him. But no one holds such a right, so I encourage him to ignore the heartless kids who treat him badly. When he feels the weight of judging eyes or hateful voices, I always remind him that I care about him unconditionally. Just hearing me say I will always be his best friend seems to give him the safety he needs to keep on going. My best friend once told me that if he had not had me, he would not be alive. He said that my encouraging words helped him not to take his life. Our friendship has taught me that a single kind word can influence someones life.

Tye withdraws money from two banks: Bank A and Bank B. He withdraws 300 from each bank. 2. Tye wants all the money in 20 bills. 3. To determine the number of 20 bills Tye receives, we'll first add up the total amount of money he has withdrawn. Total withdrawal: 300 (Bank A) + 300 (Bank B) = 600 4. Now, we'll divide the total withdrawal by the denomination of the bills Tye wants, which is 20. Number of 20 bills: 600 / 20 = 30 So, Tye would receive 30 twenty-dollar bills after withdrawing 300 from each bank."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

The film stars Adam Brody, Kristen Bell, Zoe Kazan, Mía Maestro, Jennifer Morrison and Emily Watson. The film was released on June 26, 2013, by Leeden Media. Hypothesis: Some Girl(s) took less than a year to film.","response":"Based on the provided context, we cannot draw the stated hypothesis that the film Some Girl(s) took less than a year to film. The context provides information about the film's title, its director, writer, main stars, and the release date. However, it does not specify any details on the duration of filming, production time, pre-production or post-production duration. The production time for any film involves various stages including, but not limited to, script development, casting, principal photography, and finally, post-production works such as editing, sound, and special effects. Considering the information available, we can infer that the film is a comedy and that it was released in 2013 by Leeden Media. It is based on a play of the same name, which suggests that the story was previously developed, potentially affecting the timeline of production, but such inference does not allow for the assumption of the exact film production duration. Further, we know the names of some of the actors involved, including Adam Brody, Kristen Bell, Zoe Kazan, Mía Maestro, Jennifer Morrison, and Emily Watson. However, the inclusion of these details, while providing insight into the film's casting, does not provide any direct or indirect clues about the length of the filming process. To draw a hypothesis about the time it took to film Some Girl(s), we would need more specific information regarding the onset production start date, any delays, or general information on how long the production process took. Without such information, any hypothesis about the production timeline would be pure conjecture. Therefore, based on the given context, the hypothesis that Some Girl(s) took less than a year to film cannot be confirmed or refuted."},{"question":"Translate to Russian: The international team of 100 instructors gives classes in 16 languages, including Russian.","response":"Международная команда из 100 инструкторов проводит уроки на 16 языках, включая русский.

Article: It seems that all your friends' names on MSN have added a little green \\"I'm\\" symbol overnight. If you ask what is going on, someone will tell you it's a charity activity. Though this charity program has not yet officially begun for Chinese users, this little green symbol has proven popular among Chinese Windows Live Messenger users. Windows Live Messenger's official blog announced on March 1 that Microsoft was beginning an \\"I'm\\" program in the United States. Every time someone starts a conversation using \\"I'm\\", Microsoft shares a part of the program's advertising income with nine organizations devoted to social causes. With every instant message a user sends, it helps deal with things one feels most interested in, including poverty, child protection, disease and worsening environment. One only has to add a certain code next to one's name for the organization one would like to support. \\"*red'u\\" is for the American Red Cross, \\"*bgca\\" is for Boys & Girls Clubs of America and \\"*unicef\\" stands for the American branch of UNICEF. After a Chinese blogger named \\"hung\\" introduced this program on his blog on March 2, \\"I'm\\" entered the Internet in China with no actual support from Microsoft. Beijing-based Youth Weekend reported that famous IT blogger Keso regarded this program's rapid spread as a successful virus marketing case. He thinks that the success of the \\"I'm\\" program is because it's spread by users without being a bother to others.

The 23-minute film begins with a section which visually introduces the subject, Nice, France. Then we see scenes of the idle rich along the Nice coast and enjoying spectator sports. Next follows visions of the common man, including street scenes, laundry being hung, and industrial images. The contrast of these two \\"worlds\\" is followed by an exuberant street carnivale, where social conventions are cast aside and common people give in to their passions. Finally, a near-caricature of the wealthy (a single crevassed face of a upper class woman) is transposed with a carnival mask, overturned.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Vinod is sceptical about this, but accepts when Raja tells them of his tragic childhood and comes to regard Sudha as a maternal figure. Finally, Vinod decides to help Raja by sending him to Bangalore to complete his education and become a journalist. During frequent meetings with Vinod and Sudha, Raja befriends Geeta (Rati Agnihotri), an aspiring journalist and an assistant in Vinod's paper, and they fall in love. During his investigations, Vinod finds that S.K. Vardhan (Amrish Puri), a wealthy and respected man in the society, is behind many malpractices. Vinod starts exposing S.K's illicit business of drug-trafficking and selling hooch. Initially, S.K. tries to buy Vinod's silence by bribing him, but when Vinod decides to stand up to S.K., the latter inflicts misery on Vinod by having him thrown out of his rented house via the landlord. That very night, Vinod's newspaper office is burnt down by S.K.'s men. Helpless, and on the streets, tragedy strikes Vinod and Sudha further when Sudha, who is ailing, dies on the road, leaving Vinod distraught and heartbroken. A disillusioned Vinod realizes that S.K. will always trump him, since people also support him. Instead of trying to expose S.K., Vinod now decides to follow S.K's footsteps in order to destroy him. Vinod, in association with Kishorilal (Saeed Jaffrey), starts producing illicit hooch and doing other illegal businesses to earn lots of money - the thing, Vinod retrospectively feels, he lacked, and the shortage of which led to the tragedies in his life.

Answer:","response":"\\"Beyond the Mashaal: A Quest for Justice\\" The title \\"Beyond the Mashaal: A Quest for Justice\\" captures the essence of the movie's plot – the struggle and transformation of Vinod, the founding editor of \\"Mashaal\\" newspaper, as he exposes the dark underbelly of society and confronts adversities brought upon by S.K. Vardhan, a malicious and powerful man. The title highlights the importance of the newspaper, Mashaal, as a beacon of truth and integrity and the journey it takes to bring about justice. The word \\"Mashaal\\" holds significance as it means \\"torch\\" in Hindi, symbolizing the newspaper's role in shedding light on the misdeeds and injustices within society. The title also depicts the protagonist, Vinod Kumar, whose life goes \\"beyond\\" the boundaries of the Mashaal to exact retribution upon the villainous S.K. Vardhan. \\"Beyond\\" is used to signify Vinod's transformation as he faces numerous challenges and the death of his wife Sudha, leading him to temporarily abandon his principles and turn to illicit activities in an attempt to bring down S.K. Vardhan. The term \\"Quest for Justice\\" highlights Vinod's ultimate goal to hold S.K. Vardhan accountable for his actions, no matter the personal cost or consequences Vinod may face. Furthermore, the title also emphasizes the various relationships and characters that evolve and intertwine throughout the story, such as the connection between Vinod's wife, Sudha, and the vagabond Raja, who later becomes a successful journalist, and the romance between Raja and Geeta, an aspiring journalist working at Vinod's paper. These relationships serve to underscore the theme of hope, redemption, and resilience, adding complexity and depth to the story.

Passage:After succeeding to his family titles in 1899 he inherited further estates in 1901, including property in Marylebone, London and earned the title of 'Britain's wealthiest bachelor'. His family's wealth was initially derived from slavery and sugar estates in Jamaica, primarily Montpelier, Jamaica. He took a lease on Audley End House, Essex which had once belonged to his ancestors, in 1904 but reportedly never felt settled there. The artist Auguste Rodin created a bust of Lord Howard de Walden in 1906 which is held in the collection kept at the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia. In 1911, in preparation for his marriage, he leased Chirk Castle, Denbighshire, which became his main residence after WWI until 1946, and where he learned the Welsh language; he later served as president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales from 1931 to 1945.","response":"In order to answer the question \\"How many slaves were living in Jamaica the year Rodin created his bust of Lord Howard de Walden?\\", we need to determine the year the bust was created and then find information about the number of slaves living in Jamaica at that time.

No script, just making it up as he went along. When I watched it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). At first I thought I'd hooked it up wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better, you know. But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it. As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene. A bit of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. But alas, no. If you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap, throw in some gratuitous nudity. Worked for Roger Corman.

I was really disappointed. This was my Birthday dinner. We used the Living Social Coupon. Went here because a friend had suggested it. To each his own, I guess. We had.. Caprese Salad. - Very bland tomatoes, in fact one was mushy and a bad texture. There was No salt on the table, which killed this dish completely. Shrimp Cocktail - Shrimp were pretty tasteless, and although they had some sauces, there was no where near enough sauce for the amount of shrimp Tomato Soup - Was good, but acidic, it needed a cream to break the acidity. Bone-in Rib Eye - Way too fatty and tough. Garlic Mashed - Good, esp with the Veal DemiGlace Lobster Mac and Cheese - Good, very fishy flavor, if you like that. it was ok to me. I have had This in other restaurants where it was not \\"lobster\\" enough. This was not the case here. The experience: First, a different waiter than ours was retrieving plates near our table and dropped a plate on the floor, right next to us, glass shattered everywhere. Hitting mine and my wife's bare feet and legs (We had Sandals on) The waiter didn't ask if we were ok, didn't apologize, he just acted as if nothing happened. I was also worried that shards of glass maybe made it on our appetizer plates, because it was that explosive, but they did NOTHING about it. My wife and I BOTH visibly checked our feet and legs and I had a knick on my leg from glass, the waiter saw us visually inspecting our feet and still said nothing. Next, when I ordered the steak, Bone-in Rib eye, I asked for Red Wine Reduction sauce and Herb Butter. - When my steak was delivered, they forgot the Red Wine Reduction completely, and gave me what looked like Herb Butter, but chunkier. Without testing it, I dolloped it on my steak and began spreading it, and noticed obvious Bleu Cheese chunks. I tasted it and it was for SURE Blue Cheese, within the butter. I did not order this of course, but I know Bleu Cheese for sure. The waiter came back and I told him of the mistake, and he apologized, but also said they don't even have a Bleu cheese Butter, so he doesn't know how this happened. He was good about it, but I did feel like they were calling me a bit of a lier as they mentioned a few times that they dont have Bleu cheese butter, and dont know that happened. I cook... I know Blue cheese, AND, others on my table got the herb butter and it was completely different. They did bring me a a new steak, BUT at that point I was eating after the rest of my party, and it was awkward. To top it off, I was Up to that point the best thing was the Red Wine Reduction, when they did bring it with my new steak. Which is sad They did bring a chocolate cake for my birthday and that was the star of the night for sure. Too bad the actual food was no good. The waiter was good and attentive, so I will give him kuddos for that.","response":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative.

The first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s. Rational drug discovery from plants started particularly with the isolation of morphine, analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium, by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner, who named the compound after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. Multinational corporations including Merck, Hoffman-La Roche, Burroughs-Wellcome (now part of Glaxo Smith Kline), Abbott Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s. By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Morphine was named after what Greek god?","response":"Morphine was named after the Greek god Morpheus.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Identify key elements of the given sentence The given sentence states, \\"A man is encouraging a small white dog to stand on its hind legs in a dog show.\\" The key elements include a man, a small white dog, standing on hind legs, and a dog show. Step 2: Understand the context The context involves a man trying to get a dog to perform an action (standing on its hind legs) within the setting of a dog show. A dog show typically involves pets demonstrating skills or performing tricks, often with the assistance of their owners or handlers. Step 3: Analyze the statement to determine its truth The statement to evaluate is \\"A man is performing with his dog.\\" - A man is present in the situation. - The man is actively involved in the performance by encouraging the dog. - The dog is the focus of the performance, standing on hind legs. - The act of encouraging the dog to stand on its hind legs suggests that the dog is most likely his dog, or at the very least, he is responsible for it during the performance.

It could be possible that they have participated in more contests or implemented new ways to win since that statement was made, but we are not given any additional context or data. 3. The hypothesis contradicts what is stated in the premise since the premise says the person hasn't won anything, and the hypothesis claims that they have.

In case A, did the scientist more likely of less likely commit a fraud than the scientist in case B? John works for the NSF. He has two research proposals in front of him, case A and case B. Both are looking for further funding. Case A research has been replicated by other researchers, but case B research could not be replicated by others. He needs to decide which research should get further funding. Hint: Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research. However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results.

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who is the hairdresser? Options: - The narrator's mother - The narrator's boss - The narrator's best friend - not enough information Answer:","response":"- Not enough information"},{"question":"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice premiered at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on March 19, 2016, and was released in the United States on March 25, 2016 in 2D, Real D 3D, IMAX 3D, IMAX, 4DX, premium large formats, and 70 mm prints by Warner Bros.

In the given scenario, there is a group of young people. While it could be possible that the term \\"young people\\" might refer to \\"kids,\\" there's no specific age range mentioned. Young people could also include teenagers or young adults. Therefore, we cannot clearly determine that kids are present in the situation without further context. Furthermore, the young people are focusing their attention on one man in the middle of a circle. This implies that the group of young people is arranged around the man in a circular formation. However, it doesn't specifically mention that the young people themselves are forming a complete circle. They could be clustered around the man, or they could be positioned in a semi-circle or an incomplete circular formation. Finally, the word \\"gathered\\" in the phrase \\"A circle of kids are gathered\\" suggests that the young people have come together for a specific purpose. Although the initial statement provides a description of the spatial arrangement of the group, it doesn't provide any information about the purpose, intent, or reason behind them focusing their attention on the man. In conclusion, while it is possible that \\"A circle of kids are gathered,\\" based on the given statement, we cannot conclusively confirm this without additional context and information."},{"question":"Answer based on context: New Caledonia is a major source for nickel and contains roughly 10% of the worlds known nickel supply.

He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will increase the size of their muscles less? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","response":"Given the information provided, Robert will increase the size of his muscles less compared to Michael. This is because Robert continues being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months, whereas Michael has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby and exercises with weights several times a week.

Your task is to summarize them. Input: The White House declined to comment on the criticism or on whether Mr. Obama has settled on him for the job. Administration officials said Mr. Obama would like to announce at least part of his second-term national security team this week. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, is viewed as a lock for secretary of state, while the choice for director of the Central Intelligence Agency has narrowed to two candidates — Michael J. Morell, the agency’s acting director, and John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s counterterrorism adviser. Administration officials noted that there were other candidates for the Pentagon, including Michèle A. Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense, and Ashton B. Carter, the current deputy secretary at the Pentagon. Mr. Hagel, a Vietnam veteran who left the Senate in 2009 and now teaches at Georgetown University, declined to comment. For the White House, it is the second time a candidate’s record has come under fire even before a nomination was announced. Last week, Susan E. Rice, the ambassador the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after coming under weeks of withering assault by Republicans for statements she made after the deadly assault on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. In the wake of Ms. Rice’s withdrawal, there have also been questions about whether Mr. Obama’s proposed national security team would lack diversity. None of Mr. Hagel’s former Senate colleagues has come out against his candidacy. But on Tuesday, several Republicans predicted that he would face some blunt questions if nominated. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “I am concerned about some of his statements on Iran and Hamas and Israel,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said in an interview with Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper. “I’m sure that those issues will be explored in the nomination hearing, should he be nominated.” Mr. Hagel is a friend and “was a fine senator,” added Ms. Collins, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, which will consider the nomination of a defense secretary to succeed Leon E. Panetta. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

View all New York Times newsletters. Some officials on Capitol Hill predicted that if nominated, Mr. Hagel, 66, would not face anywhere near the opposition that scuttled Ms. Rice’s candidacy. He remains popular among his former colleagues. But the steady drumbeat of criticism from Jewish and other pro-Israel groups is a problem for the White House and Mr. Hagel, who as defense secretary would have to engage regularly with Israeli leaders on American military aid and the Iranian nuclear threat. “There is a very systematic effort going on, and these things can have an impact,” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the executive director of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group, which defends Mr. Hagel. “It is simply beyond disturbing to think that somebody of Chuck Hagel’s stature and significant record of national service is being slandered in this way,” Mr. Ben-Ami said. The criticism of Mr. Hagel is on two levels. The first is his voting record, which some analysts say has been soft on groups like Hezbollah and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He voted against designating the Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, they said, and refused to demand that the European Union designate Hezbollah a terrorist group. “It is a matter of fact that a record like that is well outside the mainstream of both Democratic and Republican positions on such issues,” said Josh Block, the chief executive of the Israel Project, a pro-Israel educational group. The second set of criticism centers on an interview Mr. Hagel gave in 2006 to Aaron David Miller, a longtime American diplomat, for a book he wrote on the Middle East peace process, “The Much Too Promised Land.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Speaking of groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which advocates for Israel, Mr. Hagel said, “The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here.” Critics faulted both his implication that lawmakers are bullied and his use of the phrase “Jewish” rather than “Israel,” suggesting that all advocates for Israel are Jewish. Senators from both parties have expressed discomfort with his choice of words. In the interview, Mr. Hagel noted, “I’m a United States senator, not an Israeli senator.” While he said he supported Israel, “my first interest is I take an oath of office to the Constitution of the United States. Not to a president. Not a party. Not to Israel.” Mr. Miller, now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that while Mr. Hagel’s past positions on Iran sanctions, Hamas and Hezbollah differed from the administration’s policies, it did not matter much since, as defense secretary, he would not be formulating policy in the Middle East. “His brief will concentrate on when to project American military might,” Mr. Miller said, “and here his caution and experience in the Vietnam years coincide with where the president is.” Based on talks with Mr. Hagel, Mr. Miller said he concluded that the former senator “believes in a special relationship with Israel, but not an exclusive one.” “There should not be a litmus test of whether he is pro-Israel enough,” Mr. Miller said. “He is just independent enough to recognize that there are moments when U.S.-Israel interests don’t always align.” ||||| Prejudice—like cooking, wine-tasting and other consummations—has an olfactory element. When Chuck Hagel, the former GOP senator from Nebraska who is now a front-runner to be the next secretary of Defense, carries on about how \\"the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,\\" the odor is especially ripe. Ripe because a \\"Jewish lobby,\\" as far as I'm aware, doesn't exist. No lesser authorities on the subject than John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, authors of \\"The Israel Lobby,\\" have insisted the term Jewish lobby is \\"inaccurate and misleading, both because the [Israel] lobby includes non-Jews like Christian Zionists and because many Jewish Americans do not support the hard-line policies favored by its most powerful elements.\\" Ripe because, whatever other political pressures Mr. Hagel might have had to endure during his years representing the Cornhusker state, winning over the state's Jewish voters—there are an estimated 6,100 Jewish Nebraskans in a state of 1.8 million people—was probably not a major political concern for Mr. Hagel compared to, say, the ethanol lobby. Enlarge Image Close Reuters A United States senator, not an Israeli one. In case there was any doubt. Ripe because the word \\"intimidates\\" ascribes to the so-called Jewish lobby powers that are at once vast, invisible and malevolent; and because it suggests that legislators who adopt positions friendly to that lobby are doing so not from political conviction but out of personal fear. Just what does that Jewish Lobby have on them? Ripe, finally, because Mr. Hagel's Jewish lobby remark was well in keeping with the broader pattern of his thinking. \\"I'm a United States Senator, not an Israeli Senator,\\" Mr. Hagel told retired U.S. diplomat Aaron David Miller in 2006. \\"I'm a United States Senator. I support Israel. But my first interest is I take an oath of office to the Constitution of the United States. Not to a president. Not a party. Not to Israel. If I go run for Senate in Israel, I'll do that.\\" Read these staccato utterances again to better appreciate their insipid and insinuating qualities, all combining to cast the usual slur on Jewish-Americans: Dual loyalty. Nobody questions Mr. Hagel's loyalty. He is only making those assertions to question the loyalty of others. Still, Mr. Hagel managed to say \\"I support Israel.\\" This is the sort of thing one often hears from people who treat Israel as the Mideast equivalent of a neighborhood drunk who, for his own good, needs to be put in the clink to sober him up. In 2002, a year in which 457 Israelis were killed in terrorist attacks (a figure proportionately equivalent to more than 20,000 fatalities in the U.S., or seven 9/11s), Mr. Hagel weighed in with the advice that \\"Israel must take steps to show its commitment to peace.\\" This was two years after Yasser Arafat had been offered a state by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David. In 2006, Mr. Hagel described Israel's war against Hezbollah as \\"the systematic destruction of an American friend, the country and people of Lebanon.\\" He later refused to sign a letter calling on the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. In 2007, he voted against designating Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization, and also urged President Bush to open \\"direct, unconditional\\" talks with Iran to create \\"a historic new dynamic in U.S.-Iran relations.\\" In 2009, Mr. Hagel urged the Obama administration to open direct talks with Hamas. In fairness to Mr. Hagel, all these positions emerge from his belief in the power of diplomatic engagement and talking with adversaries. The record of that kind of engagement—in 2008, Mr. Hagel and John Kerry co-authored an op-ed in this newspaper titled \\"It's Time to Talk to Syria\\"—hasn't been stellar, but at least it was borne of earnest motives. Yet it's worth noting that while Mr. Hagel is eager to engage the world's rogues without preconditions, his attitude toward Israel tends, at best, to the paternalistic. \\"The United States and Israel must understand that it is not in their long-term interests to allow themselves to become isolated in the Middle East and the world,\\" he said in a 2006 Senate speech. It's a political Deep Thought worthy of Saturday Night Live's Jack Handey. Does Mr. Hagel reckon any other nation to be quite so blind to its own supposed self-interest as Israel? Now President Obama may nominate Mr. Hagel to take Leon Panetta's place at the Pentagon. As a purely score-settling matter, I almost hope he does. It would confirm a point I made in a column earlier this year, which is that Mr. Obama is not a friend of Israel. Perhaps the 63% of Jewish-Americans who cast their votes for Mr. Obama last month might belatedly take notice. Alternatively, maybe some of these voters could speak up now, before a nomination is announced, about the insult that a Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel would be. Jewish Democrats like to fancy their voice carries weight in their party. The prospect of this nomination is their chance to prove it.

Here is a step-by-step plan to achieve this goal: 1. Research: Before planning the escape, it is crucial to understand the geography, possible routes, and the legal implications of unauthorized flying. I would research flight restrictions over Germany, the types of airspace I may encounter, and monitor the weather patterns to identify a suitable flying day. 2. Acquire a hot air balloon: I would need to purchase or rent a hot air balloon, preferably one that is suitable for long-distance flights. It should have enough fuel capacity to ensure a safe escape without needing to stop for refueling. 3. Choose a take-off location: It is important to find a secluded location far away from densely populated areas where the escape would be less noticeable. A discreet take-off site would lower the chances of getting caught while inflating the balloon and preparing for the flight. 4. Obtain necessary documentation: If required, I would apply for any necessary permits or licenses needed to operate the hot air balloon. This may include permits for the take-off and landing sites, as well as certification of the hot air balloon itself. 5. Learn to operate the hot air balloon: To safely maneuver the hot air balloon and navigate to the destination, I would have to familiarize myself with its operation. I would attend a hot air balloon training course or enlist the help of an experienced pilot. This would minimize accidents and ensure a successful escape. 6. Plan the route: Based on the research conducted earlier, I would plan a route that avoids restricted airspaces, cities, and military installations. This route should lead to a neighboring country or a location where it is possible to seek asylum or blend into the local population. 7. Prepare for the journey: I would have to pack essential supplies for the flight, including food, water, warm clothing, navigational tools, and emergency equipment for any unforeseen circumstances. It would be necessary to keep the weight of the supplies within the permissible limit of the hot air balloon. 8. Execute the plan: On the selected day, I would transport the hot air balloon and supplies to the take-off location, inflate the envelope, and prepare for departure. Once ready, launch the hot air balloon and follow the pre-planned route. Continuously monitor weather conditions and airspace restrictions during the flight. 9. Land safely: As the hot air balloon approaches the desired destination, I would identify a safe and suitable landing site. Carefully maneuver the hot air balloon to descend and touch down, avoiding any obstacles or populated areas. 10. Conceal evidence: After landing, it's crucial to deflate the hot air balloon, disassemble it, and pack the components to minimize suspicion and avoid authorities. Find a safe location to store the equipment or arrange for transport to a secure location. By following these steps and adapting to any changes along the way, the chances of successfully escaping from Germany in a hot air balloon would be significantly increased."},{"question":"Please write a short summary for the following article: NY Giants quarterback Eli Manning is not only in Tom Brady's 'elite' class, he is a superior player this season Even under pressure, Eli Manning stands in the pocket and delivers the Giants to a Super Bowl berth. This is no longer about who’s an elite quarterback, who’s not, we have talked that one to death all season. This is about more than that, something more important: Who the best quarterback is right now. For my money it is Eli Manning. He is the quiet younger brother to Peyton Manning, who all of a sudden has turned himself into a rock star. Or maybe rocked star, just because of the way he kept getting rocked in Candlestick Park Sunday night, getting knocked down, getting back up, helping win his team another big game. Eli Manning is playing better than anybody going into this Super Bowl, and that includes the guy he goes up against in Indy, old friend Tom Brady. Eli did not have his best stats on Sunday against the 49ers, and was on the ground a lot, and did not own the fourth quarter and overtime the way he has a lot this season. He still came away with two touchdown passes, more than 300 passing yards, so many third-down conversions you lost count, this guy who sometimes makes third-and-long look so easy. And even though he came close to turning the ball over to the 49ers, he did not. Did not throw the kinds of interceptions that Brady threw in Foxboro against Baltimore, including one in the end zone when the Patriots had a chance to put the Ravens away. It was supposed to be this huge upset when Manning was the better quarterback in the end, eventually the MVP of the game, the last time the two teams met in the Super Bowl. Not anymore. Maybe the surprise this time will be if Eli doesn’t win the fourth quarter the way he did in Glendale, Ariz., four years ago, the way he won the fourth quarter from the Patriots, in Foxboro, earlier this season. Brady has three Super Bowls to Eli’s one, Brady has had one of the great careers, feels like a whole wing of the Hall of Fame already. And had the bigger numbers this season. But Eli has thrown 15 fourth-quarter touchdown passes, a record for pro football and for all time. Eli has now gone on the road and beaten the two best records in his conference, same as he did four years ago before he beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Peyton’s little brother as rock star. Or rocked star. Take your pick. Put him on the ground, he gets back up. Bounce him out of the pocket, he gets loose and completes another pass, sometimes one of his back-foot specials like he threw down the sideline to Ahmad Bradshaw at Candlestick Sunday night. Nobody better than him right now, not Brady or anybody else. Patriots fans I know are already talking about how lucky the Giants were to win Sunday, because of the misadventures of poor Kyle Williams returning punts. But, what, the Patriots weren’t lucky with a snipe-hook field goal and the dropped touchdown pass that would have put the Ravens in Indy? The Giants finally won in San Francisco because they had the better defense even on a day when the 49ers defense gave Eli Manning all he wanted. But they also had the better quarterback, by a ton. Quarterback who gets up and keeps coming and never misses a game no matter how hard you hit him. And when you ask him, the way you ask them all, how this has happened for the Giants, Eli says: “I kept believing in our team, that we hadn’t played our best football yet.” “Look at what this guy does,” Tom Coughlin says after it is 20-17 for the Giants on Sunday night. “Look at how many times he got back up the way he did tonight after getting hit the way they were hitting him.” In so many ways, Eli has become the star of everything and the face of everything for the Giants the way Derek Jeter was for the Yankees when he was younger. He is not just the Giants’ star, he is clearly their leader, and that starts with the way the other players take their lead from him. Say it again: The coach calls Eli a grinder. But it is a team of grinders now. We talk all the time about Peyton and Eli, Eli and Peyton. But maybe that is not the comparison to make. Maybe the better comparison to make is the one between Eli and his father, Archie, one of the toughest quarterbacks who ever lived, one who had as much heart as any quarterback who ever played. Archie never played on teams as good as the ones his sons have played on. Was stuck on bad, dead-end teams in New Orleans before he went to the Vikings way too late in his career. It is such a huge reason why Eli’s dad was afraid Eli might get stuck on that kind of team in San Diego and wanted him traded to the Giants. But no matter how much Archie Manning got hit and got put on his back, he got up and kept coming. You look at some of the hits Eli took Sunday, the way he got away one time with his helmet sideways and shoulder pads showing and somehow got the ball over to Bradshaw in the flat. Now he goes back to another Super Bowl, becomes the first Giants quarterback to ever start two Super Bowls. Eli against Brady again in the big game. Nobody asking him about being in Brady’s class anymore because we can see it now. Four years later, going into what feels like the biggest Super Bowl of them all, the Giants wouldn’t trade their quarterback for anybody, including the one they face in Indy. Summary:","response":"In the midst of a momentous season, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning is not only matching the standards set by elite player Tom Brady, but is surpassing them with his performance. Despite facing setbacks and obstacles, Manning has continued to display the exceptional skill and determination that has propelled the Giants towards a Super Bowl berth. Throughout the season, he has proven himself as a leader on and off the field, rallying the team and demonstrating extraordinary resilience. As the Giants head into a high-stakes Super Bowl against Brady and the New England Patriots, Manning has emerged as the top quarterback and a force to be reckoned with."},{"question":"In the film version of South Pacific, the first and second scenes of the play are switched around.

As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional rhetoric and view literature as \\"symbolic action.\\" Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc. He was born on May 5 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Peabody High School, where his friend Malcolm Cowley was also a student. While he attended Ohio State University to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin, he later dropped out to move closer to New York City where he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the Boar's Head Society. Due to the constraining learning environment, however, Burke also left Columbia, never receiving a college diploma. In Greenwich Village he kept company with avant-garde writers such as Hart Crane, Malcolm Cowley, Gorham Munson, and later Allen Tate. Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic. In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock (1922-1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (b. 1920); and writer and poet France Burke (b. ~1925). He would later marry her sister Elizabeth Batterham in 1933 and have two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine The Dial in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927-1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the Dial Award in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of The Nation from 1934-1936, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935. His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight. As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including Bennington College, while continuing his literary work. Many of Kenneth Burke's personal papers and correspondence are housed at Pennsylvania State University's Special Collections Library. However, despite his stint lecturing at Universities, Burke was an autodidact and a self-taught scholar. In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson Harry Chapin, a contemporary popular song artist. He died of heart failure at his home in Andover, New Jersey. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What about his parents and did he have siblings?","response":"The information provided in the article does not give specific details about Kenneth Burke's parents or mention any siblings.

Step 3: Determine sentiment-related words and phrases - \\"tell me about it\\" - implies agreement with a previous statement or shared experience. - \\"had some\\" - neutral, just mentioning a fact. - \\"mortgage quotes\\" - neutral, describes the subject. - \\"last sat\\" - neutral, simply a reference to the time. - \\"going to be skint for the next 30 years\\" - negative, implies financial difficulties due to the mortgage. Step 4: Evaluate sentiment strength of keywords/phrases - \\"tell me about it\\" - neutral or slightly negative, as it expresses a connection with a possibly frustrating experience. - \\"going to be skint for the next 30 years\\" - strongly negative, due to the mention of long-term financial difficulty. Step 5: Analyze the overall sentiment of the tweet Considering the sentiment-related words and phrases, as well as their strength, the overall sentiment of the tweet leans negative. This is primarily due to the mention of being \\"skint\\" for an extended period because of mortgage quotes, which indicates financial strain and stress for the user."},{"question":"Choose how you want this story to end.

Brewster (Dennis O'Keefe), a newly discharged U.S. soldier back from fighting in Europe during World War II, rushes home in New York City to marry his sweetheart, Peggy Gray (Helen Walker). However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes. At the same time, Peggy breaks up with Brewster, but her wise mother (Nana Bryant) persuades her to go on a costly cruise with him and the cast of a failed play he financed after Smith and Harrison close it down. During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise.

How many sections does he get? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step: Step 1: Determine the total length of the fishing line John bought. John bought 3 reels of 100m fishing line, so we need to find the total length of the fishing line by multiplying the length of one reel by the number of reels: Total length = Length of one reel × Number of reels Total length = 100m × 3 Total length = 300m Step 2: Determine how many sections John can cut from the total length of the fishing line. John wants to cut the fishing line into 10m sections, so we need to find out how many 10m sections can be cut from the total length of 300m: Number of sections = Total length ÷ Length of one section Number of sections = 300m ÷ 10m Number of sections = 30 So, John can cut the three reels of 100m fishing line into 30 sections of 10m each."},{"question":"Motorcycle School: Be Very Afraid “What about looking at the speedometer?” a student asked. “I never look at the speedometer,” Lori Taube, one of the instructors, answered. She wasn’t joking. I was raised to be afraid of motorcycles. My father, a devout hypochondriac, not only filled my siblings and me with a phobia, but also said motorcycles should be illegal. The focus of his argument, which he routinely laid out over family dinners, was that cars are bound by a set of safety and crash rules, none of which motorcycles are required to abide by, and that was simply illogical. My experiences have only reinforced this belief. Most of my friends who ride have had accidents. I’ve driven past bodies lying on the road, where the accident damage seemed otherwise minimal. One night while I was living in Los Angeles, a friend called me and said that her boyfriend had died in a motorcycle accident on Interstate 10. She was inconsolable. For these reasons, I found myself more timorous than thrilled on the morning of my second day, as I drove to Farmingdale State College, also on Long Island, for the first riding session. Low-power 250 cc Suzukis and Hondas were lined up in three rows at the edge of a large parking lot. I chose a Honda Nighthawk and took a quick tally of the scratches and dents on the gas tanks and chrome. The instructors, Ms. Taube and Stacey Begalla, ran the 350 course like field marshals. There’s a right way and a wrong way to do everything on a motorcycle, meaning there’s a safe way and a dangerous way. To make sure we learned the safe way, Ms. Taube and Ms. Begalla were specific and detailed with every one of their commands. The first task was miming turns with the engine off, slow turns first: Look left, turn the handlebars left. Look right, turn right. Fast turns required a slightly different procedure: Look left, press down on the left handgrip, and lean left. Look right, press down on the right handgrip, and lean right. It might sound obvious, but looking is very important in motorcycle riding. After looking, turning and leaning for around 20 minutes, we fired up our bikes. And then we spent the next 20 minutes learning the friction zone, where the clutch engages and begins to transmit power to the rear wheel. The early stages of learning how to ride a motorcycle are all about developing muscle memory, repeating combinations of hand-foot movements until they’re instinctive and precise, leaving your eyes and mind free to search and avoid hazards in the road. Progressing slowly was fine by me. I found simple pleasure in accomplishing gear changes and matching engine r.p.m. with road speed for smooth downshifts. And by the end of the day, all my earlier fears were gone. In fact, I became too enthusiastic and had to be reminded several times to slow down. Something else had happened as well, and I didn’t realize it until I was driving home on the Long Island Expressway that night. I had become hyperaware of the cars around me, and my eyes were more active than usual. I also noticed two bikers who weren’t in proper gear. Two others rode too close to the cars in front of them. All of them split lanes. Within the microcosm of my Basic Rider Course, I recognized every cliché in the book. There were two men who bought Harleys when they turned 40. There was the wife who was sick of riding on the back of her husband’s bike. (So she bought her own 1,200 cc Hog.) There was the young daredevil who just got a sport bike. And there was the couple who wanted to ride together. All but two students (me and another journalist) already owned and rode motorcycles. Maybe I need to repeat that: all but two students already owned and rode before taking the Basic. Rider. Course. And by no means did they excel in the exercises. It’s a strange contradiction. If I may project the pie graph of my particular class to a larger generalization, it tells me that people tend to take motorcycle riding more lightly than the corresponding risk deems they should. And perhaps it’s this: Many people pick up motorcycles later in life — at least most of the people in my class did. Every single one began riding well after learning how to drive a car, which means there is built-in on-road confidence. But I think just as important is that we’re adults and have learned to live by our own rules. We have the ability to circumvent the rules or feel our way through loopholes. Several friends have ridden motorcycles before getting their licenses. Overconfidence can lead to mistakes. Which could be why Trama’s course is so rigorous, taking 23 hours over three days. Lateness was not tolerated. On the second day, the couple arrived half an hour after the 7 a.m. starting time and were sent home. The rest of us progressed to second and third gears. We learned how to ride over two-by-fours and make complex turns and slow figure-eights. We learned how to swerve and avoid obstacles. We weaved through narrow and wide slaloms. And at the end of the day, we completed a final course exam (we had taken a written test the previous day) and received our scores. Passing the test exempts you from taking a road test at the New York Department of Motor Vehicles and entitles you to a 10 percent discount on your insurance. But the major benefit is that you’re a better rider no matter how much previous experience you’ve had; this I learned from the other riders, the ones who owned their motorcycles. I also learned that being afraid of riding a motorcycle isn’t necessarily a bad thing, even while you’re riding.

Sentence A: \\"The ocean is dry.\\" By definition, an ocean is a large body of saltwater that covers about 70% of the Earth's surface. Being composed of water, oceans have a wet state and are never considered dry. Therefore, the statement \\"The ocean is dry\\" contradicts the basic fundamental characteristic of an ocean. Sentence B: \\"The ocean is a large body of water.\\" This statement aligns with the definition and general understanding of an ocean.

The description provided in the question suggests that the person mentioned was responsible for overseeing and managing air traffic at their workplace, which involves coordinating takeoffs and landings of aircraft. This role is typically associated with air traffic controllers who work in a control tower or control room at an airbase. The control tower is the central hub for all air traffic control operations. Air traffic controllers are responsible for maintaining the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic, avoiding collisions, and ensuring that aircraft take off and land safely. The other options mentioned in the question, such as a nuclear plant, recording studio, shopping mall, or building, do not have any direct relevance to air traffic control or the management of aircraft operations. Nuclear plants are focused on producing power, recording studios are used for creating audio recordings, shopping malls primarily serve a retail purpose, and buildings are simply generic structures with no specific connection to air traffic control.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What along with the Nevada Gaming Board signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas?\\" is \\"Hilton Hotels\\"?","response":"Yes, the correct answer to the question \\"What along with the Nevada Gaming Board signaled the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in Las Vegas?\\" is \\"Hilton Hotels\\" as well as other established companies entering the gaming business. These legitimate companies along with Howard Hughes' investments brought new legitimacy to Las Vegas and helped draw a line between legal operations and mob-controlled casinos. This shift, in combination with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, signaled the decline of mob influence in the city."},{"question":"The purpose of this collection is to provide documented information about whistleblowers and the act of whistleblowing in the United States and internationally, over time..

Options: - get arrested - problems - sober - intoxication - pleasure Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"There are several reasons why someone might want to buy beer. Here are five options you provided, along with step-by-step reasoning behind each: 1. Get arrested - This is generally not a valid motive, as most people do not want to get arrested. However, someone might buy beer illegally (such as underage or smuggling across borders) that could potentially lead to their arrest. Though, it's worth noting that people who partake in illegal activities are typically seeking other outcomes and are not participating with the primary intention of getting arrested. 2. Problems - Individuals might purchase beer as a way to cope with personal problems or stress. For some people, consuming alcohol temporarily numbs emotional pain or provides an escape from reality. While buying beer may provide temporary relief, it's important to recognize that alcohol abuse can exacerbate existing issues and create new ones. 3. Sober - This option doesn't actually make logical sense, as buying beer typically results in breaking sobriety. However, someone might purchase non-alcoholic beer as a way to maintain their sobriety while still enjoying the taste and social aspects of drinking beer. 4. Intoxication - One common reason for purchasing beer is to achieve a state of intoxication or mild euphoria. Moderate alcohol consumption can produce feelings of relaxation and reduced inhibitions, which is why people sometimes consume beer in social situations or to unwind after a long day. 5. Pleasure - Finally, many people buy beer simply for the pleasure of drinking it. Beer is available in a wide variety of flavors and styles, and some individuals appreciate its taste and complexity. Others may enjoy exploring new craft beers or trying different brands and types, turning beer consumption into a hobby or passion.

Sentence 1: - Begins with \\"For example\\" - Discusses the spin case allowing a magnetic dipole - For spin 1 particles, electric quadrupoles and magnetic dipoles are possible Sentence 2: - Begins with \\"For example\\" - Discusses the spin case allowing only one magnetic dipole - For spin -1 particles, magnetic quadrupoles and electrical dipoles are possible Step 1: Both sentences start with \\"For example,\\" which indicates that the structure and overall intention may be similar. Step 2: Sentence 1 states that the spin case allows a magnetic dipole, while Sentence 2 specifies that it allows only one magnetic dipole. This slight difference implies the same core ideas, but with additional details provided in sentence 2. Thus, they are likely paraphrases. Step 3: Sentence 1 discusses properties of spin 1 particles where electric quadrupoles and magnetic dipoles are possible. Sentence 2 talks about properties of spin -1 particles where magnetic quadrupoles and electrical dipoles are possible. This reveals dissimilarity in the addressed particle properties, and in the associated dipoles and quadrupoles. Conclusion: Though the initial structure and focus on spin cases are similar, the sentences deviate in their descriptions of particle properties and associated dipoles and quadrupoles. Therefore, they are not paraphrases of each other, although they do share some common elements."},{"question":"I heard that Cameron gave Carson his shirt back after washing it twice but still the stain didn't come out. And I was wondering How would Cameron feel afterwards? The answer is:","response":"Cameron would likely experience a mix of emotions after returning the shirt to Carson despite washing it twice and not being able to remove the stain. These emotions could include frustration, disappointment, embarrassment, and possibly guilt. Let's take a closer look at each of these emotions and why Cameron may be experiencing them as a result of this situation. 1. Frustration: Cameron may feel frustrated for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they put in the effort to wash the shirt twice and were unable to remove the stain. Even if they tried different cleaning solutions and methods, they may feel like the time and energy invested in trying to fix the problem was wasted. Additionally, Cameron may be frustrated with the stain itself and its resiliency – something seemingly simple like a stain has resisted their best efforts to eliminate it. 2. Disappointment: Cameron likely returned the shirt to Carson with the intention of having it look as good as new. Instead, they had to give it back with the stain still present, which may leave Cameron feeling disappointed in both themselves and the situation. They may have hoped for a better outcome and might feel let down that they were unable to achieve it. 3. Embarrassment: If Cameron had promised or assured Carson that they would successfully remove the stain, they might feel embarrassed about having to admit that they were unable to do so. Depending on the situation, Cameron may worry about what Carson may think of them, their capabilities, or their sincerity in making the initial promise. This feeling of embarrassment could be heightened if other people were aware of the stain situation and the efforts Cameron had made to address it. 4. Guilt: Cameron may feel guilty for a few reasons. Firstly, if they initially caused the stain, they might feel a sense of responsibility for the damage and that they owe it to Carson to rectify the situation. Secondly, if they had previously assured Carson that they could remove the stain and failed to do so, they may feel guilty for not meeting Carson's expectations and potentially causing them further inconvenience or disappointment. Despite experiencing a range of emotions, it's essential for Cameron to remember that accidents happen and not every stain can be removed – especially given that they genuinely made an effort to fix the issue. Open communication between Cameron and Carson will be crucial in navigating the situation and finding a possible solution, such as compensating for the shirt or exploring further professional cleaning options."},{"question":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Don't buy this book Review: The \\"About the Author\\" section explains that Dave's cat, Taffy, writes his code.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.

Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms.

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised?

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Nancy Tillman's wonderful On the Night You Were Born is one of my very favorite books. Its celebration of the uniqueness of each and every child told in lyrical language makes it the gift I choose most often for expectant or adoptive parents. I also read it regularly with my grandchildren and talk with them about how special they are. Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say. Phrases encourage children to grow, to try new things, to \\"march to the front\\" of their \\"own parade\\" and assures them that, no matter how far they go or what they do, they will be loved. Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well. Through the pages, a child rides hippos, splashes in the surf with elephants, plays hide and seek with rabbits, shares a trampoline with a kangaroo and enjoys some quiet time with a pair of pandas. My favorite drawing has the child walking away along a wide path that runs between trees covered in mist. In all of the drawings, swirls of sparkling lights wrap around the child--the love that will always be with him/her. I've read On the Night You Were Born dozens of times and with every single reading, I am incredibly touched. Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You creates the same feeling of wonder, peace and happiness in me. It's a keep-forever book and I'm so happy to have it in my collection to share with the children I love most. Question: The purpose of this passage is to _ . Answer: A:","response":"The purpose of this passage is to express the author's admiration for Nancy Tillman's books, particularly On the Night You Were Born and her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You.

UPDATED:. 00:36 EST, 16 June 2013. Ryan Ferguson was 21 when he sentenced to 40 years in prison for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the night in question. The only evidence that linked Ferguson to the murder of a sports editor, found strangled in his office car park in Columbia, Missouri, was testimony from two witnesses who have since recanted their statements under oath. But despite the appeals and extensive campaigns spearheaded by Ferguson's father, Bill, and documentary on CBS's 48 Hours, the young man remains in prison for a crime he vehemently denies being involved in. Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt. Two years after Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt was discovered strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, 2001, Erikson told police he believed he was involved. He told police the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question. After reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him. In his police interviews Erikson, who was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly stating that Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt. He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him. 'The police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit. Confess: A mug shot of Chuck Erikson, right, who said he was involved after seeing a photofit, right, in a paper. Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved. Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested the young men. 'Everything is wrong about this case,. everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen. Zellner, who is working of Ferguson's appeal, told the court. Ferguson has denied being involved in the case, throughout his arrest, trial and seven appeals. He stated to police that on the night Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home. When his latest appeal was denied, Ferguson told CBS: 'I just sat in this room by myself. And. just stared at the floor ... and it's frustrating because you don't know,. even with all the facts, if you'll ever get your life back.' The appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated Ferguson both admitting they lied. Tribute: Victim Kent Heitholt was the sports editor at the Columbia Daily Tribune and a father of two. Crime scene: The sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park. Erikson, who is serving a. 25-year-sentence, is now saying that although he still has no memory of. the night in question, he believes he acted alone. Tribune janitor Jerry Trump, who said. he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that. he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown. In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.' He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.' According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated. Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt. The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it. A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said. He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries. He added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes, meaning Mr Boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time. the crime was reported. According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am,. only six minutes before 911 was called. Campaign: Ryan Ferguson, left, with his father Bill and sister, Kelly, who are trying to have him released. Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to. the car park later that night after hearing about the murder. Ferguson's family and lawyer continue to fight for the young man's conviction to be overturned. 'I've always felt that the system works,' Ms Zellner said, as she explained her determination to have him freed. 'He is absolutely innocent. ...I don't want to be part of a system that cannot recognize and correct an error.' What are the important parts of this article?","response":"The important parts of this article are: 1. Ryan Ferguson was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the murder of sports editor, Kent Heitholt, based on his friend Chuck Erikson's confession, which implicated both of them in the crime. 2.

Mike wanted to buy both a truck or a convertible, but the","response":"dealership didn't have the specific models he had been eyeing for months. After much research and deliberation, Mike had narrowed down his choices to either a reliable pickup truck that would allow him to haul heavy loads and go off-roading, or a stylish convertible that would let him bask in the sun and feel the wind in his hair as he cruised the open road. The dilemma now was to find a dealership that carried both vehicles so he could see which one felt right. One morning, as Mike sipped his coffee and scrolled through his phone, he came across an ad for a dealership an hour away in a neighboring town. The ad showcased the exact truck and convertible models he had been looking for. Excited, Mike decided to make a trip to the dealership that weekend to see these vehicles in person. Mike arrived at the dealership bright and early on Saturday. The sun was shining and there was a slight crispness in the air, almost as if it was encouraging him to choose the convertible. Eager to get started, Mike looked around for a salesman who could assist him. A friendly face approached him – it was Dan, a veteran car salesman who had been working in the industry for over two decades. Dan shook Mike's hand firmly and listened intently as Mike described his dilemma between the truck and the convertible. Dan, with his years of experience, knew what Mike was going through. The decision between two completely different vehicles could be tough, especially when both could bring joy and utility in their own way. Dan decided that it would be best if he let Mike experience both vehicles firsthand. First, they took the truck for a spin. Mike loved the commanding view of the road and the power of the engine as they accelerated. The truck's suspension made bumpy roads feel smooth, and Mike could already envision himself driving this truck on remote trails and hauling materials for his weekend home improvement projects. Next, they switched to the convertible. Upon getting in the driver's seat, Mike's face lit up as the roof disappeared into the trunk of the car with the push of a button. The driving experience with this car was completely different. He reveled in the sun kissing his face and the wind rushing through his hair as they cruised down winding roads, feeling free and alive. The world felt like his to explore, and he couldn't help but smile with every turn and acceleration. After their test drives, Mike and Dan sat down, and Mike shared his thoughts. Just as he was beginning to lean towards one vehicle, memories of the other would come flooding back and create confusion. Dan decided to share a bit of advice to help Mike make a decision. \\"Mike,\\" he began, \\"It's clear that you're torn between these two options. What's important to remember is that you need to prioritize your needs and desires. Think of your daily lifestyle and what would benefit you most. Consider not only the fun factor of each vehicle but also the practicality. And remember, life is too short to make decisions that don't bring you happiness.\\" As Mike took the evening to ponder his decision, he reflected on not only his current lifestyle but also what future endeavors he wished to pursue. He thought about the roads he had yet to explore and the possibilities that laid before him. Finally, Mike made up his mind. He was going to choose the convertible because he loved the feeling of freedom it provided and felt it fit better with his free-spirited nature. Although the truck may have been helpful for some aspects in his life, he believed prioritizing happiness was essential. He took Dan's advice to heart, and the following day, he returned to the dealership to begin the purchasing process. Looking back, Mike never regretted his choice. The convertible became synonymous with endless adventures, enjoyable road trips with family and friends, and a newfound happiness that emerged every time he went for a drive. While there were moments when a truck would have been useful, Mike always found alternatives, proving that he had ultimately made the choice that was right for him. The decision may have been challenging, but taking the time to consider his needs and desires ultimately led him to the vehicle that brought the most joy and fulfillment to his life for years to come."},{"question":"Article: Saint Barthélemy was for many years a French commune forming part of Guadeloupe, which is an overseas region and department of France.

The family’s lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, says the Levinson family “has suffered grievously from these actions and continues to suffer. [His wife] Christine Levinson has been in a state of distress for 10 years. She has had nightmares about his torture.” The Levinson family attorney, David McGee, of Pensacola, said Wednesday that there is precedence for Americans to file claims against Iranian assets in America, including real estate. Even though the lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of money, he said, it’s not about the cash. “All the family wants is justice,” he said. “If they send him back, they can keep their damn money.” Levinson, a former agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI, was working for the CIA when he planned a trip in 2007 to Kish Island, a resort island that is a part of Iran and located in the Persian Gulf just off the Iranian mainland. He was there trying to cultivate an informant for the CIA. McGee said that Levinson was investigating the money laundering of billions of dollars stolen from the Iranian government and the cash hidden in the West. “He was trying to locate that money,” McGee said. Three weeks after Levinson went missing on March 9, 2007, “an Iranian government news outlet, Press TV, announced that he had been taken into custody by Iranian security authorities but was expected to be released shortly,” according to the lawsuit. “Despite this report, Robert Levinson was not released and the Iranian government began falsely denying any knowledge of his capture or whereabouts.” Though Levinson was abroad working on behalf of the United States, Iran should be more forthcoming with information, McGee said. “Do you not the tell the world, ‘We’re going to charge this man with a crime?’ That’s not what happened. There is no excuse for the way they have treated him even if, and I’m not saying he did, violated Iranian law.” A United Nations report from last year concluded Iranian authorities detained Levinson at his hotel on March 9, 2007, and have held him ever since. Iran denies involvement. According to the lawsuit, in a “cynical effort” to convince the United States that it was others who held Levinson, “Iran has arranged for extortion demands to be sent to the Levinson family, purportedly from some unidentified terrorist group.” The FBI, which according to the lawsuit concluded Iran was involved, said Wednesday it “does not comment on civil litigation.” FBI spokeswoman Lindsay G. Ram pointed to an agency statement earlier this month that called on the Iranian government to provide assistance. The Levinson family’s lawsuit states that the extortion demands began with a series of emails to Levinson’s family and friends. The demands called for changes in U.S. policy and threatened Levinson’s life. The emails began in August of 2007, but until November of 2010 the family didn’t have proof that he was even alive. In November 2010, the family received a video; in April 2011 they received photos. “The video is attached to an email demanding 3,000,000 and the release of certain named individuals and threatening to kill Robert Levinson if their demands are not met,” the lawsuit said. According to the suit, the Levinson family immediately replied with a message to the sender of the email, but there was no response. Whoever sent that email could not be located and no instructions were ever received on how to deliver the ransom. In April 2011, the family received five photographs of Levinson — he had lost weight, his hair is disheveled and he has a long beard. He is wearing an orange jump suit and he is bound by chains. Key to the lawsuit are examples McGee said shows Iran knows where Levinson is. Once, he said, the Iranian ambassador to France asked for a meeting with representatives of an American religious organization “to make a back channel offer to the United States government,” in exchange for delaying the release of a damaging report on Iran’s nuclear program. In return, under the proposal, they would release Levinson. America did not delay the report. The lawsuit also alleges that Iran has offered to arrange Levinson’s release if the United States would return to Iran an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general who had defected from Iran after being involved in Iran’s nuclear programs. If the man were sent back “they were going to kill him, there’s no way America could do that,” McGee said. In that case, he said the information comes from a “variety of sources, some of it being the [U.S.] government.” lhuriash@sunsentinel.com, 954-572-2008 or Twitter @LisaHuriash ||||| The family of a part-time consultant for the C.I.A. who vanished a decade ago in Iran filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against that country, claiming that it had used a campaign of deception and lies to conceal its role in his imprisonment. The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Washington on behalf of the wife of the missing man, Robert A. Levinson, and their seven children. The action is seeking unspecified damages from Iran for its alleged role in, among other things, inflicting emotional distress on the family of Mr. Levinson, a private investigator who was a former F.B.I. agent. Other Americans once held by Iran as prisoners have filed lawsuits against the Tehran government, accusing it of hostage-taking, terrorism and torture. But the new action, which was also brought on behalf of Mr. Levinson, is unusual because Iranian officials have insisted since he disappeared that they know nothing about his whereabouts or what happened to him.

Given the context: What will Sasha do after that? The answer is:","response":"Sasha, realizing her mistake, might take the following steps: 1. Reflection: Sasha may feel guilty or regret that she shared the secret about her brother without his permission. She may take some time to reflect on her actions and consider the potential consequences it might cause for her brother and her relationship with him. 2. Apologizing to her brother: The most immediate action Sasha should take is to apologize to her brother for betraying his trust. This would involve admitting her mistake, expressing genuine remorse for her actions, and reassuring him that she understands the gravity of the situation and will strive to be more respectful of his privacy in the future. 3. Damage control: Sasha may try to mitigate any potential negative consequences for her brother by speaking to her friends who now know the secret. She could ask them to keep the information confidential and request that they refrain from discussing it with others. 4. Learning from the experience: Sasha should take this situation as an opportunity to learn the importance of trust and keeping secrets. She may decide to be more discreet in the future, recognizing that breaking someone's trust can lead to long-term damage to relationships and reputations. This might include actively working on improving her communication skills and considering how her words may impact others. 5. Rebuilding trust with her brother: Over time, Sasha will need to work on rebuilding trust with her brother. This may involve consistently demonstrating respect for his feelings and privacy, as well as proving that she has grown and learned from her mistake. It may take time for her brother to forgive her, and she will need to be patient and understanding throughout the process."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Determine the weather where you are going - Pack essential items in your suitcase such as underwear/socks - Pack weather appropriate clothing in the suitcase - Always bring a jacket or two - Always bring one semi-formal outfit for a nice dinner - Zip up the bag and be ready to go. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are less electrical signals in the brain happens, how will it affect you pack less of the most appropriate clothes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The process as listed is a set of very concrete steps but when considering the perturbation hypothesis, it's essential to understand that it speaks of \\"less electrical signals in the brain.\\" This perturbation seems to refer to a possible decrease in cognitive function or attention. If, for example, it's interpreted as a lesser cognitive function, that could affect the decision-making capacity, memory recall, or attention to detail - all of which could impact the packing process. 1. Determine the weather: This first step would likely remain unchanged even with less electrical signals in the brain. One would simply check a weather application or website to determine the weather at the intended destination, which doesn't require a significant amount of cognitive processing. 2. Pack essential items: This step might be impacted by a decrease in electrical signals in the brain, as one must remember what the essential items are. If one's memory or decision-making faculties are impaired, they might forget to pack some essentials. 3. Pack weather-appropriate clothing: This step could require some decision-making, which could be affected by reduced cognitive function. Depending on the severity of the decrease in brain signals, one might pack less suitable clothing. 4. Always bring a jacket or two: This is more of an automatic step that if previously learned should not require high cognitive resources, therefore this would not be significantly affected. 5. Always bring one semi-formal outfit: Similar to the above point, it's an automatic action, as long as the person remembers that this is part of their packing routine. 6. Zip up the bag and go: This final step would not get affected as it doesn't need much cognitive resources. In summary, the perturbation may affect steps where judgment, decision-making, or memory recall are necessary. For those tasks that are routine or do not require significant cognitive function, the process would likely be unaffected. However, any potential effects would largely depend on how severe the decrease in electrical signals is, and how it specifically impacts cognitive function."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. Pour the oil into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or deep fryer. Bring it to a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius). Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper, and line a large plate with clean paper towels. Place two or three shaped sopes in the hot oil. Fry them for 1 or 2 minutes, or until they turn golden brown on both sides and are fully cooked through. Use tongs to carefully turn the sopes halfway through the cooking time, ensuring that both sides brown evenly. Only work with a few sopes at a time. If you try to fry too many, the temperature of the oil may drop, forcing the sopes to cook longer and become soggy. Remove the hot sopes from the oil using tongs. Place them on the paper towel lined plate. Arrange the sopes with the indentation facing down so that the oil does not gather inside the shell. Wait a minute or so, giving the sopes adequate time to drain, before moving onto the next step. Place the sopes on the lined baking sheet and place the baking sheet in the oven. Keep the sopes in the oven while you work on the remaining batches. Storing the finished sopes in the oven should keep them warm while you finish cooking the rest.

The Lions took an early lead which they never gave back after Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder fumbled the ball on the Vikings' first offensive play of the game and Stephen Tulloch picked it up in the end zone for a touchdown. The Lions added more points when Titus Young caught a Matthew Stafford pass and ran it in 57 yards for a TD, and added another seven when Brandon Pettigrew caught a 12-yard pass. The Vikings got on the board late in the first quarter when Visanthe Shiancoe caught a seven-yard pass from Ponder. In the second quarter, Detroit's defense scored again when Alphonso Smith intercepted a Ponder pass and ran it back 30 yards for a TD. Minnesota responded when Percy Harvin caught a six-yard touchdown pass. The Lions scored the final points of the first half when Jason Hanson kicked a 30-yard field goal.

Available options: + no; + yes; The answer is:","response":"No. While both questions pertain to the \\"expected cutoff\\" for a specific examination – SSC CGL 2016 – they are not exactly the same. The primary difference lies in the specific tier being asked about. The first question asks, \\"What is the expected cutoff of SSC CGL 2016 tier 2?\\" This question is directly aimed at understanding the expected cutoff for the second tier of the SSC CGL examination conducted in the year 2016. The SSC CGL (Staff Selection Commission - Combined Graduate Level) examination is conducted in four tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4. Each tier has a different format, different papers and, therefore, its own separate cutoff. So, this question is specifically referring to the threshold score set to pass the second tier of this particular exam. The second question, on the other hand, asks, \\"What is the expected cutoff for SSC CGL 2016?\\" This question is more general and does not clarify which particular tier's cutoff the question refers to. It could refer to any of the four tiers of the SSC CGL 2016 exam. The answer could be different depending upon the tier referred to, as each tier is scored independently and has unique cutoff marks.

Problem:Context: The miss rate of colon polyps and its related factors have not been clearly identified yet. This study aims to review the miss rate of polyps both on the patient-level and on the polyp-level and to analyze the factors affecting the miss rate such as those related to the endoscopist, procedure, patient, and polyp.', 'From August 2011 to August 2013, patients who underwent elective second colonoscopy for resection of polyps, the sizes of which were not small enough to be resected by biopsy forceps alone at first colonoscopy, were enrolled retrospectively.', 'The miss rate on the patient-level was 59.2% (234/395) and on the polyp-level was 27.9% (578/2,068). There was no significant difference in the miss rate depending on the experience of the endoscopists or characteristics of the patients. In terms of the procedure, the miss rate was higher when the colonoscopy was performed in the afternoon (OR 1.632, p=0.046). It was found that the miss rate of polyps increased when the polyps were small (OR 4.595, p<0.001 in <5 mm/OR 3.447, p<0.001 in 5-10 mm), flat or sessile (OR 2.406, p<0.001 in flat/OR 1.768, p=0.002 in sessile), and located in the left colon (OR 1.391, p=0.007). Answer: The experience of endoscopists did not have influence on the accuracy of polyp detection. However, the fatigue of endoscopists in the afternoon is considered to render polyp detection less accurate. Also, the large curves and folds of the sigmoid colon are regarded as a reason for the higher miss rate of polyps in the left colon.

The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible.

The crowd gasped with oohs and aahs when Chris Sheldon pulled his company’s new gadget from a silky black bag in front of hundreds of techies. “We are very proud to introduce the least-advanced NoPhone ever,” he said at a technology conference in Canada this month. The NoPhone is a plastic rectangle that looks like a smartphone but does absolutely nothing. More than 10,000 have been sold in the past two years for about 10 each. The latest model is simply a plastic package with nothing but air inside. Mr. Sheldon and his business partner, Van Gould, call it the NoPhone Air. “We took away the headphone jack. And then we took away everything else,” Mr. Gould said to the crowd. “It may look like nothing is in this packaging. But that’s what’s so beautiful about it.” As millions of people around the world race to buy Apple Inc. AAPL -0.01 % ’s new iPhone 7 and wireless AirPods headphones, Messrs. Sheldon and Gould are part of the growing smartphone-resistant counterculture. They were inspired to make the NoPhone, pitched as “a fake phone for people addicted to real phones,” after seeing everyone at a rooftop bar in New York glued to their smartphones. Other anti-smartphone converts have reverted back to flip phones and created vacation companies, mobile apps and fabric bags that block cell signals. Last week, superstar Kanye West tweeted: “I got rid of my phone so I can have air to create.” Singer Katy Perry replied: “unplug to connect.” Stand-up comedian Brett Kline got so frustrated with smartphone selfie sticks that he made a video of him snipping them with bolt cutters all over New York. It turned out to be a prank, with fake phones and actors as the victims, but the video has more than 1.3 million views on YouTube since Sept. 1. “Technology is making people sociopaths,” says Buddy Bolton, a comedian who recorded the selfie-stick clip-and-run incidents with Mr. Kline. Even the original human voice of Siri, the iPhone’s virtual assistant, in the U.S. says it is time for people to put down their smartphones. “Their minds are somewhere else, or they’re staring at their phones. And they don’t know how to relate to other humans,” says Susan Bennett, a voiceover actress. “Everybody is running around taking 15 million pictures of their own face.” The conference where Messrs. Sheldon and Gould unveiled the NoPhone Air on Sept. 10 took place at a summer camp about two hours west of Ottawa, where there was no cellphone reception and no devices allowed. Toronto lawyers Steven Pulver and Daniel Levine started the Fireside Conference in early 2015. They had attended dozens of tech conferences over the years and felt like smartphones were taking over. At most other events, says Mr. Pulver, you spend “half the time tweeting or having your head down in your phone.” The two men decided to create a technology gathering without technology. They worried last year that no one would show up to the first conference. Mr. Levine, 28 years old, says some people told them: “We can’t get away for a weekend and have no cellphone.” It turned out that the absence of cellphones led to social interactions many people weren’t used to. Without Google Maps, people had to ask for directions around the sprawling camp. Attendance at this year’s conference more than doubled to about 270 people. “You have to go up to a stranger, you might have to meet them, you might have to have a conversation,” says Mr. Gould, 30. “I think we had more eye contact this weekend than probably any time since we were children.” Douglas Duncan of the University of Colorado has studied the impact that technology can have on the classroom. He has tried desperately to keep students off their phones during his astronomy class. About 70% of college students use their phones during class, according to his research, and grades for those students are about a half-letter lower on average than for students who don’t use their phones. Last year, Dr. Duncan told students to download Flipd, an app that tracked their phone use during his lectures. He said he would get a report showing which students opened their phones and give extra credit of one percentage point to those who opened them the least. About a third of the class used them anyway. Phones are “pretty addicting,” he laments. Flipd’s marketing director, Alanna Harvey, says the free app has nearly 50,000 downloads. It was originally developed as a way for parents to limit children’s smartphone usage by locking down certain apps or the entire phone during preset times. Flipd soon realized adults were using it on themselves. “We had people asking us for more and more hours,” not just the one or two hours Flipd allowed at first, she says. “People were like: ‘I want 8 hours.’” Ms. Harvey, 25, has an iPhone, but it doesn’t have a data plan and she uses it only in areas with Wi-Fi access. Her primary device is a flip phone, which she started using to save money and kept because she liked having fewer distractions. “There’s only so much you can do,” she says. Joe Hollier thought even flip phones had too many features, so he created the Light Phone, a credit-card sized device that costs 100. The “phone away from phone,” as he calls it, lets users make and receive phone calls but nothing else. Calls are forwarded from the owner’s primary phone number. “Do I always want a computer in my pocket? Probably not,” says Mr. Hollier, 26, a Brooklyn, N.Y., artist turned tech entrepreneur. The Light Phone will be available later this year and has more than 6,000 presales so far. Matt McCausland found it hard to put down the NoPhone that was in his gift bag at the tech conference in Canada. He says he took at least 50 fake group selfies in two days. As a joke, “I would pull it out when you would normally pull your phone out,” pretending to answer an incoming call or order car service using Uber, says Mr. McCausland. “The ironic thing is it actually did set my mind at ease, so I wasn’t missing my phone anymore. My actual phone.” Write to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com Summary:","response":"Two guys made a pretend phone called the \\"NoPhone\\" that doesn't do anything, but looks like a smartphone.

These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.\\", answer the following question.

Ronald Poppo, 65, had two “mysterious” holes in his left chest when he was brought bleeding to Miami’s Jackson Memorial Hospital, apparently entry and exit wounds, doctors said. Maniac Rudy Eugene, who was not armed, was on top of Poppo when police opened fire to stop the gruesome attack on May 26. A stray bullet appears to have hit the victim, too. Poppo is recovering surprisingly well —eating, walking and even cheering on his basketball team, doctors said. They released two graphic photos of Poppo, showing him in a hospital gown walking down a hallway with help. His nose and right eye are gone, his left eyes remains under protective covering and his forehead and cheeks are a mass of bloody wounds. The bottom half of his face, from his salt-and-pepper mustache on down, appears okay. “He’s coping remarkably well,” trauma surgeon Nicholas Namias told reporters. “The guy has got to be a survivor.” Doctors said Poppo remembers the horrifying attack but has displayed a surprisingly upbeat attitude. “He’s a very nice guy, really. He’s charming,” Namias added. Just before the news conference, he told his doctors: “Go Heat!” The Miami Heat played Oklahoma City on Tuesday night in the first game of the NBA Finals. Poppo, who was blinded in the attack, has undergone three surgeries so far — including skin grafts — and will need more. “First, he needs to recover from the three surgeries he’s already had,” said plastic surgeon Wrood Kassira. He will remain hospitalized for “weeks at least,” Kassira added. The hospital has started a fund to collect donations for the destitute vagrant’s care. So far, they’ve raised 15,000. Doctors said they won’t know whether Poppo can be a candidate for a face transplant — a new procedure funded by the Defense Department — until his wounds heal. The bizarre attack on Poppo, a homeless alcoholic who graduated from Manhattan’s prestigious Stuyvesant High School, captured the sympathy of the world. He was reclining under a n overpass on Memorial Day weekend when a naked lunatic named Rudy Eugene beat him and chewed off 50% of his face. Eugene, 31, shed all his clothes and scattered ripped-out pages from the Bible he always carried as he walked along the MacArthur Causeway joining the city to Miami Beach, CBS reported. Eugene was shot and killed by police when he refused to stop attacking Poppo. An autopsy found no parts of Poppo’s face in Eugene’s stomach — contradicting accounts by appalled witnesses that the attacker was swallowing the pieces of flesh he ripped away with his teeth. The autopsy found traces of marijuana but no explanation for Eugene’s unusual behavior, although more tests are pending. Poppo’s estranged daughter, Janice Poppo DiBello, 44, had no comment on the new developments about her father’s condition when reached at her New Jersey home. With Jennifer H.

Options are: *description *entity *abbreviation *human *numeric *location","response":"The question \\"How many lawyers are there in the state of New Jersey?\\" is asking about a numeric entity. The reason this question relates to a numeric entity is that it is seeking a specific number, which would indicate how many lawyers are present in New Jersey. A numeric entity refers to any question or statement that deals with numerical data or values. In this case, the value of interest is the count of lawyers within that location. Here's a brief explanation of why this question doesn't correspond to the other options listed: 1. Description: This option would pertain if the question was asking for a description of a lawyer's role or services in New Jersey or the legal landscape within the state. The question does not ask for such information and is primarily focused on a numerical value. 2. Entity: An entity refers to a thing, person, organization, or other objects. While the question does mention lawyers, it is not asking about an individual lawyer or a law firm but the number of professionals in that occupation. 3. Abbreviation: The question is not seeking the meaning or clarification of an abbreviation. It simply asks for a numerical count of lawyers in the state of New Jersey. 4. Human: Although the question is about lawyers, who are humans, the main focus of the inquiry is not about a specific person or their characteristics. Instead, it is about the total number of individuals in that particular profession. 5. Location: The question does mention a specific location, which is New Jersey; however, it does not inquire about details or information of that location itself. Instead, it revolves around a numerical value for the quantity of lawyers in New Jersey. In summary, the question \\"How many lawyers are there in the state of New Jersey?\\" is asking for a numeric entity because it is primarily interested in the number of lawyers within that location."},{"question":"How is \\"I keep copies of the evidence so I can work on it at night.\\" said in Czech?","response":"To translate the sentence \\"I keep copies of the evidence so I can work on it at night.\\" into Czech, I will follow these steps: 1.
