Article: There's no place in the world like Venice, Italy. Called the City of Water, Venice was built about 1,500 years ago. It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city. Because the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say. To keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati. Experts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \\"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice. Some of the world's greatest paintings can be found on the city's museum walls,\\" explains Melissa Conn, who is a director of Save Venice Inc. While scientists work to get their water-pumping plan approved, Venice's residents go about their normal routines. When the tide rolls in, the locals have ways of keeping everyone dry. Cafe owners move tables to higher ground, and hotels pass out high boots to guests. Still, dealing with the rising water does not give the city's residents a sinking feeling, just ask Erla Zwingle.

The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters.

As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first title in the series, \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every \\"Super Mario\\" game since. These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give Mario special magic powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into giant and miniature sizes. - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983.

In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A music box or musical box is an automatic musical instrument that produces sounds by the use of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or \\"lamellae\\") of a steel comb.

The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Solve 0*w - w - 5 = 0 for w.","response":"We have the equation 0*w - w - 5 = 0 to solve for w. To determine the solution for w, we need to isolate w from the equation. Let's follow the step-by-step process: 1. Simplify the equation: Since 0 multiplied by any number is always 0, we can eliminate the term 0*w, as it will not affect the result. This gives us the simplified equation: -w - 5 = 0 2. Move the constant term to the right side of the equation: In this step, we need to move the constant term (-5) to the right side of the equation. To do so, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: -w - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5 This simplifies the equation to: -w = 5 3. Isolate the variable w: Now we need to isolate the variable w. Since we currently have -w on the left side, we need to negate both sides to solve for w. We do this by multiplying both sides by -1: (-1) * (-w) = 5 * (-1) This simplifies the equation to: w = -5 So, the solution to the equation 0*w - w - 5 = 0 is w = -5."},{"question":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: SantMiquelcanbereservedonlyifthebookingstartdateisbetween31Dec2015-15Jan2016","response":"Santa Miquel can be reserved only if the booking start date is between December 31st, 2015 and January 15th, 2016."},{"question":"Data: Auburn, Washington, isPartOf, Washington (state); Washington (state), largestCity, Seattle; United States, capital, Washington, D.C.; Washington (state), country, United States; Auburn, Washington, isPartOf, King County, Washington Sentence about the following data:","response":"Auburn is a place inside a big area called Washington state, which is inside a country called the United States.

In particular, it informs us that Henry VIII had a wine cellar in the Palace, and also provides additional context such as the wine cellar's purpose and history. The following points from the sentence can be used to answer the question: 1. Henry VIII: The sentence begins by explicitly stating that the wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall belonged to Henry VIII, the former King of England. Hence, it directly answers the question concerning the owner of the wine cellar. 2. Built for Cardinal Wolsey: The sentence also mentions that the wine cellar was built in 1514–1516 for Cardinal Wolsey, a prominent English churchman and statesman during that time. This information is significant because it adds to our understanding of its origin and reveals that Henry VIII was not the original owner. Therefore, while Henry VIII possessed the wine cellar, it was Cardinal Wolsey for whom it was initially constructed. 3. Basement of Main Building: This sentence highlights the location of the wine cellar within the Palace of Whitehall.

Napoleon Bonaparte, having kept his guardians from killing the pair, exchanges his physicianâs services with Edmond for the delivery of a letter to a Monsieur Clarion. In Marseille, the company owner Morrell commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over First Mate Danglars, who gave Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba. Edmond states his intention to marry his girlfriend, MercÃ©dÃ¨s, whom Fernand lusts after. Fernand and Danglars inform on Edmond, concerning the letter Fernand saw Napoleon hand him, to the cityâs Magistrate, Villefort, who has Edmond arrested. Villefort prepares to exonerate Edmond until he learns the letter is addressed to his father, a Bonapartist; he burns the letter and orders Edmond locked up in ChÃ¢teau d'If. Edmond escapes, and turns to Fernand for help, but Fernand holds him up and turns him over to the pursuing gendarmes. Edmond is consigned to the island prison and its sadistic warden, Armand Dorleac.

Here are the reasons and steps I take to evaluate how this review affects my decision: 1. Identify the main concerns: The reviewer mentions that the first four episodes were a \\"rehash\\" of the original movie and the rest of the series was \\"predictable\\" with \\"nothing of value to raise it above\\" the original series. 2. Evaluate the credibility: The reviewer seems to have a good knowledge of the original series and the creator, which adds credibility to their perspective. 3. Consider the emotional language used: The reviewer uses strong negative language (e.g., \\"couldn't believe,\\" \\"raped,\\" \\"scam\\"), which suggests a strong negative reaction to the product. 4. Match concerns to personal preferences: While I may not have the same opinion about the series' predictability or the events that the reviewer disliked, it's essential to consider whether those aspects would bother me should I choose to watch the series. 5. Weigh the impact: Based on the review, it seems like a significant portion of the series may not offer a new or exciting experience. Depending on the importance I place on that aspect, this could have a substantial negative impact on my overall enjoyment of the product.

Shamiur Rahman, a 19-year-old American of Bengali descent, was paid up to 1,000 per month for snapping pictures inside mosques and collecting the names of innocent people attending study groups on Islam, he told The Associated Press.

This approach to monitoring the Muslim community shows an assumption by the NYPD that individuals might pose a threat based solely on their religious beliefs. As a result, many innocent people were targeted, and their civil liberties were infringed upon, exacerbating the existing divide between law enforcement agencies and the Muslim community. This surveillance program initiated by the NYPD raises concerns about the rights of religious minorities in the United States. It also highlights the potential for law enforcement to unfairly categorize and target people based on their beliefs, rather than evidence of criminal activity. The revelation of Shamiur Rahman's role as an informant deepened the mistrust between the Muslim community and law enforcement, as it demonstrates the lengths to which authorities are willing to go in order to gain information. This, in turn, may result in a reluctance by members of these communities to cooperate with law enforcement, hindering the authorities' efforts in fighting crime and terrorism. Moreover, the use of paid informants can be problematic from an ethical standpoint. By offering financial incentives to individuals willing to spy on their own communities and encourage others to express extremist views, law enforcement may inadvertently create a culture of deceit and betrayal. This undermines the very foundation of a community and fosters a climate of fear and suspicion. In conclusion, policies like the NYPD's internal terrorism watch list exemplify the risks inherent in targeting specific groups based on their religious or ideological beliefs. Rather than making communities and cities safer, such practices may contribute to a climate of distrust between law enforcement and the community they serve, ultimately hampering efforts to combat crime and terrorism effectively. It is crucial for authorities to strike a balance between upholding civil liberties and ensuring national security by focusing on individuals' actions, rather than their beliefs or affiliations."},{"question":"- eMule - совершенно бесплатная программа и при этом не содержит никаких шпионских или рекламных дополнений.

When Dunlap is killed in a private plane crash, his will calls for Brittney to receive a small stipend until she finishes college, after which she will receive only 25,000 a year for life from the estate. The rest of Dunlap's assets, totaling 70 million, are to be left to a corporate trust, unless a blood heir can be found. Brittney's brash, relatively poor classmate Maya (Leila Arcieri) suddenly claims to be Dunlap's illegitimate daughter as the result of her mother's extramarital affair. She is ordered by a judge to submit to a DNA test, the result of which proves she is Dunlap's child. At the Dunlap home, Brittney hears a noise on her way to the wine cellar but it turns out to just be rats. Suddenly Maya appears and the girls reveal they are lovers before being joined by Dr. Julian Haynes (Joe Michael Burke), who had arranged the DNA test. The trio are in cahoots, running a scam to secure and share Dunlap's fortune. Insurance investigator Terence Bridge (Isaiah Washington), investigating the circumstances of the plane crash, finds out from Dunlap's medical records that Dunlap had scarlet fever as a child, one of the side effects of which can be sterility, and asks Dr. Haynes how Dunlap could have fathered a child. Dr. Haynes gets nervous about the plot unraveling and contacts Maya. He agrees to meet her and Brittney that night at the docks, where Maya shoots him. The two girls dispose of his body in Gator Alley. After Bridge learns the entire affair was planned, he shows up at the Dunlap home and demands half the money in return for not going to the police.

BMW vehicles generally provide a more engaging driving experience compared to Mercedes cars. However, Mercedes-AMG lineup may compete with BMW M performance cars in terms of power and speed. b) Comfort: Mercedes vehicles are generally considered luxurious, providing a comfortable and quiet ride, while prioritizing the overall experience of the passenger. BMW cars may feature a sportier suspension setup, which could be slightly less comfortable than a Mercedes, but there are models like BMW 7 Series that prioritize comfort and luxury too. c) Design: Both brands have distinctive design language and aesthetics, with Mercedes often leaning towards more elegant and classy designs, while BMW focuses on muscular, agile, and sporty designs. Choosing a design between the two is subjective and depends on personal preferences. d) Reliability: In general, both Mercedes and BMW are considered premium brands, and the build quality and durability of their vehicles reflect this. However, the cost of maintenance and repair for these premium brands may be higher than for other car manufacturers. It is essential to consider the long-term cost of ownership when making a decision between the two. e) Technology: Both Mercedes and BMW have consistently been at the forefront of automotive technology. Mercedes has introduced innovative features like advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and the proprietary MBUX infotainment system. On the other hand, BMW has consistently improved its iDrive system, making it one of the best in the industry, and investing in electrification with the BMW i models. 2. Porsche vs. BMW vs. Mercedes-Benz: a) Performance: Porsche, with its sports car heritage, typically offers the most performance-oriented vehicles in this comparison. Cars like the 911 and Cayman are known for their exceptional driving dynamics, acceleration, and handling. However, the BMW M lineup and Mercedes-AMG lineup do offer competitive performance compared to their Porsche counterparts. b) Comfort: In this comparison, Mercedes-Benz would likely take the lead in terms of comfort, followed by BMW, and then Porsche. While Porsche has made strides in comfort over the years, their primary focus is still on performance and driving dynamics, which can sometimes compromise comfort and luxury. c) Design: Design preferences are subjective, but each brand has a distinctive design language. Porsche designs are more performance-focused and timeless, BMW features sporty and aggressive designs, and Mercedes-Benz showcases elegance and luxury. d) Reliability: All three brands are considered premium, and their vehicles generally boast quality craftsmanship and durability. However, it's essential to consider the cost of maintenance and repair for each brand, as they may differ. e) Technology: As premium car manufacturers, all three brands prioritize technology and innovation. Mercedes, BMW, and Porsche each offer advanced infotainment systems, driver assistance features, and electrification options. In conclusion, while both questions inquire about the comparison of car brands, the first question specifically asks for a comparison between Mercedes and BMW, and the second question compares Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. The better brand depends on personal preferences, and factors like performance, comfort, design, reliability, and technology should be taken into consideration when making a decision between these brands."},{"question":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: A group of people stand behind a master yogi. he","response":"expertly guides them through a series of challenging poses, demonstrating each one with precision and grace.

Most Britons would be happy to pay more tax to save the NHS, a new poll has found. Some 57 per cent of the public would be prepared to see taxes rise to protect the NHS, according to a new survey. Just over four in 10 voters said they would not. The revelation comes amid warnings that the NHS could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase spending. A clear majority of the public would be prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS, according to a new ComRes poll. All age groups are prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS - except 35-44 year-olds - including three in five Conservative voters and two-thirds of Labour supporters. The public also do not appear to care who provides their treatment - as long as it is free. Some 67 per cent said they did not mind if health services were run by the NHS or by privately owned businesses, provided it was free, while 30 per cent disagreed. A majority of Labour supporters - 59 per cent - say they do not mind who provides NHS services, with the working class least bothered of all. The research, carried out by ComRes for The Independent, also found that voters trust Labour more than the Conservatives on health issues, with 33 per cent backing leader Ed Miliband to protect the NHS, and 29 per cent trusting Prime Minister David Cameron. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: 'Beyond the economy and immigration, the NHS will be the key policy issue on which the 2015 general election is decided, and the fact that most Britons say they are willing to pay more tax in order to protect the NHS just goes to show the peril of being seen by voters to neglect it. 'Although traditionally it has been difficult for the Conservatives to get traction with voters on the NHS, voters seem to trust neither leader particularly to protect what is perceived as a valuable national institution.' Meanwhile, Labour's poll lead has dropped from five to two points since last month, ComRes found. Labour is on 32 per cent, down three points, the Conservatives are unchanged on 30 per cent, Ukip is up four points to 18 per cent, the Liberal Democrats are down one point to a record low of seven per cent. ComRes interviewed 1,005 British adults by telephone between June 27 and 29 to gauge public support for extra health spending and the use of private companies to deliver services. David Cameron is less trusted than Ed Miliband to protect the health service from cuts - but only just - according to the survey. The public's support for higher taxes to pay for the NHS comes after senior MPs said the health service could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase health spending. Over the weekend, former Conservative Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell called on David Cameron to boost the NHS budget as the economy recovered to avoid a crisis. He was joined by the new chair of the Health Select Committee, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who warned that it was 'hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service' if spending was not increased. Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, meanwhile said that the NHS needed an extra £15 billion over the next five years 'if you don't want the system to collapse during the course of the next parliament'. Labour is intending to make the the NHS a key battleground at the next election and has promised a 'big offer' on health care. It is considering three options to boost NHS spending: a ring-fenced rise in national insurance contributions for employers and workers; delaying the deficit-reduction programme and a budget increase once the nation’s books have been balanced. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure to increase the NHS's budget amid warnings that the health service is facing a financial crisis. As Chancellor, Gordon Brown raised National Insurance by one per cent in 2002 to help bring Britain’s spending on health up to the European average. Some Labour figures are wary that such a pledge now could undermine Mr Miliband’s 'cost of living' agenda as higher NICs would put more pressure on family budgets. But last night Labour supporters of a major health cash promise took comfort from the ComRes findings. Patrick Diamond, a former Downing Street policy adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said: 'These poll findings demonstrate there is a real appetite among the British electorate for higher taxes to ensure the NHS remains on a sustainable financial footing. 'The key policy issue is how to make NHS spending more transparent so voters know how well the extra money is being used, combined with measures that widen choice and control over services to maintain the public consensus for a universal, taxpayer-funded NHS.'

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person sleeps more happens, how will it affect less air is pushed through the vocal cords. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","response":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, we will break down the process into steps and determine if sleeping more affects any of the steps directly or indirectly: Step 1: Air is pulled into the lungs Sleeping more might cause a person to breathe more deeply and slowly, as slower breathing is typical of resting states. This could lead to an increase in the volume of air pulled into the lungs. But since breathing continues 24/7, even when asleep, the overall effect on this step is not significant. Step 2: Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream Oxygen transfer from the lungs to the bloodstream is a physiological process that continues during sleep. Sleeping more could potentially improve the efficiency of oxygen transfer, but it isn't directly affected by the amount of sleep a person gets. Step 3: Air is pushed through the vocal chords This step is directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. When a person sleeps more, they talk less. As a result, less air is pushed through the vocal cords. In turn, this will reduce the opportunities for speech. Step 4: A person talks Clearly, this step is affected by the perturbation hypothesis. Sleeping more means talking less, so there will be fewer instances of air being pushed through the vocal cords to create speech. Step 5: Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment This process continues throughout sleep, and is not significantly affected by the amount of sleep a person gets. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of a person sleeping more affecting less air being pushed through the vocal cords has a direct effect on Steps 3 and 4 (air being pushed through the vocal chords and talking) in the process, as a person will be talking less while they are asleep. It does not have a significant direct or indirect effect on the other steps in the process."},{"question":"\\"Which American TV director and producer who died in 1991 was responsible for 1960's TV shows such as \\"\\"Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea\\"\\", \\"\\"Lost In Space\\"\\" and \\"\\"Land Of The Giants\\"\\" ?\\" What is the answer?","response":"To find the answer, I will follow these steps: 1.

This is evident through several key phrases and aspects found throughout the review. Let's analyze the given information to understand why the sentiment is negative. 1. The title of the review states \\"not dependable.\\" This indicates that the reviewer does not find the product reliable or trustworthy, implying dissatisfaction with its performance or durability. The phrase \\"not dependable\\" is inherently negative in nature. 2. The reviewer comments, \\"It just didn't last.\\" This statement suggests that the product failed to meet the reviewer's expectations in terms of longevity or durability. The fact that it \\"didn't last\\" indicates the reviewer's disappointment in the product, which is indicative of a negative sentiment. 3. The next sentence, \\"Got a couple of years out of it but felt that for a brand name it should not have leaked,\\" reveals that the reviewer believes their expectations were not met. It is apparent that the reviewer expected better performance from a brand-name product and is disappointed that it started leaking after just a couple of years. 4. The concluding remark, \\"It became a throw away,\\" emphasizes the negative sentiment even further. Describing a product as a \\"throw away\\" indicates that the reviewer considers it to be of low quality and not worth keeping or repairing. This statement clearly portrays the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction and frustration with the product, which confirms that the sentiment expressed in this review is indeed negative. In summary, the product review conveys a negative sentiment due to the dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer regarding its dependability, longevity, and overall performance. Comments such as \\"not dependable,\\" \\"didn't last,\\" and describing the product as a \\"throw away,\\" clearly reflect the negative sentiment expressed by the reviewer."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Championship side Burton have re-signed Leicester City midfielder Hamza Choudhury on a season-long loan deal.

With a keen eye for breaking through opposition defenses and an unrelenting determination, Choudhury has the ability to control play and dictate the pace of matches.

A crowd of cheering protesters chanted \\"Good job\\" after the statue fell in Kiev's Bessarabska Square. Some pounded the monument with hammers, leaving pieces of the statue scattered on the ground. Only parts of the Soviet hero's legs remained at the base. A man waving a Ukrainian flag stood atop the pedestal beside them. Police said they were investigating but did not know know who had toppled the monument. Ukraine's government news agency said a lawmaker with the nationalist Svoboda party claimed responsibility for the incident. \\"This is the end of Soviet occupation,\\" the party's Twitter account said. \\"End of (the) regime of shame and humiliation.\\" Numerous statues of Lenin, one of the leaders of the 1917 Russian Revolution, have been removed from Kiev in recent years. The Communist Party decried the attack on the statue Sunday. \\"Destroying the Lenin monument in Kiev is not just an act of vandalism,\\" party leader Petro Symonenko said, according to a post on the party's official website. \\"It is a sign that organizers of the protests are not for the European values, but rather for hate, fear and destruction of the state of Ukraine.\\" The toppling of the statue on Sunday came as 100,000 protesters took to the streets of Kiev, according to police estimates, piling more pressure on Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych after he turned away from integration with Europe. Kiev suspended talks with the European Union last month, angering many Ukrainians who say an EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. The subsequent protests that have rattled the eastern European country are the biggest in Ukraine since the so-called Orange Revolution nine years ago, a populist movement that toppled the government. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Yanukovych on Sunday and told the Ukrainian president that he had \\"grave concern\\" about the situation, urging authorities not to resort to violence. Yanukovych told the U.N. chief that \\"consultations would be initiated to defuse the situation,\\" the United Nations said. Opposition leaders, who failed to force the government's resignation in a vote of no confidence in parliament last week, are counting on their supporters to voice their discontent. Demonstrators flocked to the capital's Independence Square, many camping out in freezing weather as they demanded the government's ouster as well as early presidential and parliamentary elections. Russia calls for 'stability and order' Others rallied outside the cabinet office, the presidential office and other government offices -- in some cases blocking the buildings and preventing employees from working. Tens of thousands of anti-government activists met at noon in Kiev for a rally organizers hailed as the \\"1 Million March,\\" hoping it would swell to 1 million people as the day went on. Ukrainian opposition leaders said close to half a million people were out on the streets. Police put the figure at 100,000. The crowd waved Ukrainian and EU flags and chanted slogans such as \\"Ukraine is Europe.\\" Some held pictures of Yanukovych's jailed chief political opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko. In statements posted on her official website, Tymoshenko called on supporters to keep up their demands. \\"I believe that you are strong, inspired and not retreat,\\" wrote the former prime minister, who ended a 12-day hunger strike last week, according to the Batkivschyna opposition party. \\"Be prepared for the fact that the struggle will be long and difficult, instant victory impossible. But professional and well-planned, your joint struggle has a chance to finish the victory.\\" Opposition demands. Demonstrators held a similar rally December 1. The daily protests have mainly been peaceful, but there has also been some violence, drawing condemnation from Western governments. The crowds often swell in size in the evenings as people leave work and join the protests. In speeches at the rallies, protest leaders have called for the government's resignation, the release of protesters arrested during clashes in Kiev, and the punishment of those responsible for using violence against demonstrators. \\"I appeal to the whole Ukraine, its East and West. The whole Ukraine must rise and declare a strike to this power in all cities and towns from tomorrow,\\" said boxer Vitaly Klitschko, an opposition leader, in a statement on the website of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party. Opinion: Why Ukraine's future lies with the EU, not Russia. Ukraine, Russian presidents meet. Against the backdrop of the anti-government protests, Yanukovych met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. The Ukrainian President traveled to China last week and had a work meeting with his Russian counterpart on the way back. \\"The two Presidents discussed current bilateral relations and preparations for the upcoming meeting of the Russian-Ukrainian Interstate Commission in Moscow,\\" an official statement from Putin's office said. One of the main reasons for Yanukovych's decision to backpedal on the EU talks is Russia's threat of trade sanctions and gas bill hikes. Yanukovych was also under pressure by the EU to free Tymoshenko. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office in 2004, when he was prime minister, also swept Tymoshenko to power. Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. The United States and Europe see the punishment as politically motivated. The battle over Ukraine: Towards a new geopolitical game. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"In Ukraine, protesters were very upset with their government because they wanted their country to become closer friends with countries in Europe, but their government decided to become closer friends with Russia instead. A big group of people got together and knocked down a statue of a famous Russian leader named Vladimir Lenin. This made some people happy because they felt it was a sign of breaking away from Russia, but it made others unhappy because they thought it was a bad thing to do. Many people have been protesting against the government's decision, and they want the people in charge of the country to change or leave. A lot of them are sleeping outside in very cold weather to show how much they care. They are also holding big meetings where they chant and hold signs. Some important people from other countries like the United Nations are watching the situation and telling the government to be careful not to hurt the protesters.

I went to Mr. Young and told him that the orphanage was going to send me to the big prison if I got another E on my report card.

How would you accomplish this goal? Pick your answer from: (I). Place the oreros in a food processor. Leave the lid open, and hit the pulse button over and over until you get your desired consistency. (II). Place the oreros in a food processor. Close the lid, and hit the pulse button over and over until you get your desired consistency.","response":"To accomplish the goal of crushing Oreos using a food processor, I would recommend following these steps, which align with option (II) from your proposed answers: 1. Preparation: First, ensure that you have a clean, dry, and functional food processor. Select the appropriate blade or disc attachment for your food processor if needed, typically a multi-purpose blade should work for crushing Oreos. 2. Quantity and pieces: The amount of Oreos you are crushing may also affect the end result. If you are crushing a large quantity, you may want to do it in smaller batches to ensure consistent texture and avoid overloading the processor. Moreover, gently break the Oreos into smaller pieces using your hands before adding them to the food processor. This will make it easier for the processor to break down the cookies. 3. Placing Oreos in the food processor: Add the Oreo pieces to the food processor, ensuring they are distributed evenly over the bottom of the container and not heaped to one side. Make sure not to overfill the food processor, and leave room for the blades to move freely. 4. Close the lid: For safety reasons and to prevent making a mess, ensure that the lid of the food processor is properly closed and locked in place. This will also create an enclosed environment, allowing the Oreos to be crushed uniformly. 5. Pulse the food processor: Turn on the food processor and start pulsing by hitting the pulse button over and over. By using the pulse setting, you can maintain better control over the texture of the crushed Oreos. Periodically stop pulsing to scrape down the sides of the container to make sure that all Oreo pieces are incorporated into the mixture. 6. Check for desired consistency: After several pulse cycles, check the consistency of the crushed Oreos. Depending on your preference or recipe requirements, you may want a fine powder, coarse crumbs, or larger chunks. Keep pulsing and checking until you achieve the desired consistency, but be careful not to overprocess, as this may turn the Oreos into a paste. 7. Transfer and store: Once you have reached the desired consistency, carefully transfer the crushed Oreos into a separate container or directly into your recipe. If you are not using them immediately, store them in an airtight container to prevent them from becoming soft or losing their crunchy texture. By following the above steps and ensuring the lid is properly closed during the process, you can achieve consistent and safely crushed Oreos using a food processor."},{"question":"Process: - The diaphragm contracts - The lungs expand - Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body - Question: suppose the red blood cells are defective happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body.

The man wanted to park the car in the garage but the","response":"garage was already occupied by an entire collection of antique furniture that he had inherited from his recently-deceased great-aunt Millicent. The pieces were diverse and beautifully-crafted, consisting of Victorian and Edwardian-era chairs, tables, cabinets, and paintings, among other stunning items. It was a treasure trove that evoked nostalgia, taking him back to the days when his great-aunt entertained guests in her sprawling ancestral home. He knew that he had to do something about the situation, as it was now becoming increasingly inconvenient for him to park his car on the road and deal with unpredictable weather conditions and potential vandalism. Moreover, he had to find a proper place for these elegant belongings before they started to succumb to undeserved neglect. After pondering his options, he decided to reach out to his older brother, Thomas. Thomas possessed a large garage that could easily accommodate both his car and at least a portion of the collection. He hoped that they could work out a temporary solution until a more permanent arrangement was found. Thomas, upon hearing of his brother's predicament, suggested a better course of action. He advised contacting a local antiques dealer specializing in period pieces, to gauge their potential worth and maybe sell the ones that wouldn't have a place in his house. The man took his brother's advice and invited two antique dealers to his home. The evaluation process began, and the man watched as they inspected his great-aunt's prized possessions down to the smallest details. The beauty of each piece shone through, stirring memories of his great-aunt's impressive storytelling and gracious hospitality. He found himself growing more attached to each piece, and the thought of parting with them became increasingly difficult. To his surprise, the antiques dealers concluded that the collection was quite valuable, with some pieces dating back to the 18th century. They informed him of the rich history associated with each item, and provided estimated financial values. At that moment, he realized he couldn't bear to sell the collection. While discussing the situation with his brother Thomas, an idea came to mind. Instead of selling the furniture, he would repurpose his basement as a cozy sitting room full of history and character, displaying the collection with pride. This solution would not only honor his great-aunt's memory but also provide an opportunity for future generations to witness and appreciate the antique furniture. Inspired by the idea, he immediately set to work on remodeling the basement. The dim and dingy space was soon transformed into a warm and welcoming haven, with each piece of furniture carefully arranged in a way that highlighted its unique beauty. The once-cramped garage now became a space where family and friends could gather to celebrate, relax, and create new memories. On the day of the remodel's completion, the man invited Thomas and his wife over for dinner to showcase his handiwork. They raised a toast to their great-aunt Millicent, who had managed to create a legacy of love and beauty in her collection that had now found a permanent home. The basement sitting room became a space filled with laughter, storytelling, and heartfelt connections, much like the home of the woman who first brought the furniture to life."},{"question":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"Hopefully when I mix these I'll still have eyebrows.\\" if \\"Person jumping up and down\\"?","response":"As an AI language model, I'll analyze the given information and try to form a conclusion based on the given relationship between the two statements.

Question: Who was the new country involved in the treaty in 1739 from 1718? Context: After the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718 the Treaty of Passarowitz confirmed the loss of the Banat, Serbia and \\"Little Walachia\\" (Oltenia) to Austria. The Treaty also revealed that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in Europe. The Austro-Russian–Turkish War, which was ended by the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739, resulted in the recovery of Serbia and Oltenia, but the Empire lost the port of Azov, north of the Crimean Peninsula, to the Russians. After this treaty the Ottoman Empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace, as Austria and Russia were forced to deal with the rise of Prussia.

However, it does not always mean that you are happy. A smile can hide other feelings, like anger, fear, or worry. In most countries, nodding the head up and down shows agreement, while shaking the head means that you do not agree, or that you would not like to do something. If you stand holding your arms across your chest, you may be protecting yourself---just from a conversation you do not want! If you sit looking at the person you are talking to and then turn toward to him, it shows that you are interested. If you roll your eyes and turn your head away, most likely you do not believe what you are hearing, or you do not like what you hear. Options: A he wants to protect himself from a conversation he doesn't want B he is very interested in the conversation C he is pleased with the man he is talking to D he wants to know more about the man he is talking to Answer: A he wants to protect himself from a conversation he doesn't want Question: Answer:","response":"Question: According to the article, what does it mean when a person stands holding their arms across their chest during a conversation?

Given the sentence \\"Asian man playing the guitar in an art studio.\\" can we conclude that \\"The man is paying the harmonica in a history museum.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"1. We start with the original sentence: \\"Asian man playing the guitar in an art studio.\\" 2. We know that the man is playing the guitar, so we can conclude that he is not playing the harmonica. If he is playing the guitar, it is not possible for him to be playing the harmonica at the same time. 3. The sentence states that the man is in an art studio, and not in a history museum. There is no information suggesting that he might be in a history museum, so we cannot assume that he is there. 4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\"The man is paying the harmonica in a history museum.\\" because both the instrument being played and the location are different from the given information.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The butterfly landed on the sun\\" - Sentence B: \\"The butterfly landed on the flower\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which of these sentences doesn't make sense, we need to analyze both Sentence A and Sentence B in terms of their content and logic. Sentence A: \\"The butterfly landed on the sun\\" 1. Butterflies are living creatures that cannot survive in the extreme heat and conditions of the sun. 2. The sun is a massive, hot, gaseous object located millions of miles away from Earth, making it impossible for a butterfly to physically reach it. 3. The concept of landing on the sun is inherently flawed, as there is no solid surface on which a butterfly could land. Sentence B: \\"The butterfly landed on the flower\\" 1. Butterflies are commonly associated with flowers, as they often visit them to collect nectar and contribute to pollination. 2. Flowers provide a natural and hospitable environment for butterflies. 3. The act of a butterfly landing on a flower is a common and plausible occurrence. Based on this analysis, Sentence A: \\"The butterfly landed on the sun\\" doesn't make sense, as the scenario it describes is impossible in terms of both the laws of nature and the limitations of the involved entities."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: Other aircraft too can generate a great deal of noise nuisance, certainly at major airports where many aircraft take off and land.","response":"Muut lentokoneet voivat myös aiheuttaa suurta meluhaittaa, erityisesti suurilla lentokentillä, joissa monet lentokoneet nousevat ilmaan ja laskeutuvat. Perustuen annettuun englanninkieliseen tekstiin, edellä mainittu lause tarkoittaa, että myös muut kuin tässä yhteydessä mainitut lentokoneet voivat aiheuttaa meluhaittaa. Tämä on erityisen totta suurilla lentokentillä, joilla on paljon lentoliikennettä ja useita lentokoneita laskeutumassa ja nousemassa ilmaan. Meluhaitta voi olla ongelma lentokentän ympäristössä asuville ihmisille ja se voi vaikuttaa heidän elämänlaatuunsa sekä terveyteensä. Monet lentokentät pyrkivät vähentämään meluhaittoja esimerkiksi määräämällä tiettyjä rajoituksia lentoliikenteelle, kuten rajoittamalla yöaikaista lentämistä tai käyttämällä meluvaimennustekniikoita. Tässä yhteydessä käytetyt meluvaimennustekniikat voivat sisältää esimerkiksi erityiset rakenteet, kuten meluesteet, jotka on suunniteltu vähentämään lentokoneiden aiheuttamaa melua. Lisäksi lentokentät saattavat vaatia lentoyhtiöitä käyttämään uudempia ja hiljaisempia lentokonemalleja, jotka aiheuttavat vähemmän melua. Myös lentoreittien ja -menetelmien muuttaminen voi auttaa vähentämään meluhaittoja. Kuitenkin on tärkeää muistaa, että lentoliikenne on olennainen osa nykypäivän yhteiskuntaa ja taloutta, ja se mahdollistaa ihmisten ja tavaran kuljetuksen nopeasti ja tehokkaasti ympäri maailmaa. Siksi meluhaittojen vähentäminen edellyttää usein kompromisseja lentokenttien ympärillä asuvien ihmisten elämänlaadun ja lentoliikenteen tehokkuuden välillä. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että muutkin lentokoneet voivat aiheuttaa suurta meluhaittaa, erityisesti suurilla lentokentillä, joissa monet lentokoneet nousevat ilmaan ja laskeutuvat. Meluhaittojen vähentäminen on monimutkainen haaste, joka vaatii erilaisten meluvaimentavien teknologioiden ja menetelmien käyttöä sekä jatkuvaa vuoropuhelua eri osapuolten, kuten lentokentän ympäristössä asuvien ihmisten, lentoyhtiöiden ja viranomaisten, välillä."},{"question":"If animals require a type of fluid to survive, then what requires a type of fluid to survive? Answer choices: - snail - wind - tapeworms - mussels - stones - animals - sand - Nematoda A:","response":"Let's analyze each answer choice step by step: 1. Snails: Snails are animals and require fluids to survive, particularly water to maintain their bodies' physiological processes and for their habitat. 2. Wind: Wind is a natural occurrence, not a living organism. It doesn't require fluids to survive. 3. Tapeworms: Tapeworms are parasites that live within host organisms, such as animals. As animals need fluids to survive, tapeworms are indirectly dependent on fluids for their survival. 4. Mussels: Mussels are mollusks, which are classified as animals. They live in aquatic environments and require water to survive. 5. Stones: Stones are inanimate objects, not living organisms. They don't require fluids to survive. 6. Animals: Animals, by definition, do require fluids like water for survival. 7. Sand: Sand is an inanimate object, not a living organism. It doesn't require fluids to survive. 8. Nematoda: Nematoda is a phylum of parasitic or free-living roundworms. As living organisms, they require fluids to maintain their bodies' physiological processes. From the answer choices given, the following require a type of fluid to survive: - Snails - Tapeworms - Mussels - Animals - Nematoda"},{"question":"Process: - Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl - Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter - Mix until smooth - Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high - Pour batter onto the griddle - Question: suppose the mother does not get an abortion happens, how will it affect more sugar is used. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"If a mother does not get an abortion, it means that she will continue with her pregnancy and eventually give birth to a child. This event by itself does not have a direct connection to the sugar content used in a pancake recipe. From the context you provided in the process, it seems that the question might be asking how using more sugar in the pancake batter would affect the outcome of the pancakes rather than the mother's decision about the pregnancy. In relation to the pancake recipe, the sugar content would have the following impact: A: More sugar: If we choose to add more sugar to the pancake batter, the pancakes would become sweeter. It might affect the taste, color, and texture of the pancakes. The additional sugar may cause the pancakes to brown faster due to the caramelization of sugar during the cooking process, giving the pancakes a darker appearance and potentially a slight crispiness on the outside. The sweetness of the pancakes may be too overpowering if too much sugar is added, and they may lose their intended balance of flavor. B: Less sugar: If we decide to use less sugar in the pancake batter, the pancakes would be less sweet. The decrease in sugar content could affect the browning of the pancakes. They might not brown as quickly or have that golden brown appearance that we typically expect from pancakes. The taste would be less sweet, and the texture might be lighter and slightly more dense. By using less sugar, the pancake’s flavor profile may lean more towards the savory side, depending on other ingredients used. C: No effect: If the amount of sugar in the pancake recipe remains the same and only the cooking method, such as the temperature of the frying pan or the griddle, is adjusted, it may not significantly affect the overall sweetness, texture, and browning of the pancakes. However, it is important to note that sugar content does play a role in the overall outcome of the pancakes. In conclusion, the mother's decision about her pregnancy does not have a direct impact on the sugar content of the pancake batter. However, changing the amount of sugar in the pancake recipe will have varying effects on the taste, appearance, and texture of the pancakes."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence.

Elderly residents intimidated by rowdy behaviour of two tenants. Managers called in 24-hour security guard at first to calm atmosphere. Now the guard's gone but residents are still said to be fearful.","response":"Title: Tensions Escalate at Birch Grove Over Christmas Celebrations: Residents Left Fearful The festive season at Birch Grove in South Tyneside took an unexpected turn as trouble began brewing over a disagreement about a Christmas tree. A seemingly innocent disagreement over holiday decorations quickly spiralled out of control, leaving elderly residents intimidated and fearful. Managers were forced to hire a 24-hour security guard, further complicating the atmosphere inside the community. The problems started at the small residential area, when two tenants engaged in rowdy behavior and caused outrage amongst the other residents. The primary issue seemed to stem from the placement and arrangements revolving around a Christmas tree. However, the tensions quickly grew beyond the festive dispute, turning into a bitter and dangerous situation. The elderly residents who live at Birch Grove pride themselves on a calm and secure environment. However, the episode left them distressed and alarmed. In an attempt to calm the situation and ensure the safety of all residents, the managers of the property decided to call in a private security company. A 24-hour security guard was stationed inside the compound to maintain order and offer a sense of security for the frightened residents. Despite the presence of the security guard, tensions remained high within the community. While most of the residents complied with the new security procedures and found comfort in the extra layer of safety, some occupants were unhappy with what they perceived to be a drastic reaction to the initial dispute. After the security guard's departure, the problem remained unresolved for the residents. Fear continued to linger within the community, causing elderly inhabitants to question their safety inside their supposedly secure living environment. The managers face increased scrutiny as they search for a solution that would put a definitive end to the discord and restore peace to Birch Grove. The unresolved situation at Birch Grove highlights the challenges that can arise within tight-knit residential communities, especially when disagreements spiral out of control. Instances like this emphasize the importance of cooperation, understanding, and communication amongst community members, especially as they strive to maintain an atmosphere that is comfortable and supportive for everyone who calls the area home. In conclusion, the troubles that began over a simple disagreement at Birch Grove have escalated into a far more complex situation affecting the safety, well-being, and harmony of the community. Dealing with such incidents requires a multifaceted approach – one that emphasizes the need for open dialogue and effective conflict resolution, without relying solely on the presence of a security service. For the residents of Birch Grove, it remains to be seen whether the managers will come up with a long-term and mutually acceptable solution to restore peace and security within the community."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: it is not possible to tell","response":"Question: Is it possible to determine the exact thoughts or emotions a person experiences when viewing an abstract painting? Justification: This answer suggests that it is not possible to tell because abstract art is highly subjective and open to individual interpretation.

As a result, it is impossible to determine the exact thoughts or emotions a person experiences since there is no objective truth in the interpretation of abstract art."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: Which place is Regret being returned to? New Orleans","response":"Title: \\"New Regrets in New Orleans\\" Step 1: Create the Basic Plot Given the title suggests regret and the location is New Orleans, the central theme can revolve around redemption and seeking forgiveness. The main character, let's call him John, returns to his hometown in New Orleans after a long stint away due to a heartbreaking situation that made him leave. His return is sparked by a mysterious letter he receives, convincing him to come back. Step 2: Develop the Characters John, our protagonist, was a talented but wayward youth involved in illegal activities in his past. Maria is John's past love and the main reason behind his regret and the uneasy past they share. A lovable and wise character could be Maria's grandmother, who acts as the catalyst for John's return. Step 3: Set up the Conflict The central conflict could be John's struggle to confront his past mistakes, make amends with Maria, and face his own guilt. He also gets embroiled with his past life as he gets targeted by his old opportunistic friends for their vested interests. Step 4: Progress the Story John's return to New Orleans triggers a chain of events: reconnecting with his old friends, discovering Maria is now a single mother to a child who is his, and inadvertently endangering them by his past actions. Step 5: Introduce the Climax The climax can occur when Maria's life is in danger due to John's past haunting them, forcing John to face his old allies. Maria, initially angry, realizes that John has changed and is trying to right his wrongs. Step 6: Conclusion John's actions ultimately redeem him in Maria's eyes, and he finally overcomes his regret by protecting Maria and their child, coming to terms with his past and working on building a future. The city of New Orleans serves as a backdrop that is initially a symbol of John's past regrets but transformed into a city of redemption and second chances by the end. This simple setup can allow for a captivating narrative where the city of New Orleans and its rich history and culture can play a pivotal role, resonate with themes of regret, redemption, and a chance to start anew - a story where past regrets are not only confronted but also embraced to pave the way for a new hopeful future.

Bettel's team was sworn in Wednesday. It will remain much the same as the outgoing government, with Socialist veteran Jean Asselborn holding on to his position as foreign minister and Pierre Gramegna as finance minister. The parties control 31 of the 60 seats in the Luxembourg legislature. ||||| Luxembourg is to become the first country in the world to scrap fares on all public transport. The plans, introduced by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel's coalition government, will see trains, trams and buses run free of charge from next summer. Bettel, who took office for a second term on Wednesday, made environmental protection a key part of his election campaign. His Democratic Party will form a government with the left-wing Socialist Workers’ party and the Greens. Currently, fares are capped at €2 for anything up to two hours of travel, which covers most journeys in the 2,585 km² nation. Luxembourg City, the landlocked country's capital, is home to around 107,000 but sees 400,000 commuters cross its borders every day to work, causing some of the worst congestion in Europe. Part of the cost for the initiative will be footed by removing a tax break for commuters. Luxembourg has previously shown it has a forward-looking attitude towards transport — over the summer, the government introduced free transport for young people under the age of 20. Secondary school students are also provided free shuttle services between their places of study and homes. ||||| Luxembourg to become first country to make all public transport free Luxembourg is set to become the first country in the world to make all its public transport free.

It is home to about 110,000 people, but a further 400,000 commute into the city to work. A study suggested that drivers in the capital spent an average of 33 hours in traffic jams in 2016. While the country as a whole has 600,000 inhabitants, nearly 200,000 people living in France, Belgium and Germany cross the border every day to work in Luxembourg. Luxembourg has increasingly shown a progressive attitude to transport. This summer, the government brought in free transport for every child and young person under the age of 20. Secondary school students can use free shuttles between their institution and their home. Commuters need only pay €2 (£1.78) for up to two hours of travel, which in a country of just 999 sq miles (2,590 sq km) covers almost all journeys. Now, from the start of 2020 all tickets will be abolished, saving on the collection of fares and the policing of ticket purchases. 'A special place for Luxembourgish': Grand Duchy's native language enjoys renaissance Read more The policy is yet to be fully thought through, however. A decision has yet to be taken on what to do about first- and second-class compartments on trains. Bettel only just scraped back into government in the recent election. Opinion polls before October’s poll had indicated that the Christian Social People’s party (CSV) – led for 19 years by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – would end Bettel’s five years as prime minister. The CSV, however, lost seats, while the Greens gained three seats. The result gave the coalition 31 seats in the 60-seat chamber. The policy of the new government that has caused the most debate, however, has been that of legalising the purchase, possession and consumption of cannabis for recreational use. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Luxembourg is set to become the first country in the world to make all public transport free. The plans, introduced by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel's coalition government, will see trains, trams, and buses run free of charge from next summer. The initiative aims to reduce traffic congestion and support environmental protection efforts. Part of the cost for this initiative will be covered by removing a tax break for commuters. The new government is also considering legalizing cannabis and introducing two new public holidays."},{"question":"This article: In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose monument says they died at 51?, what is it ?

Jennifer went directly to Victoria's house to ask for a divorce, but no one was there. pick from the following. [+] Jennifer was hiding.. [+] Victoria was hiding..","response":"Victoria was hiding. As Jennifer approached Victoria's house, she felt a myriad of emotions swirling around her - fear, anger, frustration, and heartache. She took a deep breath and told herself it was time for a divorce. With her husband, David, cheating on her, and with her now-former friend Victoria, it felt impossible to recover. And so, she found herself outside Victoria's house, seeking the closure she desperately needed. Unbeknownst to Jennifer, Victoria was hiding inside. She had already packed her bags and purchased a one-way ticket to put some much-needed distance between the disaster her life had become and the fresh start she hoped to find. Victoria felt a mixture of guilt and panic; she knew that her relationship with David had dealt a crushing blow to Jennifer - after all, they had been best friends for years. But Victoria saw no other way; she had fallen in love with David and thought it was too late to make things right with Jennifer. As Jennifer knocked on the door, a crippling silence answered. After a few more knocks, she realized that no one was going to open it. Feeling increasingly hopeless, she walked along the side of the house, hoping to catch a glimpse of someone inside. Meanwhile, Victoria watched her from the window, her pulse quickening, hands shaking nervously. She couldn't believe Jennifer was there, and she couldn't help but feel an overwhelming rush of shame and guilt. Jennifer felt a tear roll down her cheek as she peered through the window into Victoria's living room. She couldn't understand how her life had devolved into such chaos and heartbreak. Her only goal now was to move through the process of healing and find her way back to happiness. On the other side of the glass, Victoria's heart ached as she watched Jennifer's tear-streaked face. She knew that confronting Jennifer at that moment would only lead to more pain for both of them. After checking her watch and realizing that she needed to leave for the airport, Victoria decided to remain hidden and abruptly slipped away, leaving her house and her old life, forever. Jennifer stayed outside Victoria's house for some time, eventually realizing that no confrontation would happen that day. She allowed herself to cry, healing in the knowledge that both Victoria and David were no longer in her life. Hoping for a better future, she decided to visit a divorce attorney and gradually move forward. As Victoria took her seat on the airplane, she couldn't help but glance down at the pictures she had of Jennifer and David - memories of better days, happier times, and a friendship she knew would never be rekindled. As she switched off her phone, the guilt remained embedded in her chest, morphing into an invisible weight that she'd have to carry with her as she embarked on her new journey. In the months that followed, Jennifer focused on healing and laying the foundation for a new beginning. She invested in herself and her future, rediscovering forgotten dreams and reigniting old passions. While the pain caused by Victoria's betrayal would never fully disappear, Jennifer found solace in the knowledge that she had the resilience and strength required to create her own version of happiness. Victoria, on the other hand, struggled to find peace and happiness away from all the familiar comforts her old life provided. Her relationship with David, a destructive force, had left her uncertain of her own self-worth. As she started to rebuild her life, she couldn't help but wonder whether she'd truly find redemption and the forgiveness she so desperately craved. The future remained uncertain for both women, with only the echoes of the past to remind them of the friendship they had lost."},{"question":"This article: In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public.

A builder looking for wood to build a new home is most likely to visit a lumberyard because this is the location where various types and sizes of wood are readily available for purchase. Lumberyards specialize in supplying construction materials, including wood, to builders, contractors, and homeowners alike. Visiting one's own home would not be the ideal choice for the builder, as the home may not have the required quantity or type of wood necessary for constructing a new home. Additionally, using wood from one's home might weaken the structure or compromise its aesthetic appeal. A grocery store is not a relevant location for sourcing wood for construction purposes. While grocery stores may stock some basic household items and tools, their primary focus is on providing food and consumer products. Boats are not a sensible source of wood for building homes either. It is true that boats are often made of wood or have wooden components; however, dismantling a boat to obtain wood for constructing a house would not only be time-consuming and inefficient but it could also damage the boat beyond repair. Moreover, the type of wood used in boats may not always be suitable for residential construction. A carpet store would primarily sell carpets, rugs, and other flooring materials, not wood. While they sometimes offer a selection of engineered wood flooring or other wood-based products, such materials are more suitable for interior finishing rather than the structural needs of building a new home. In conclusion, when a builder needs wood to construct a new home, a lumberyard is the most appropriate choice amongst the provided options. Lumberyards can cater to various construction requirements by offering a wide range of wood products, suitable for different aspects of home building. This ensures that the builder can source all their wood needs efficiently and effectively in a single location."},{"question":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Adding coolant to your car helps keep the engine cool and happy. So, let's learn how to do it together step by step, just like counting numbers. 1. First, you wait for the car to get nice and cool, and don't touch it after driving. It's like letting a hot pizza cool down before you eat it. 2. Next, you find the hood release, which is like a secret button or lever inside the car by the driver's side, like a treasure hunt! Pull it, and the front part of the car (the hood) will start to lift up. 3. Now, go to the front of the car and find the safety latch under the hood to lift it all the way up. It's like lifting the lid of a big toy box! Make sure to use that special stick or support rod to help keep the hood open. 4. Look for a plastic container with a picture of water or a thermometer on its cap, like a secret potion bottle. This is called the coolant reservoir or overflow tank. Check the side of the tank, and you'll see markings like \\"minimum\\" and \\"maximum.\\" Remember, we want the liquid to be somewhere in between, not too low, but not too high. 5. Now, we get our magical potion - the coolant, also known as antifreeze. It's usually green, orange, or yellow, like the colors of a rainbow! Make sure to ask an adult to help you buy the right coolant for your car. 6. With the help of an adult, carefully open the coolant bottle and pour the coolant into the reservoir until it reaches the \\"maximum\\" line. Be careful, don't spill it, and avoid touching the liquid; it's not a fun potion to play with. 7. Once you're done adding the coolant, close the cap tightly on the reservoir, like closing the lid on a jar of cookies. 8. Finally, it's time to close the hood. Remove the support rod, lower the hood gently, and then give it a little push to close it, just like shutting the door of our toy cabinet. There you go! You've just added coolant to the car, and now it's ready to keep the engine cool and happy. Thanks for being a great little helper!"},{"question":"What happens next in this paragraph?

Know what you are looking for if you are shopping in the produce section.","response":"In the next part of this paragraph, the author would likely provide more tips and suggestions on how to save money at Whole Foods. Here is how it might continue: Consider shopping during sale events. Whole Foods often holds sales and offers promotions on various items. To maximize your savings, plan your grocery trips around these events. Buy in bulk for non-perishable items. Whole Foods has a bulk section for grains, nuts, and other non-perishable items. Buying in bulk can save you money, as it's usually cheaper per unit. Just make sure to store the items properly to prevent spoilage. Choose store brands when possible. Whole Foods' 365 Everyday Value brand is often less expensive than name-brand products. Opt for these items when you can to save without compromising on quality. Take advantage of the weekly sales flyer. Check the store's weekly sales flyer or visit their website to see featured sales items. Incorporate those items into your shopping list to save on groceries. Buy seasonal produce. Buying fruits and vegetables when they are in season is typically cheaper and provides fresher products. Make a habit of selecting seasonal produce to save on your grocery bill. Stick to a shopping list. Create a list of the items you need before heading to the store, and stick to it.

Options: - coins - baseball bat - coffeepot - watering can - carry object A:","response":"To answer this question, the main hint is \\"tool used to make plants wet\\". With this context, I will go through each option to see if it matches the given criteria. 1. Coins - Coins are a type of currency and do not hold water or moisten plants. This can't be the answer. 2. Baseball bat - A baseball bat is a sports equipment, used for hitting in games like baseball and softball. It also doesn’t fulfill the criterion of watering plants. So, this option is not correct. 3. Coffeepot - While a coffeepot can technically hold water, it is typically used for making and serving coffee, not for watering plants. This is probably not the answer. 4. Watering can - A watering can is used to water plants by scattering water over them. This aligns perfectly with the given scenario, making it highly likely to be the correct option. 5. Carry object - This is too general and doesn't specify anything about making plants wet. This also can't be the answer. After going through each option and matching them against the question's requirements, I conclude that the most suitable option is 'Watering Can'.

A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question \\"What does the Royal Family do?\\" would be as follows: The Royal Family, primarily consisting of the monarch and their immediate family members, plays a crucial role in both representing and supporting the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries as figureheads and symbols of continuity and stability. Their duties and activities can be divided into several categories. 1. Ceremonial and Public Duties: The Royal Family participates in numerous ceremonial events, such as the State Opening of Parliament, national celebrations, and other events, like the Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot, and the Remembrance Day Service. These events help to unite the nation by reminding citizens of their shared history, values, and traditions. 2. Charitable Work: The Royal Family members individually support hundreds of charities and organizations both in the United Kingdom and abroad. They often act as patrons, help raise funds, and bring public attention to the causes they support. The Queen, for example, is a patron of over 600 organizations, while The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, has established numerous charitable initiatives, including The Prince's Trust, which provides support for young people facing challenges in life. 3. Official Engagements: Members of the Royal Family undertake official engagements, such as opening ceremonies, visiting schools, hospitals, and military bases, as well as meeting foreign dignitaries, attending state functions, and participating in diplomatic missions abroad. These visits and engagements help to build relationships, strengthen communities, and promote goodwill between nations. 4. Supporting the Armed Forces: The Royal Family has strong connections with the UK Armed Forces, with several members having served or currently serving in various capacities. They honor the commitments of the armed forces, attend military ceremonies, and associate with relevant charities that support servicemen and women and their families. 5. Promoting British Interests: The Royal Family promotes British values, businesses, and trade interests both domestically and internationally. Members of the Royal Family often participate in trade missions and diplomatic visits, helping to foster business connections and open doors for British industries. In summary, while the answer provided in the question does touch upon the Royal Family's roles, it is not comprehensive or detailed enough to provide a clear picture of their duties and responsibilities.

Article: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me.

Movie title: Henry V Movie plot: The following story takes place during the 100 years' war between France and England. Henry V is debating whether he has the right to claim french territories under a property contract, presumably advocated by the clergy, between France and England at some prior date (citation needed).Prologue: Bear with us as we attempt to retell the story of Henry V at Agincourt, though our stage is an unworthy scaffold (a shallow representation) of the events which transpired before, during, and after.As the play unfolds, we see the clergy in a meeting about the king's seeming indifference of its claim --on technicality--to the french kingdom. There is a gathering of the king's subjects to hear details from the clergy as to why England has the right to claim the lands of the French. According to the clergy, by contract from previous encounters, the french must have a male heir, but at present have a female one, which effectually nullifies French royalty's claim to the french kingdom.The king warns the clergy to state the facts -- any other entreaty would lead to \\"much fall of blood,\\" which is expected due to the two contending kingdom's property. To be certain he is within his rights to claim french territories, he orders the clergyman to be blunt...does England have the right to make a claim of France?The clergyman says yes, and that if it is a sin, let it be on his head.Furthermore, the clergyman states that the winning back of such land would bring vast sums of money to the clergy. and King of England.

At the opening of his own restaurant, Joe leaves without Peyton, and is on the cover of a tabloid the next day. Stella decides Kingman needs a new fatherly image. At a later press conference, the reporters make Joe miserable, until Peyton comes to his defense, saying that he is new to this and trying the best he can, and that she thinks he is the best father in the world. Peyton then says that Joe has to repay her, so she has him take her to a ballet academy run by Monique Vasquez (Roselyn SÃ¡nchez).

Though the birth date differs slightly from the provided information, he is the most notable figure in the world of painting, drawing, and computer and video art who fits these criteria. Luc Tuymans' career began with his study of fine arts at the Sint-Lukasinstituut in Brussels, Belgium, and later, at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten (Royal Academy of Fine Arts) and the Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten (Higher Institute for Fine Arts), both in Antwerp. In the late 1980s, he gained international recognition for his distinctive painting style, which combined abstraction, figuration, and muted color palettes to create enigmatic and thought-provoking images. Over the years, Tuymans' work has been featured in prestigious museums and galleries around the world, including the Tate Modern in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. His paintings often draw inspiration from a variety of sources, including photography, film, and historical texts, and are characterized by their exploration of themes ranging from the oppressive nature of politics and power structures to the aftermath of colonialism and World War II.

Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

Now our equation is: -15 * p = 105 Next, we need to solve for p. Since we have -15 multiplied by p, we need to do the opposite, which is dividing, to figure out what p is.

Having children has its own unique set of joys and challenges that came with parenthood. And Samuel was about to experience yet another challenge: finding a reliable babysitter for his three rambunctious children on short notice. His regular babysitter had fallen ill, and with a significant business event to attend tonight, he couldn't afford to be late or absent. Samuel called up his best friend, Hunter, wondering if he had any recommendations. Although Hunter did not have children of his own, he happened to have a neighbor who was an experienced babysitter. He had heard good things about her abilities to manage and entertain children, and suggested that Samuel give her a try. Feeling somewhat wary, but with no other options, Samuel contacted the neighbor, who agreed to babysit his children. Elaine, the babysitter, arrived early, giving him time to discuss the usual routine, house rules, and emergency contacts. With a sense of relief, Samuel noticed her gentle demeanor, professionalism, and apparent competency in addressing his concerns. As Samuel prepared to leave for his event, he couldn't shake the feeling of uneasiness, that nagging voice in his head reminding him that he had never left his children with a stranger before. In an effort to reassure himself, he called Hunter and asked if he would be willing to pop over to his house later to check on Elaine and the kids, since they were already good neighbors. Grateful, Samuel headed off to his event, reminding himself that his children were resilient, and every new experience was an opportunity for growth. Meanwhile, at home, Elaine was quickly winning over the young ones with her genuine warmth, infectious laughter, and knack for storytelling. She discovered each child's unique interests and talents, engaging them in games, puzzles, and arts and crafts. True to his word, Hunter came by to visit them, and what he saw elated him. He found the children happily absorbed in their activities, laughing and enjoying their time with Elaine. They seemed to have formed an instant bond, much to his relief. When Samuel returned home that night, exhausted but satisfied with the outcome of his business event, he was pleasantly surprised to find his home in order, his children tucked into bed and fast asleep. Elaine presented him with a detailed report of their evening, complete with hand-drawn cards from the children, thanking Samuel for providing such an entertaining babysitter. Samuel felt a weight lift off his shoulders and thanked Elaine profusely, knowing she would be their go-to babysitter in the future. Not only did he find a solution to his immediate need, but he also discovered the value of trusting others and cultivating his own network of support, knowing that, sometimes, life would throw curveballs that he couldn't handle alone.

Clinton called for body cameras in every police department in the country, as well as an end to an “era of mass incarceration.” Her speech came two days after the funeral in Baltimore of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died while in police custody, and amidst ongoing civil unrest in that city. Read more: How Baltimore Police Lost Control in 90 Minutes “There is something profoundly wrong when African-American men are far more likely to be stopped by the police and charged with crimes and given longer prison terms than their white counterparts,” Clinton said. “There is something wrong when trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve breaks down … We must urgently begin to rebuild bonds of trust and respect among American between police and citizens.” Clinton offered few specific policy plans in the speech, and didn’t explain how police forces would pay for body cameras on all officers. She spoke broadly about reducing jail sentences for low-level offenders and the effects of imprisoning millions, particular African Americans. “We don’t want to create another incarceration generation,” Clinton said. Clinton planned Wednesday’s speech in November, months before she announced her candidacy, according to former New York mayor David Dinkins, who introduced her. In her three weeks as a presidential candidate, Clinton’s only major speeches have been at noncampaign events like today’s at Columbia University. Her comments were her most significant on domestic policing since she ended her tenure as Secretary of State in 2013. The police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last year sparked a nationwide debate about body cameras for officers, and subsequent police killings of black men caught on camera in New York State, South Carolina and Ohio have fueled calls for reform. Her remarks Wednesday reflected an evolution from the policing and incarceration policies that she supported in the 1990s, when as First Lady, she called for tougher prison sentences and “more prisons.” As President, Bill Clinton enacted a 1994 crime bill that built more prisons and increased the number of federal and death-penalty crimes, a bill that Hillary lobbied for in Congress. “We need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders,” Hillary Clinton said in 1994. “The three strikes and you’re out for violent offenders has to be part of the plan. We need more prisons to keep violent offenders for as long as it takes to keep them off the streets.” Clinton’s campaign objected to an earlier version of this story that said the former First Lady “rejected” President Bill Clinton’s tough-on-crime stance of the 1990s, when crime rates were significantly higher than they are today. “1999 and 2015 are two very different times,” said a campaign aide. “Crimes rates have dropped by 50%. Different circumstances require different policy solutions.” The violent crime rate in 1991 before Bill Clinton took office was 44.1 victims per 1,000 people, and rose to a 1990s high of 51.2 per 1,000 people in 1994 when Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law. But today, with violent crime rates having dropped to less than 20 per 1,000 people, many are calling for an adjusted approach towards crime. Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that federal money needed to be used to “bolster best practices” rather than equipping police with military equipment, and called for reducing the prison population. Her thinking reflects a broader evolution around the country, with politicians on both the left and the right backing ideas to reduce the prison population and change sentencing. Rand Paul, Chris Christie, the Koch brothers and many Democrats have also pushed for reform. The views Clinton expressed Wednesday aren’t new. In her first presidential campaign, Clinton called it a “disgrace” that “so many more African Americans” were incarcerated than whites, and as early as 2000 decried policing practices that appeared to target African Americans and Latinos. “Let us start by recognizing that crime is down dramatically — and lives have been saved in this city — because every day, brave men and women put on a uniform and place themselves in harm’s way to protect us,” she said in 2000. “And let us also recognize that far too many people believe they are considered guilty simply because of the color of their skin.”","response":"Title: \\"Hillary Clinton Advocates for Criminal Justice Reform: Addressing Police Brutality, Mass Incarceration, and Racial Disparities\\""},{"question":"Translate \\"Convertir granos troy en hundredweight métrica - masa convertidor\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"Alright, little buddy!

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Queen of the Damned Movie plot: The vampire Lestat is awakened from decades of slumber by the sound of a heavy metal band which he proceeds to take over as the lead singer. Achieving international success and planning a massive live concert, Lestat is approached by Marius, and warned that the vampires of the world will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile. Jesse Reeves, a researcher for the paranormal studies group Talamasca, is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, David Talbot, takes her aside and tells her they know he is and that a vampire called Marius made him. He also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and is now in the Talamasca library. In a flashback to his origins, Lestat recalls how he awoke Akasha, the first vampire, with his music. Jesse tracks him down to a London vampire club where he saves and confronts her. She later goes to Los Angeles for the concert and gives him back his journal. The two spend some time together and Lestat shows her both the horrors and the perks of being a vampire. Showing him that she's not scared of him Jesse stays with Lestat as she sees how lonely and miserable he is. She asks him to turn her as she reveals that it's her dream to be a vampire, but he refuses as he won't do it to her. The more time they spend together, the closer they become and soon Lestat and Jesse start to fall in love. Meanwhile, Akasha is awakened by Lestat's new music. She arrives and torches the club, and all the vampires inside, who want Lestat dead. At the concert in Death Valley, a mob of vampires attack Lestat and Marius. Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her as her new King. The two vampires then proceed to have a sort of sexual intercourse in Akasha's home where they mutually feed on one another, during which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her.

But officials on Monday said that it had been accessed independently and asked for the order to be withdrawn. Farook and his wife killed 14 in San Bernardino, California, in December. They were later shot dead by police. The FBI said it needed access to the phone's data to determine if the attackers worked with others, were targeting others and were supported by others. US officials said Farook's wife, Tashfeen Malik, had pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State on social media on the day of the shooting. Cracked iPhone: Should you be worried? Israeli firm linked to hacked iPhone UN human rights chief backs Apple Apple boss hits back at FBI conduct Last week, prosecutors said \\"an outside party\\" had demonstrated a possible way of unlocking the iPhone without the need to seek Apple's help. A court hearing with Apple was postponed at the request of the justice department, while it investigated new ways of accessing the phone. At the time, Apple said it did not know how to gain access, and said it hoped that the government would share with them any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light. On Monday a statement by Eileen Decker, the top federal prosecutor in California, said investigators had received the help of \\"a third party\\", but did not specify who that was. Investigators had \\"a solemn commitment to the victims of the San Bernardino shooting\\", she said. \\"It remains a priority for the government to ensure that law enforcement can obtain crucial digital information to protect national security and public safety, either with co-operation from relevant parties, or through the court system when co-operation fails,\\" the statement added. Responding to the move, Apple said: \\"From the beginning, we objected to the FBI's demand that Apple build a backdoor into the iPhone because we believed it was wrong and would set a dangerous precedent. As a result of the government's dismissal, neither of these occurred. This case should never have been brought.\\" The company said it would \\"continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated\\". The court case that had the US technology industry united against the FBI has for the time being gone away. Now this debate moves into more uncertain territory. The US government has knowledge of a security vulnerability that in theory weakens Apple devices around the world. To protect its reputation, Apple will rush to find and fix that flaw. Assuming it can do that, this row is back to square one. Therefore Apple has called for the matter to remain part of the \\"national conversation\\", while the US department of justice says it will still try to use the courts to compel Apple and other phone makers to help with future investigations. Row just beginning An Israeli newspaper last week reported that data forensics experts at cybersecurity firm Cellebrite, which has its headquarters in Israel, are involved in the case. Cellebrite told the BBC that it works with the FBI but would not say more. Its website, however, states that one of its tools can extract and decode data from the iPhone 5C, the model in question, among other locked handsets. The court order had led to a vigorous debate over privacy, with Apple receiving support from other tech giants including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. FBI director James Comey said it was the \\"hardest question\\" he had tackled in his job. However, he said, law enforcement saved lives, rescued children and prevented terror attacks using search warrants that gave it access to information on mobile phones. A summary of the above article is?","response":"Apple's battle with the FBI over accessing an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers is over, as the FBI found a third party to access the iPhone without help from Apple. Reports suggest Israel-based firm Cellebrite assisted the FBI in accessing the mobile phone but the company did not confirm the claims, only stating that it works with the FBI. Apple said that it had hoped the government would now share with them any identified vulnerabilities; the US Department of Justice has said it will still try to use courts to compel Apple and other phone makers to help with future investigations."},{"question":"next question: In Canada you'll hear most people doing what to converse?

In one example, artists Peng Yu and Sun Yuan tether four pairs of American pit bulls to eight wooden treadmills for a live exhibit. The dogs are faced off against one another, running \\"at\\" each other but prevented from touching one another, which is a stressful and frustrating experience for animals trained to fight. The dogs get wearier and wearier, their muscles more and more prominent, and their mouths increasingly salivate. At this live 2003 \\"performance\\" in China, a video was recorded, complete with close-up shots of the dogs' frantic, foaming faces. This 7-minute video will be on display at the Guggenheim exhibit (information from NY Times article \\"Where the Wild Things Are: China’s Art Dreamers at the Guggenheim\\"). In another example, artist Xu Bing stamped meaningless characters all over the bodies of two pigs, a boar and a sow, who were put on display, mating, in a museum exhibit in Beijing in 1994. The Guggenheim will feature the video of that \\"performance\\" as well. Finally, this exhibit will feature live animals (reptiles, amphibians, insects) that are trapped in a glass enclosure for attendee viewing. According to the NY Times article, \\"During the three-month exhibition some creatures will be devoured; others may die of fatigue. The big ones will survive. From time to time, a New York City pet shop will replenish the menagerie with new bugs.\\" Help us send a message to the Guggenheim by signing this petition. Let them know that animal cruelty holds no place in art in the United States, nor should it anywhere in the world. This assault on animals in the name of art will not be tolerated or supported. Guggenheim - please do what you know in your heart is right. Take a stand with our animal cohabitants of this planet, and pull the pieces employing these cruel methods from your upcoming show. Guggenheim - tell the world what you stand for: bold, controversial art that breaks barriers and challenges social norms, which does NOT include the promotion of cruelty against innocent beings. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain.

In the given text, it is clear that the narrator is amazed at how well this man seems to understand her thoughts and feelings, despite having just met. It seems as if he has an uncanny ability to know exactly what she would think or say, even when discussing specific subjects or addressing her questions and feelings. This creates an air of intrigue and wonder, causing the narrator to question whether this man could truly be a mind reader or if this could be the beginning of a romantic relationship. Though the text does not mention the man being particularly handsome (option a), it does emphasize his unique ability to know key details about her. Furthermore, the text does not provide enough evidence to confirm the man as a mind reader (option c). Option b) is an all-encompassing choice that disregards all other options and is therefore objectively invalid.

Became known for eccentric disguises, logical reasoning and crime figures. Now, investigator has been revealed as possible inspiration behind Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's hero featured in four novels and 56 short stories. Detective most recently portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in BBC series. Article:","response":"Title: \\"Jerome Caminada: The Unsung Hero Behind Sherlock Holmes\\" In the heart of the industrial city of Manchester, a distinctive figure emerged in the late 19th Century, whose detective skills dazzled and mystified its citizens. This figure was none other than Jerome Caminada, who rose to prominence due to his extraordinary crime-solving abilities. Caminada was not just a detective; he was a showman, known for his eccentric disguises, logical reasoning, and an uncanny ability to cut down crime figures. Step One: Introduction to the protagonist Jerome Caminada's life was anything but ordinary. His career as a detective combined a rigorous analytical mind with a flair for the dramatic, captivating Manchester’s people with each case he solved. Step Two: Establishing his skills Caminada’s use of eccentric disguises showcased not only his creativity but a deep understanding of human psychology; by adopting various appearances, he could infiltrate diverse groups, thereby gaining crucial evidence that otherwise might have remained elusive. But it was his logical reasoning that truly differentiated him from his peers. His approach to deduction was very astute, breaking down the most complex crimes to their bare essentials, leading to actionable and often groundbreaking insights. Step Three: Connection to Sherlock Holmes Fast forward to today, and this extraordinary investigator has been revealed as a possible inspiration for one of the greatest fictional detectives in literature - Sherlock Holmes. Step Four: Contextualizing Sherlock Holmes The iconic character penned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has been featured in four novels and 56 short stories, captivating readers across generations with his deductive reasoning, observational skills, and enigmatic personality. Indeed, parallels could easily be drawn between Caminada's and Holmes’s methods: their penchant for disguises, their deep reverence for logic and reasoning, and their ability to transform complex crime figures into understandable narratives. Step Five: Link to modern portrayals of Sherlock The timeless allure of Sherlock Holmes has also translated successfully onto the silver screen with many reincarnations, most recently portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in the critically acclaimed BBC series. Cumberbatch's portrayal, much like Caminada’s real-life exploits, is a mix of eccentricity, sharp intellect, and a knack for solving crimes that seems to border on the supernatural. Step Six: Conclusion and final thoughts Thus, in Jerome Caminada we find a rare combination of showmanship, intellect, and detective prowess that not only made him a legend in his time but continues to influence popular culture. Unveiling Caminada as a potential muse for the renowned Sherlock Holmes magnifies the significance of his contributions to criminology and detective work. Today, this unsung hero is finally being recognized and celebrated for his role in shaping one of the most iconic figures in the realm of mystery and detective fiction. With this article, Caminada's reputation steps out of the shadows of history wherein he has too long resided, allowing his legacy to be fully appreciated by the generations that followed. His spirit, it seems, lives on not only in the annals of Manchester’s past but also the pages of Doyle's thrilling narratives, continuing to captivate minds worldwide."},{"question":"Which is this about? Violence erupted again yesterday in Port-au-Prince, one day after three policemen were killed in a clash with protesters demanding the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.","response":"The situation in Port-au-Prince has been volatile, with violence erupting once again following the recent incident involving the death of three policemen during a clash with protesters. These demonstrations have been driven by the growing unrest and demands for the return of the ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in a coup. To properly understand the situation, it is essential to delve deep into the historical background, the role of the government and armed forces, as well as the international actors involved in shaping the current political climate in Haiti. Haiti's political history has been plagued by instability and violence, with numerous cases of political unrest, coups, and foreign interventions. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a former Roman Catholic priest, was initially elected as the President of Haiti in 1990 but was overthrown in a coup just a year later in 1991. He was then restored to power in 1994 with the help of the United Nations and the United States, serving the remainder of his term until 1996. Aristide was once again elected in 2000 and served until 2004, when he was ousted for the second time amidst allegations of corruption, human rights abuses, and election fraud. The current violence in Port-au-Prince can be traced back to the persistent dissatisfaction among the Haitian population with the government's inability to address the country's ongoing political and socio-economic challenges. Haiti has the lowest Human Development Index in the Americas, with a majority of its population living in extreme poverty, widespread unemployment, and a lack of access to basic services such as healthcare and education. Despite the efforts of numerous administrations, the nation has struggled to establish a stable, democratically-elected government that can efficiently address these issues. The continuous reliance on foreign aid and presence of peacekeeping missions exemplify the struggles of the country to maintain order and security on its own. In this context, the demand for the return of President Aristide, who has had a controversial history but still enjoys significant support from portions of the Haitian population, is seen as a symbol of hope and change by his supporters. Moreover, tensions between the Haitian population and the national police force have escalated in recent years. Allegations of police brutality, corruption, and the inability to maintain law and order, have fueled the growing resentment of the public. The deaths of the three policemen in this recent clash have further exacerbated the situation, creating a potentially dangerous and explosive environment. The international community's reaction to these events has been mixed. On one hand, organizations like the United Nations have called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis and a return to democratic processes. On the other hand, some nations that were previously involved in Haiti, such as the United States, have been cautious in their support for Aristide's return, considering the controversy surrounding his previous terms as President. In conclusion, the recent unrest and violence in Port-au-Prince are a result of the culmination of long-standing political, economic, and social grievances within the Haitian population, with the demand for the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide at the forefront. The volatile relationship between the citizens and law enforcement, combined with the ongoing struggle to establish a functioning and stable government capable of addressing the needs of the people, continues to fuel the current tensions in Haiti. It is up to the Haitian government, and perhaps the international community, to find a peaceful solution to these issues and work towards a better future for the nation."},{"question":"Q:Given the following context: Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907?

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"First, let's find out the total number of tickets. Total number of tickets = number of rolls × tickets per roll Total number of tickets = 30 × 100 Total number of tickets = 3000 Now let's find out how many tickets were bought by each grade. 4th grade = 30% of total tickets 4th grade = 0.30 × 3000 4th grade = 900 Subtracting the number of 4th-grade tickets from the total will give us the remaining tickets. Remaining tickets = total tickets - 4th-grade tickets Remaining tickets = 3000 - 900 Remaining tickets = 2100 5th-grade students bought 50% of the remaining tickets. 5th grade = 50% of remaining tickets 5th grade = 0.50 × 2100 5th grade = 1050 Subtracting 100 tickets of the 6th-grade from the remaining tickets, we get: Remaining tickets after 6th grade = remaining tickets - 6th-grade tickets Remaining tickets after 6th grade = 2100 - 100 Remaining tickets after 6th grade = 2000 Now subtracting the total number of tickets bought by 4th and 5th graders from the remaining tickets after the 6th grade, we get: Unsold tickets = remaining tickets after 6th grade - (4th grade + 5th grade) Unsold tickets = 2000 - (900 + 1050) Unsold tickets = 2000 - 1950 Unsold tickets = 50 So, 50 tickets were left unsold."},{"question":"In this task, you are given music product reviews in Japanese language.

In 1860 , Bouch designed the first British standard gauge locomotives to use a 4 - 4 - 0 wheel layout which had earlier become popular in the United States . - On a steam locomotive, a trailing wheel or trailing axle is generally an unpowered wheel or axle (wheelset) located behind the driving wheels. The axle of the trailing wheels is usually located in a trailing truck. On some large locomotives, a booster engine was mounted on the trailing truck to provide extra tractive effort when starting a heavy train and at low speeds on gradients. - George Stephenson (9 June 1781 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer who built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. Renowned as the \\"Father of Railways\\", the Victorians considered him a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement, with self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praising his achievements. His rail gauge of , sometimes called \\"Stephenson gauge\\", is the standard gauge by name and by convention for most of the world's railways. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, two powered driving wheels on one axle and no trailing wheels. This type of locomotive is often called a Jervis type, the name of the original designer. Overview. The wheel arrangement type was common on United States railroads from the 1830s through the 1850s. The first to be built was the \\"Experiment\\", later named \\"Brother Jonathan\\", for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad in 1832. It was built by the West Point Foundry based on a design by John B. Jervis. Having little else to reference, the manufacturers patterned the boiler and valve gear after locomotives built by Robert Stephenson of England. A few examples of Stephenson locomotives were already in operation in America, so engineers did not have to travel too far to get their initial ideas. - Shildon is a town in County Durham, in England. The population taken at the 2011 Census was 9,976. It is situated south east of Bishop Auckland, north of Darlington, from Durham, from Sunderland and from Newcastle upon Tyne. Shildon is part of the Bishop Auckland parliamentary constituency, which has been represented since 2005 by Helen Goodman MP for the Labour Party. - The Whyte notation for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte, and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in \\"American Engineer and Railroad Journal\\". The notation counts the number of leading wheels, then the number of driving wheels, and finally the number of trailing wheels, groups of numbers being separated by dashes. Other classification schemes, like UIC classification and the French, Turkish and Swiss systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels. - Middlesbrough is a large industrial town on the south bank of the River Tees in North East England, founded in 1830. The local council, a unitary authority, is Middlesbrough Borough Council. In 2011 it had a total resident population of 138,400 for the borough and 174,700 for the wider Middlesbrough built-up area subdivision, which itself is part of the larger built-up area of Teesside and had an overall population of 376,333 at the 2011 census. - The standard gauge (also Stephenson gauge after George Stephenson, International gauge, or normal gauge) is a widely used railway track gauge. Approximately 55% of the lines in the world are this gauge. All high-speed rail lines (except those in Russia, Uzbekistan, and Finland) are standard gauge. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be (except in the United States, where it is still defined in Imperial and US customary units as ).

The wheel arrangement is known as a Porter. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, represents the arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, usually in a leading bogie, four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles, and no trailing wheels. Almost every major railroad that operated in North America in the first half of the 19th century owned and operated locomotives of this type. Due to the large number of the type that were produced and used in the United States, the is most commonly known as the American type, but the type subsequently also became popular in the United Kingdom, where large numbers were produced. Overview. The first use of the name \\"American\\" to describe locomotives of this wheel arrangement was made by \\"Railroad Gazette\\" in April 1872. Prior to that, this wheel arrangement was known as a \\"standard\\" or \\"eight-wheeler\\". This locomotive type was so successful on railroads in the United States of America that many earlier 4-2-0 and 2-4-0 locomotives were rebuilt as 4-4-0s by the middle of the 19th century. - The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863. The world's first public railway to use steam locomotives, its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington, and was officially opened on 27 September 1825. The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business, and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough. While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start, passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833.

I had to show them I wasn't crazy. As the hours passed, I was shown to a blank room with plastic sheets and plastic pillows, which caused me to wonder what kind of distant confused souls had been imprisoned in this sterile place. There were bars on the windows and the only door out of the unit was locked 24/7. I knew my only refuge for the time being would be through the hour a day art therapy class and the smoke breaks I could take at will. They had given me a legal pad after my parents had told them of my affinity for writing. With it I set to work on the flow of words and the river of thoughts, both dark and hopeful that careened through my tired mind. Instead of sleep, I would write. I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went. Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out.

Now, over ten years later, they're using their flip flop business to help other orphans. The boys had an unusual childhood. They were just 11 and 13 when their parents, Kevin and Sandra, took them out of the UK education system and moved the family to Goa in India. Their parents were of the philosophy that they would receive a healthier and fuller education by traveling the world and helping others. There they did lots of voluntary work and mixed with the local community. It was when the family were on holiday in Sri Lanka that the tsunami hit. Although the children managed to escape, their parents tragically couldn't. But Paul says their upbringing meant they were able to cope with this tough blow. \\"Our parents gave us this confidence that we could do anything, that nothing was hard to achieve,\\" says Paul. What the boys did was to start a business selling ethically-sourced sandals. They're called 'Gandys' after the father of India's independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi. \\"He was in all our schoolbooks as kids; he's on all the money over in India; he's famous for wearing his flip flops,\\" says Paul. The entire project was inspired by their parents' philosophy, their globetrotting childhoods and what happened to them in Sri Lanka. Their parents had previously worked in the fashion industry before quitting their jobs and focusing on humanitarian projects. Thus, Gandys is a very fitting tribute to their lives. Gandys sells flip-flops and donates 10 percent of the profits from every pair sold to orphans around the globe. In conjunction with Gandys, the Forkans also founded Orphans for Orphans, a charitable organization dedicated to helping orphans. They say they can make a profit and do good at the same time: they give 10% of their profit to charity, and have set up their own foundation through which they've been able to open a children's home in Sri Lanka.

Nelson had always been a loyal friend, and the presence of someone he trusted would provide immense reassurance and comfort for Ian while he faced a potentially life-altering procedure. Step 1: Understand Ian's reasons for wanting Nelson at the hospital Ian's desire for Nelson's company during this difficult period in his life reflects the strength and importance of their friendship. By analyzing their bond, it becomes clear that Nelson's presence would be invaluable in providing support and stability as Ian faces the uncertainties of his surgery. Step 2: Establish the significance of the surgery Ian's surgery for colon polyps is a major medical event. It can be potentially life-altering and might involve some recovery time and complications.

The original statement contains several pieces of information: 1. A young man: This refers to the subject or main character involved in the scenario. In this case, it is a young man. 2. Is enjoying: This verbal phrase is used to describe the action or activity that the young man is participating in. \\"Enjoying\\" suggests that the young man is taking pleasure in the activity and is actively engaged in it. It also implies that the activity involves consumption or use of something. 3. A salad: This part of the statement identifies the object of the young man's enjoyment. The word \\"salad\\" is a type of dish predominantly consisting of a mixture of various vegetables or fruit, often containing a dressing or toppings. In the context of this statement, \\"salad\\" is the item being consumed by the young man. 4. For dinner: This prepositional phrase provides additional information about the context of the event. \\"For dinner\\" indicates that the young man is enjoying his salad as part of his evening meal. 5. In his home: Lastly, this prepositional phrase identifies the location where the young man is enjoying the salad. \\"In his home\\" suggests that he is in a familiar, comfortable, and private environment.

What was written in 4th century BCE? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"While the exact content of architectural writings from the 4th century BCE may not be specifically known or preserved, it is important to understand the context of architectural development during this period in various parts of Asia. This will shed light on the kind of architectural knowledge and practices that may have influenced the writings of the time. One possibility regarding architectural writings from the 4th century BCE could be related to the development of Chinese architecture, mentioned in the context of the Kao Gong Ji. The Kao Gong Ji is one of the earliest known documents on Chinese architecture and classic works of art from the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE). The architectural principles and techniques identified in this document may have been refined or expanded upon during the 4th century. Knowledge of building wooden structures, use of bricks, and implementation of religious and landscape structures like pagodas and gardens were likely a part of these Chinese texts. In ancient India, the Shilpa Shastras were treatises dealing with the science of art and architecture, and were developed over several centuries, beginning from the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE). The 4th century BCE was around the time of the Maurya dynasty in India, under which urban planning, public buildings, and palaces flourished with well-defined principles. As a result, the architectural writings of this period may have focused on temple architecture, urban planning, and palace design, incorporating geometry, proportion, and symbolism. The Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra, a treatise on architecture in ancient Sri Lanka, has its roots in prehistoric times and is believed to have emerged around the 3rd–1st century BCE. Architectural writings from the 4th century BCE in the region likely dealt with aspects such as sacred geometry, space planning, and construction techniques inspired by Indian Shastra traditions. Additionally, outside of explicit written texts, we should also consider the architectural knowledge and advancements during the 4th century BCE in other regions of Asia, such as Persia and Greece. The Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE) in Persia was well-established at this time, and significant architectural feats like the city of Persepolis provide a framework for the potential architectural concepts being discussed or documented during that period. Similarly, the influence of the Hellenistic period in Greece (323–31 BCE), during which architecture flourished, may have been captured in the architectural writings in Asia as new ideas and styles made their way between cultures. In summary, although specific architectural writings from the 4th century BCE may not be directly known, the advancements and trends in the architecture of that time suggest discussions around principles of construction, urban planning, temple architecture, and evolving design in relation to the different cultures and regions within Asia."},{"question":"2 Kennith Ullom from Philippines DLL Suite helped me solve my blue screen Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64bit issue today At first I thought the system Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64bit is crashed so I turned to DLL Suite Well I can only say Problem Solved hah hah Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","response":"2, Kennith Ullom from the Philippines: DLL Suite helped me solve my blue screen Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64-bit issue today.

Mister Quaker oddly jogs through the house to see Ossi on the other side of the mansion. When Mister Quaker peeps in, Ossi throws newspapers at him. He asks, Why are you throwing those newspapers? and the brat replies with, Because all of the vases are broken. Ossi is clearly angered, and in a big mess. She shows her father a newspaper that says the Shoe cream kings daughter has married to a count. This is what Ossi is upset about. Mister Quaker is not impressed but tells Ossi that he will buy her a prince. With this, Ossi cant contain herself, jumps up, and hugs her dad ever so enthusiastically. She is so happy, she could smash the house with joy! We then meet Seligson, the matchmaker, who is dealing with a woman with a turned up nose. She complains about the price and how all of the bachelors have imperfections. She then leaves unsatisfied. As she exits, Ossi enters the room smiling and hands the matchmaker a note from Mister Quaker. It says, that because of the shoe cream kings daughter is married, and because oysters are more important, then his daughter should be married too. She needs a man with a family tree that is in accordance with the Oyster kings. The matchmaker searches his wall full of bachelors and comes across Prince Nucki. Nucki lives high up in a building on the 47th floor, he has heavy debts, and is not inclined to marriage. With the great match, the matchmaker leaves instantly.

In law and government, de jure (; , \\"in law\\") describes practices that are legally recognized by official laws. In contrast, (\\"in fact\\" or \\"in practice\\") describes situations that are generally known to exist in reality, even if not legally authorized. The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios, for example, \\"I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it’s a de facto swimming pool\\". It is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (\\"de jure\\") legalities, possibly none of which is in force (\\"de facto\\"). After seizing power in 1526, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi made his brother, Umar Din, the lawful (\\"de jure\\") Sultan of Adal. Ahmad, however, was in practice (\\"de facto\\") the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead. Between 1805 and 1914, the ruling dynasty of Egypt ruled as \\"de jure\\" viceroys of the Ottoman Empire, but acted as \\"de facto\\" independent rulers who maintained a polite fiction of Ottoman suzerainty. However, from about 1882, the rulers had only \\"de jure\\" rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British puppet state. Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law \\"de jure\\" a province of the Ottoman Empire, but \\"de facto\\" was part of the British Empire. 1. What is the topic of conversation? 2.

The topic of conversation is the distinction between de jure and de facto in law and government, and how they were used to describe situations in historical contexts involving the Sultanate of Adal and Egypt. 2. There is no specific practice being discussed in the text. Rather, the differentiation between de jure (legally recognized) and de facto (existing in reality) situations is highlighted. 3. According to the text, Adal's de jure Sultan was Umar Din, who was made the Sultan by his brother, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, after taking power in 1526. 4. In practice, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi was the de facto Sultan of Adal, as he was the actual wielder of power, whereas his brother, Umar Din, served as a figurehead. 5. Egypt ruled as de jure viceroys of the Ottoman Empire between 1805 and 1914. 6. Egypt fell under Ottoman law during that time, as they were technically a province of the Ottoman Empire. 7. De jure and de facto are used to contrast different scenarios, as demonstrated by the examples in the text. They highlight the difference between what is legally recognized and the actual reality of a situation. 8. Egypt had a relationship with Britain where it became a British puppet state around 1882, ultimately having only de jure rule over Egypt and being controlled by the British Empire in practice. 9.

None of the above choices .. 4). It is before a major toy release .. Answer the following question: Why is the store so crowded ?","response":"The store is so crowded primarily because it's three days before Christmas. There are several reasons why an increased number of people tend to visit department stores during this period, making it one of the busiest shopping times of the year. 1. Holiday Shopping: One of the primary reasons for the crowd is that most people are at the store to shop for Christmas gifts for their loved ones. They want to find the perfect presents that will make their friends and family members happy. As a result, they flock to department stores to browse through the numerous products available and find items that suit their preferences and budgets. 2. Last-minute Shopping: Since the visit happened just three days before Christmas, it is highly likely that many customers are last-minute shoppers. Some people may have procrastinated or been unable to find the time to shop earlier, and now they're rushing to purchase everything they need. This influx of last-minute shoppers significantly contributes to the increased foot traffic inside the store. 3. Discounts and Promotions: During the holiday season, department stores often offer various discounts and promotional offers on their products to entice customers. Shoppers take advantage of these deals, resulting in more people visiting the store. Some consumers may even be on a hunt for the best deals, comparing items and prices across different stores to find the best bang for their buck. 4. Festive Atmosphere: The festive atmosphere in and around the store, with its eye-catching decorations and cheerful music, can also contribute to the large crowds. This environment can make shopping more enjoyable and draw people in who want to immerse themselves in the holiday spirit while they complete their gift-buying. 5. End-of-year Sales: Additionally, the end of the year is approaching, which means many people are shopping to make use of their remaining budgets, gift cards, or vouchers. They want to ensure they spend these funds before they expire or are no longer valid in the following year. In conclusion, the store's crowdedness can be attributed to the combination of several factors, including the approaching Christmas holiday, last-minute shopping, attractive discounts and promotions, the festive atmosphere, and end-of-year sales. This creates the ideal environment for people to flock to department stores, resulting in large crowds."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom.

But parents are usually the ones buying the phones. According to a July 2012 study, 56% of parents of children aged 8 to 12 have given their children a cellphone. The number goes up with age. The study just proves what many people already guessed: many kids, if not most, have their own cellphones. According to a recent survey, 12 is the magic number. It is the most common age for kids to get their first cellphone. But 13% of children aged 6 to 10 already have one. People who are for kids' using cellphones, including many parents, notice that cellphones help kids keep in touch with their friends and families. They believe that cellphones are an important tool in a dangerous situation. Kids can reach their parents at all times. And some people say having a cellphone helps teach kids to be responsible. Some cellphones designed for kids can be set to only work when parents approve . What's the harm in that? But other people are worried about the health and safety effects of kids' cellphones. They believe that kids with cellphones will spend less time playing outside with friends, and that sending text messages or making phone calls while doing homework makes it difficult for kids to concentrate. They say that kids are spending too much time texting instead of talking to each other. \\"Our brains developed to communicate face to face,\\" says Gary Small, a teacher at the UCLA School of Medicine, in California. \\"A lot of this is lost with texting.\\" Another worry is cyber bullying , which is on the rise as more kids use e-mail and text messages to communicate.

Her team scored twice at many points at their last home game than their first away game. At the second away game, they scored eighteen points more than the previous away game. At the third away game, they scored two more points than at their second. If Lola’s team scored 62 points at their last home game, how many points do they have to score in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"Lola's team scored 62 points at their last home game. Since they scored twice as many points at their last home game compared to their first away game, their first away game had 62 / 2 = 31 points. At the second away game, they scored 18 points more than the previous away game, which means they scored 31 + 18 = 49 points. At the third away game, they scored two more points than their second away game, which means they scored 49 + 2 = 51 points. To bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game (62 points * 4 = 248 points), we need to calculate how many points they need to score in their next game: Cumulative points to reach = 248 points. Current cumulative points = home game (62) + first away game (31) + second away game (49) + third away game (51) = 193 points. Thus, Lola's team needs to score 248 - 193 = 55 points in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game."},{"question":"Review: This movie surprised me.

How has the possible shutdown situation affected you? What are you doing to cope? ||||| My colleague Suzanne Kubota at Federal News Radio has put together this Top 10 list of things you should do before c.o.b. Friday in case of a government shutdown: 10) Water the plants. You may be gone for a while. 9) Update your pay information. 8) Make sure your phone number is current in the system. 7) Subscribe to FederalNewsRadio alerts and emails at your HOME address 6) From Dixie @ DoD: \\"Have a go at writing (your) respective Congressional member and letting them know what we do and how we feel.\\" 5) Learn from Senior Corresondent Mike Causey's experience: Write down those passwords you carry in your head and save them someplace safe. It's easy to forget them without frequent use. 4) Update email and phone out of office message. 3) Throw out what you have in the office fridge. Replace it when you come back. 2) And no matter what happens, plan on showing up for work Monday, at least to turn in your BlackBerry. 1) Turn in your time card. And the final tip comes from CNN's Bob Constantini. He said federal employees who ride the morning MARC train with him said they \\"haven't heard that much from their bosses about what to do. They were told to turn in their timecards today to make it faster, perhaps, that they might get paid.\\" What's on your Pre-Shutdown To-Do List? ||||| Social Web At Web's Social Hive For Government Workers, A Mix Of Disillusion, Hope Enlarge image i Alex Wong / Getty Images Alex Wong / Getty Images As the government shutdown started to seem inevitable, the talk on the public employee social networking site govloop.com quickened. It started with the practical, like a top ten list of what government workers should do in case of a shutdown: Things like water your plants, fill out your timecard and make plans to show up at the office on Monday to, in the least, turn in your Blackberry. Then as the sun set on Friday, it turned to the comical: Like Conan O'Brien, one member suggested, govies should stop shaving and grow a beard as long as the furlough lasts. But with the threat looming large, some members of the site, turned serious. A good deal of the sentiments expressed dealt with the fact that these people were worker bees who felt stuck and powerless facing a Congress playing politics and an American public who thinks government workers are fat and lazy. Danielle Blumenthal asked how the threat of shutdown affected other members' commitment to public service. Henry Brown responded by saying it was the \\"FINAL straw in forcing me into scheduling my retirement.\\" Karen, on the site's Facebook page, said she'd rather the government shutdown than keep riding a wave of uncertainty \\"every two weeks.\\" Peter Sperry? He took the philosophical view: It is an unfortunate part of the politcal process but a small price to pay for living in a democracy. I am sure the Chinese government will never shut down and the Libyan government seems able to remain open but I would not trade their system for ours. Govloop, known by some as the Facebook for government workers, was founded by Steve Ressler, who spent more than five years as a government worker himself. He left the public sector after govloop became successful enough that he had to dedicate himself full-time to the site. He started the site in June of 2008 and now has some 42,000 members. He said the threat of a government shutdown has energized the community. \\"Most public servants want to do good,\\" said Ressler. \\"They're passionate about what they do and they want to give back.\\" He said as members mulled a shutdown, the site created mentoring relationships where workers who had been through the '95 shutdown or the state government workers who had been laid off by the hundreds shared tips and experiences with the government newbies. In some ways, said Ressler, the site has also humanized the public worker. To that end, Kerry Ann O'Connor proposed that if the furlough did come, the feds should take the opportunity to reconnect with the American public. Tell your stories, O'Connor extolled. \\"What people don't understand is that federal workers are people, too,\\" said Ressler. As Friday came to an end and a deal seemed impossible, news that Z-Burger in Washington, D.C. was giving away free burgers to federal employees worked its way through the network. \\"If you went out there, there's probably a line full of people you went to high school with, a neighbor, someone on the same kickball team as you,\\" said Ressler. At the eleventh hour, Democrats and Republicans came to an agreement and averted the first government shutdown in more than 15 years. A hopeful piece from Blumenthal remained one of the most popular on govloop. It was about her \\"Karate Kid moment,\\" she wrote. You know, that scene when Daniel \\"faced his fear and found his inner strength:\\" |||||","response":"This article talks about government workers who might not be able to work if the government shuts down.

Hamill shares a memory of trying on Fisher's Leia jumpsuit, which was so tight that he looked like a \\"Vegas lounge singer.\\" He also expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to maintain their friendship and work together in the recent Star Wars movies. Carrie Fisher passed away at the age of 60 on December 27, 2016, after suffering a cardiac arrest. Hamill highlights the fact that they met when Fisher was just 19 years old, and he was 24, and he fondly remembers her as \\"brutally candid,\\" with a strong sense of humor. Hamill also notes that, while their friendship had its ups and downs, his life would have been \\"so much drabber and less interesting\\" without her presence.

The Bazga River is a tributary of the Bohotin River in Romania . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other? pick from the following. 1). no 2). yes","response":"2). Yes The sentences \\"The Bazga River is a tributary of the River Bohotin in Romania\\" and \\"The Bazga River is a tributary of the Bohotin River in Romania\\" are indeed paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The aim is to reword the text while retaining the original meaning and to present it in such a way that it provides the same information in a different format or style, without changing the context or altering the core message. The two sentences given here are talking about the same subject: The Bazga River and its relationship to the Bohotin River. Both say that the Bazga River is a tributary of the Bohotin River in Romania. The difference between them is in word order. In the first sentence, it is mentioned as \\"the River Bohotin,\\" whereas in the second sentence, the wording is \\"the Bohotin River.\\" Despite this syntactical variation, the meaning of the two sentences remains identical. In English, it is common to see the word order of \\"River + Name\\" or \\"Name + River.\\" For instance, you might see \\"the River Nile\\" in one text and \\"the Nile River\\" in another. Both formats are correct and are widely accepted in usage. This flexibility in language allows for variant forms and stylistic changes, contributing to the richness and diversity of vocabulary and syntax. Thus, while the two sentences have slight differences in order, they communicate the same meaning and are indeed paraphrases of each other. They clearly elucidate that The Bazga River is a tributary of the Bohotin River in Romania, and hence both sentences can be used interchangeably depending on the writer's discretion and stylistic preference without any loss or change in conveyed information. Therefore, those two sentences can be rightly identified as paraphrases."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Teacher: Let's think:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise describes a scene in which \\"a man is riding a wakeboard on a lake.\\" This statement tells us about the activity the man is participating in and the location where it is happening. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"a man is having lots of fun on the wakeboard.\\" This statement makes an assumption about the man's emotional state during the activity. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To establish whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must examine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis. In other words, does the fact that the man is riding a wakeboard on a lake necessarily mean he is having lots of fun? Conclusion: No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Although wakeboarding can be viewed as a fun and exciting activity for many people, the premise does not explicitly state or imply the man's emotional state during the activity. The man could be enjoying the experience, or he could be frustrated, scared, or experiencing any other range of emotions.

The complex, at a site known as Tel Burna, is made up of rooms surrounding a giant courtyard measuring 52 feet by 52 feet. It's not certain who the cult worshiped, but based on the \\"letters of Ugarit\\" (a site located in what is now Syria), experts figure it was probably the Canaanite storm god known as Baal. Canaanites, the International Business Times explains, were people living in the region between approximately the early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Common Era. The complex yielded an array of items including pieces of face masks, person-sized ceramic jars, and animal bones that may indicate animal sacrifices took place there. As for the masks, they \\"may suggest ceremonial processions that arrived or left from the complex,\\" a researcher tells LiveScience. In addition, archaeologists found three connected cups whose use they're unsure of, though they note \\"joint vessels similar in concept ... have been considered as cultic objects.\\" Other items found include figurines that appear to show half-human, half-animal beings, as well as an artifact called a scarab, which bears an Egyptian hieroglyph. The Science Times reports that the discoveries show possible religious links between ancient civilizations; though it describes the site as \\"relatively secluded,\\" both the cups and two large jars, for instance, appear to have originated in Cyprus. (In other archeological news out of Israel, a copper awl has prompted a rethinking of ancient history.) Expand this summary.","response":"Archeologists in Israel have recently uncovered a unique 3,300-year-old complex at the site known as Tel Burna, which is believed to be a gathering place for an ancient cult. The remarkable complex consists of several rooms surrounding an extensive courtyard that measures 52 feet by 52 feet. Although the specific deity worshiped by the cult remains uncertain, experts have conjectured that it might be the Canaanite storm god, Baal, based on the \\"letters of Ugarit,\\" which is a site located in present-day Syria. The Canaanites were a group of people who inhabited the region, roughly covering modern-day Israel, Lebanon, and parts of Jordan and Syria, during the period between the early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Common Era. The archeological findings at this complex have shed light on various religious practices, rituals, and connections among ancient civilizations. Numerous fascinating artifacts were discovered at the site, including pieces of face masks, person-sized ceramic jars, and animal bones. The presence of animal bones hints at the possibility of animal sacrifices being conducted at the site. The masks found at the site are thought to be related to ceremonial processions that either commenced or concluded at the complex, as suggested by a researcher to LiveScience. In addition to these artifacts, archaeologists also uncovered a set of three interconnected cups, the function of which remains unknown. However, similar joint vessels have been identified as cultic objects in the past. Other intriguing items found at the Tel Burna site include figurines displaying half-human, half-animal beings and a unique artifact known as a scarab, which features an Egyptian hieroglyph. The various discoveries at Tel Burna indicate possible religious links between ancient civilizations that were geographically separated. For instance, despite the site being relatively secluded, both the interconnected cups and two large jars discovered appear to have originated in Cyprus. This suggests a level of interaction and influence among different civilizations and cultures of the time. The Tel Burna excavation continues to unravel the mysteries of the ancient world and provide valuable insights into the religious practices and connections between diverse groups of people living thousands of years ago. This discovery in Israel, along with other archaeological findings, such as the copper awl that prompted a rethinking of ancient history, demonstrates the immense potential for understanding the complexities and richness of past civilizations through diligent archaeological research and exploration."},{"question":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

See options at the end James put the egg in the refrigerator and the meat in the sun. Now the Available choices: a). egg is hot.; b). meat is hot.;","response":"b). meat is hot. James, after putting the egg in the refrigerator and the meat in the sun, noticed that the meat is hot. This outcome can be expected because of several factors. 1. Sun Exposure: The primary reason for the meat becoming hot is its exposure to sunlight. Sunlight contains energy in the form of solar radiation, which is composed of various wavelengths such as ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. When an object, in this case, the meat, is exposed to sunlight, it absorbs the energy from these wavelengths, causing its temperature to rise. The longer the meat is exposed to direct sunlight, the hotter it will become. 2. Ambient Temperature: The ambient temperature of the surrounding environment also plays a role in the meat's temperature increment. If the day is hot, the air around the meat is already warm, and its effect on the meat's temperature will be more significant. Conversely, if the day is cold, the meat may not get as hot, even with direct sun exposure. 3. Heat Conduction: The meat's internal temperature will also rise because of heat conduction. As the surface area exposed to sunlight heats up, heat energy travels from the outer layer to the inner layer of the meat. This transfer of heat energy causes the entire piece of meat to become hot. 4. Type of Meat and Surface Color: Different types of meat may absorb sunlight differently, with darker-colored meats generally absorbing more sunlight than lighter-colored ones. Therefore, the type and color of the meat placed in the sun can also influence how hot it gets. While the egg's location in the refrigerator keeps it cool by lowering its temperature to match the refrigerator's set temperature, the opposite happens to the meat. As the meat is exposed to sun and the factors mentioned above, its temperature increases. Therefore, the correct choice is \\"b). meat is hot.\\" because the environmental conditions and the meat's properties lead to this outcome."},{"question":"The National Examinations Council (also known as NECO) is an examination body in Nigeria that conducts the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination and the General Certificate in Education in June / July and December / January respectively.

(CNN) -- Every year the brains behind your favorite reality TV shows flock to Santa Monica, California, to talk shop and honor the best in nonfiction TV. This year's Realscreen West: The Factual Entertainment Forum took place recently over two days; reality TV darling Kim Kardashian was awarded the Hall of Fame Personality of the Year award, while producer Thom Beers, producer of the über hit \\"Deadliest Catch,\\" was inducted into the Hall of Fame and took home three trophies -- most original concept, best docu-reality programming and the 2012 Award of Excellence. At the forum, CNN's KJ Matthews chatted up two of the most successful reality TV producers: SallyAnn Salsano, owner of 495 Productions, better known as the creator of the MTV super-hit \\"Jersey Shore,\\" and Brent Montgomery, owner of Leftfield Pictures, also known as the entity behind the successful History Channel show \\"Pawn Stars.\\" The two talked about everything reality TV-related -- from the shows they wish they had produced to the ongoing struggle to find people for their shows to why they get annoyed at all the people who think creating a reality show is easy. They also touched on how long \\"Jersey Shore\\" might continue, and their thoughts on CNN's decision to partner with celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. CNN: Recently I've noticed that networks which had no reality TV shows are now getting into the reality game. What do you think about that? Brent Montgomery: I love it because that means there are more people for us to sell to. CNN: Is it becoming more difficult to cast or find people in reality TV shows. Some failed actors are using the route of reality TV to get their name out. Montgomery: That's why you don't cast in L.A. I did \\"Blind Date\\" in New York and L.A., and every \\"Blind Date\\" contestant in L.A. was like, \\"Here's my head shots and um, when do I get my 100 and what are the chances of me, you know, when do film directors get to see this and do you guys get a lot of calls?\\" I said never. ... SallyAnn Salsano: (Steven) Spielberg is not watching \\"Blind Date.\\" I mean maybe but not to find talent. I mean he may be watching it. I don't know. But certainly not to cast his next film. CNN: Have you both gotten better at pitching reality shows to networks since you've had a successful track record with some of your shows? Montgomery: I think so. Because I think you get better at anything you do over the course of time. I think I'm better at knowing the steps that it's gonna take to (make a show with) subsequent seasons and how you'll have to have a show that will have room to grow. Salsano: No one wants a \\"one and done.\\" Not a producer and not a network, because in the end of season one, everyone spends so much time behind the scenes in our offices and at the network level trying to crack it. ... But in the end, you put so much into it that if you can get to season two, then you are off to the races. You know what works and you know what didn't work and then you can move forward. CNN: People watch reality TV, and some people think that some of it is crap, and (it) has led many to believe that anybody can create a reality show. Montgomery: This p*sses me off more than anything because people think because they watch TV they can make TV, and that may sound kind of simplistic, but people may actually think that these shows are very simple. I watch \\"Jersey Shore,\\" and I know that for every minute of on-camera drama there is probably an hour or two or more of off-camera drama. My show people say all the time, \\"Wow, it's just such a simple show.\\" We work hard to make them look simple! Salsano: Here is my least favorite (expletive) thing. ... You are in the process of deciding if you want to work with someone, and you show up with your camera, and they say you should have been here yesterday it was so funny. OK, well I'm here today, and if I'm shooting a show; I'm not going to schedule good TV. You're telling me you're so great that you should have your own TV show, then go (show me what you've got)! CNN: Sally, can you ever envision the \\"Jersey Shore\\" (still shooting even in a nursing home)? Salsano: The thing about \\"Jersey Shore\\" is that there is a guido born every day. ... So for me it's an endless supply. CNN: Which show do both of you wish you had created? Montgomery: I like \\"1000 Ways to Die\\"! Salsano: I'm so crazy because I love, like \\"Storage Wars,\\" but I (expletive) love \\"Toddlers & Tiaras\\" so much it hurts. I literally like, (expletive) love it. It's just like crack. I literally can't get enough of that show. Montgomery: Can I change mine? It's \\"An Idiot Abroad.\\" I love that show! CNN: As you both know, CNN recently hired Anthony Bourdain. What do you guys think about that? Salsano: I think it's a great fit. Montgomery: I think it's a great fit, too. I think when you are a network doing something new, why not go after a big name? I'm sure the cross over between your viewers and his show is a high-income viewer. Salsano: I think it's going to be fine. And I actually would like to see the new twist on it. Like I do watch \\"No Reservations\\" like crazy and I (DVR) it, and I'm into it, but now I'm excited to see what happens on another network.

One day I gave her a Ziploc bag with a handful of pennies and told her over the course of a week I wanted her to give me a penny a day. I would deposit the penny in \\" The Bank of Dad\\" and compound interest would begin to accumulate the day she deposited the penny. At the end of the week we would check her bank balance. Each day my daughter handed over one penny at the breakfast table and I deposited it in her bank. I gave her a \\"receipt\\" for her deposit and explained that she needed to keep up with the receipts to see how much money she had added to her account. In an effort to make this a little more realistic, I deposited a penny from my own piggy bank every other day to give her an additional four pennies at the end of the week.

It is usually, but not always, used as a general term in describing the structure of protein fiber, e.g. hair and sperm tail. Its most frequently observed structural pattern is the 9+2 pattern in which two central protofibrils are surrounded by nine other pairs. Cellulose inside plants is one of the examples of non-protein compounds that are using this term with the same purpose. Cellulose microfibrils are laid down in the inner surface of the primary cell wall. As the cell absorbs water, its volume increases and the existing microfibrils separate and new ones are formed to help increase cell strength. As the cell absorbs water, microfibrils separate and new ones are forming. - A hemicellulose (also known as polyose) is any of several heteropolymers (matrix polysaccharides), such as arabinoxylans, present along with cellulose in almost all plant cell walls. While cellulose is crystalline, strong, and resistant to hydrolysis, hemicellulose has a random, amorphous structure with little strength. It is easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base as well as myriad hemicellulase enzymes. - Xyloglucan is a hemicellulose that occurs in the primary cell wall of all vascular plants; however, essential enzymes for xyloglucan metabolism, like XTH and 14-Glucan Synthase are found in Charophyceae algae. In many dicotyledonous plants, it is the most abundant hemicellulose in the primary cell wall. Xyloglucan binds to the surface of cellulose microfibrils and may link them together. It is the substrate of , which cuts and ligates xyloglucans, as a means of integrating new xyloglucans into the cell wall. It is also thought to be the substrate of alpha-expansin, which promotes cell wall enlargement. - Charophyceae is a class (biology) of charophyte green algae. Some botanists include Charophyceae and chlorophyte green algae in the plant kingdom. Charophyceae are a class within the Streptophyta. Current consensus treats Charophyceae as a class under division Charophyta, with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division. - A eukaryote (or or ) is any organism whose cells contain a nucleus and other organelles enclosed within membranes. Eukaryotes belong to the taxon Eukarya or Eukaryota. The defining feature that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea) is that they have membrane-bound organelles, especially the nucleus, which contains the genetic material and is enclosed by the nuclear envelope. The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek (\\"eu\\", \\"well\\" or \\"true\\") and (\\"karyon\\", \\"nut\\" or \\"kernel\\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. In addition, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular or multicellular. Only eukaryotes form multicellular organisms consisting of many kinds of tissue made up of different cell types. - Cellulose is an organic compound with the formula , a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of (14) linked -glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The cellulose content of cotton fiber is 90%, that of wood is 4050% and that of dried hemp is approximately 57%. - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. - In biochemistry, a metabolic pathway is a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell. The reactants, products, and intermediates of an enzymatic reaction are known as metabolites, which are modified by a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. In a metabolic pathway, the product of one enzyme acts as the substrate for the next. These enzymes often require dietary minerals, vitamins, and other cofactors to function. - The dicotyledons, also known as dicots (or more rarely dicotyls), were one of the two groups into which all the flowering plants or angiosperms were formerly divided. The name refers to one of the typical characteristics of the group, namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons. There are around 200,000 species within this group. The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons or monocots, typically having one cotyledon. Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants. - Polysaccharides are polymeric carbohydrate molecules composed of long chains of monosaccharide units bound together by glycosidic linkages and on hydrolysis give the constituent monosaccharides or oligosaccharides. They range in structure from linear to highly branched. Examples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen, and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin. - Expansin refers to a family of closely related nonenzymatic proteins found in the plant cell wall, with important roles in plant cell growth, fruit softening, abscission, emergence of root hairs, pollen tube invasion of the stigma and style, meristem function, and other developmental processes where cell wall loosening occurs. Expansins were originally discovered as mediators of acid growth, which refers to the widespread characteristic of growing plant cell walls to expand faster at low (acidic) pH than at neutral pH. Expansins are thus linked to auxin action. They are also linked to cell enlargement and cell wall changes induced by other plant hormones such as gibberellin, cytokinin, ethylene and brassinosteroids. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - Monosaccharides (from Greek \\"monos\\": single, \\"sacchar\\": sugar), also called simple sugars, are the most basic units of carbohydrates. They are fundamental units of carbohydrates and cannot be further hydrolyzed to simpler compounds. The general formula is . They are the simplest form of sugar and are usually colorless, water-soluble, and crystalline solids. Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. Examples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose) and galactose. Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose) and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). Further, each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group (so, all of the carbons except for the primary and terminal carbon) is chiral, giving rise to a number of isomeric forms, all with the same chemical formula. For instance, galactose and glucose are both aldohexoses, but have different physical structures and chemical properties. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\". - Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase ( XET ) is an apoplastic enzyme found across the plant kingdom . The enzyme catalyzes the endotransglucosylation of two xyloglucan polysaccharides , effectively ' stitching ' them together . - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Neurons are classified based on the direction in which they carry nerve impulses. Choices: - metabolism impulses - energy - neurotransmitters - nerve impulses A:","response":"Neurons are classified based on the direction in which they carry nerve impulses. These cells play a crucial role in the functioning of the nervous system, as they transmit information between different parts of the body and the brain. Understanding the directionality of nerve impulses is key to understanding how neurons function and communicate with one another. The correct answer from the provided choices is: nerve impulses. To elaborate further, neurons are specialized cells that transmit electrical and chemical signals, allowing important information to travel throughout the body. They receive input from other neurons, process it, and generate an output in the form of nerve impulses, also known as action potentials. These impulses travel along the neuron's axon and reach other neurons or target cells via connections called synapses. Neurons can be classified into three main types based on the direction in which they carry nerve impulses: 1. Sensory neurons (afferent neurons): Sensory neurons are responsible for transmitting information from sensory receptors (such as those in the skin, muscles, and organs) to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). These neurons carry nerve impulses in an inward direction, towards the central nervous system for processing and interpretation. 2. Motor neurons (efferent neurons): Motor neurons transmit information from the central nervous system to the peripheral nervous system (the muscles and glands). These neurons play a key role in initiating movements and carrying out other actions in response to stimuli. Motor neurons carry nerve impulses in an outward direction, away from the central nervous system. 3. Interneurons: Interneurons, also known as association neurons or relay neurons, are found within the central nervous system. They play a crucial role in connecting sensory and motor neurons, as well as other interneurons. They help process and coordinate information from various sources, allowing the nervous system to create appropriate responses. Interneurons can carry nerve impulses in multiple directions as they facilitate communication between other neurons. In summary, neurons are classified based on the direction in which they carry nerve impulses, as this greatly impacts their role within the nervous system. Each type of neuron – sensory, motor, and interneuron – carries out a specific function, enabling the body to interpret sensory information, respond to stimuli, and perform various actions."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? See options at the end Rachel was a very good assassin unlike Amy because Choose your answer from: -- Rachel had a very clumsy body. -- Amy had a very clumsy body.","response":"Rachel was a very good assassin unlike Amy because Amy had a very clumsy body. This difference in physical ability greatly affected their respective success and efficiency in the field of assassination. As an assassin, Rachel was known for her remarkable agility, strength, and precision. She had honed her skills over the years, training in various forms of martial arts, weaponry, and stealth tactics. Rachel understood that being an effective assassin required a combination of physical prowess and mental acuity, which she constantly worked on developing. On the other hand, Amy struggled with her physical abilities due to her very clumsy body. She frequently stumbled or dropped objects, which proved to be a considerable liability in her profession. Assassins need to execute their missions flawlessly, and Amy's clumsiness often led to mistakes that could jeopardize an entire operation. Amy's clumsiness also made her a less effective fighter. Assassins must be able to defend themselves in close quarters combat or disarm their opponents skillfully. Amy's lack of coordination left her vulnerable in such situations. In contrast, Rachel's quick reflexes and agility allowed her to remain one step ahead of her adversaries. Moreover, an assassin's success often relies on their ability to move stealthily and unnoticed. Here too, Amy's clumsy nature hindered her effectiveness. No matter how hard she tried, her lack of grace and control over her movements made it difficult for her to blend into her surroundings or move silently. Rachel, on the other hand, had mastered the art of stealth after years of diligent practice. She could easily infiltrate any location without drawing attention to herself. While both Rachel and Amy shared many common traits, such as intelligence, determination, and resourcefulness, Amy's clumsy body significantly affected her abilities as an assassin. It is for this reason that Rachel was a far more skilled and proficient killer, whereas Amy faced countless challenges that stemmed from her lack of physical dexterity. In conclusion, Amy had a very clumsy body, which served as a constant disadvantage in her profession as an assassin. Her inadequacies in movement, stealth, and fighting made it difficult for her to compete with her more competent counterpart, Rachel. This striking disparity between the two assassins highlights the importance of physical prowess and coordination in a field that demands perfection and efficiency."},{"question":"If \\"A young man in goggles observes several test tubes placed in a beaker.\\" does that mean that \\"A young man stirs a mixture within a beaker.\\"?

In response to the question posed by SETimes, it is essential to understand the perspectives of various European colleagues about the ambitions of both Turkish and Bulgarian nations concerning the European Union (EU) labor market. The EU labor market is a strategic economic area that offers numerous opportunities, such as job growth, economic development, and collaboration. As such, countries like Turkey and Bulgaria aim to take advantage of these prospects to foster their overall growth and development. The thoughts of European colleagues about the ambitions of Turkey and Bulgaria differ based on individual perspectives and regional stances. Some European colleagues may view the aspirations of these nations positively, acknowledging their efforts toward economic growth and collaboration. These colleagues recognize that the inclusion of both countries in the EU labor market adds to the diversity and competitiveness of the European economy, making it more resilient. They may also notice the potential benefits in terms of skills, talent, and resources that both countries can bring to the table, contributing to the growth of the EU labor market. Moreover, these positive attitudes might be accompanied by the idea that by including countries like Turkey and Bulgaria in the labor market, the EU can strengthen international ties and foster peace and cooperation in a region. As a result, it is in the best interest of the EU to support the ambitions of such countries in their quest for greater integration with the labor market. On the other hand, some European colleagues might have concerns or reservations about the ambitions of Turkey and Bulgaria in the EU labor market. These concerns may focus on cultural, political, and economic differences among these countries and EU member states, as well as worries about how increased competition might affect European workers, wages, and standards of living. Additionally, potential issues related to immigration and asylum, such as social integration or pressure on local and national resources, could also be among these concerns. Furthermore, those who have reservations might argue that the EU should prioritize the needs of existing member states over the ambitions of aspiring countries. This viewpoint could stem from concerns over political stability, prospects for long-term economic sustainability, and European solidarity. Consequently, it is essential to ensure that fair agreements and regulations are made while considering the interests of all parties involved. In conclusion, the opinions of European colleagues regarding the ambitions of both Turkish and Bulgarian nations about the EU labor market vary depending on personal perspectives, regional stances, and political convictions. Some view these ambitions positively, recognizing the benefits that they can bring to the EU economy and fostering peace and cooperation in the region. Meanwhile, others might have concerns or reservations due to cultural, political, or economic differences and potential consequences for EU workers and member states.

Lita Morgan, who was adopted when she was two-years-old, has now spoken out after her mother was convicted of cruelty against her. A woman subjected to a decade of abuse at the hands of her cruel adoptive mother has spoken of her ordeal for the first time. Christine Morgan forced her adoptive daughter to drink bleach from a cloth used to clean toilets during her ten-year reign of terror. The violence also included holding the child’s head under the bath water until she couldn’t breathe and threatening to kill her. Lita Morgan, who was adopted when she was two-years-old, has now spoken out after her mother was convicted of cruelty against her. Miss Morgan, 27, reported the crimes to police after suffering post-traumatic stress, caused by the abuse, as an adult. She said: 'I never want a child to suffer in the way I did. Nobody capable of such violence should be able to adopt a defenceless child. 'I feel let down and angry that I was left to suffer at her hands for so long. Social services could have saved me but they missed the signs and believed every word she said. 'I doubt I will ever get over what happened to me but I hope speaking out might save another child from the same hell I went through.' Miss Morgan was adopted at the age of two, but the abuse started when she was four-years-old. She said: 'For as long as I could remember mum had treated me differently to my brother who was also adopted. 'I was kept locked in my room and dressed in dirty clothes. If I asked for something to eat she would slap me in the face. 'I was bullied and teased at school for being smelly but she didn’t care.' Miss Morgan, 27, reported the crimes to police after suffering post-traumatic stress, caused by the abuse, as an adult. She is pictured here as a baby with her adoptive mother Christine Morgan. Miss Morgan once asked her mother why she treated her so badly. 'She told me she had wanted to adopt twin baby boys but they had gone to another mother and she got left with me instead. 'I wondered why she had gone ahead with the adoption if she didn’t want me. I dreamed of her taking me back to a children's home so another family could have me. 'I didn’t understand what I had done so wrong for her to despise me as she did.' As she grew older Miss Morgan said the beatings got worse and her adoptive mother often left her covered in bruises. 'She would grab me around the throat and tell me to die. Miss Morgan was adopted at the age of two, but the abuse started when she was four-years-old. 'It wasn’t unusual for her to smack me until my skin was bright red and pull my hair out in clumps.' One day Morgan held her adopted daughter's head under the bath water, leaving the young girl fearing she would die. 'I really thought that was it. I came up gasping for air lucky to alive.' Another time her mother forced a bleach soaked rag used to clean toilets into her mouth. 'I. had been playing on the stairs and she just got angry and grabbed me. and dragged me into the bathroom where she had been cleaning. 'I never want a child to suffer in the way I did. Nobody capable of such violence should be able to adopt a defenceless child' - Lita Morgan. 'She had the dirty rag in her hand, got me in a hold and rammed it into my mouth. 'It was burning like acid and I was gagging. Eventually I managed to escape from her grip to run to my room and throw up.' Miss Morgan claims there were several missed opportunities to rescue her from the abuse. She said: 'One day two women turned up from social services. The school must have told them about my bruising. But mum was a good actress and told them I was just clumsy so they went away again. 'I remember breaking down because I knew then I was never going to be saved.' She said Morgan’s husband also colluded with her to keep the abuse hidden by backing up her lies. Miss Morgan said: 'I was upset but I never blamed him. I could see he was afraid of her too and I honestly think he didn’t know how bad it was because most of it happened when he was at work. Christine Morgan (pictured) was convicted on two cruelty charges at Southampton Crown Court last year. 'He was also scared of losing me because he knew social services would take me away if they knew about the abuse.' It was only after he passed away when she was 17 that Miss Morgan found the strength to leave. 'Without dad the abuse got even worse. I couldn’t take anymore. I confided in a friend who let me stay with her.' Eventually she found a job and a flat and worked all hours to block out the memories of her childhood. But, she said, no matter how hard she tried, she could not forget. She said: 'I suffered flashbacks and nightmares. I would dream I was six years old again with my head under the water gasping for breath.' Her GP referred her for counselling, but Miss Morgan says talking about the abuse made the flashbacks even worse. One day she suffered a breakdown and found herself at her local police station asking for help. She said: 'For the first time someone listened. I made a statement and mum was arrested.' Christine Morgan, 61, appeared at Southampton Crown Court last year. She denied the charges and Miss Morgan gave evidence from behind a screen. During the hearing Elizabeth Bussey-Jones, prosecuting, said: 'She describes from a very early age being subjected to various forms of verbal abuse, being told by Christine Morgan that she hated her, that she was a waste of space and that she wanted to kill her. 'She recalls various acts of violence towards her which vary from being pinned up by the throat against a wall, being smacked and having her hair pulled.' The jury found her mother guilty and she was convicted on two cruelty charges. Morgan was warned to expect jail but because of her failing health Judge Gary Burrell handed her a 12 month suspended prison sentence and ordered her to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. She was also told to pay £1,500 in costs. Miss Morgan has now said: 'I was devastated by the sentence. It didn’t seem fair for what she put me through. But it helped me accept that there was nothing wrong with me and I did not deserve the abuse. 'I was a child who needed a loving home and instead I got placed with that lunatic.

The Arborio rice was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of al dente, while the wild mushrooms added a depth of flavor that was both rich and complex. The chef's choice to top the dish with a sprinkle of truffle oil only served to elevate the dish to another level. Let's not forget about the drinks! Their extensive wine list boasted an impressive selection of international and regional options, with the knowledgeable sommelier gladly offering pairing suggestions. Following her advice, I opted for a glass of full-bodied red wine that exquisitely complemented the flavors of my meal.

Now, let's gather additional information to conclude whether mangoes and peaches are in the same family or not: - Mangoes belong to the genus Mangifera and the family Anacardiaceae. - Peaches belong to the genus Prunus and the family Rosaceae. Based on this information, we can conclude that mangoes (family Anacardiaceae) and peaches (family Rosaceae) are not in the same family, even though they both produce drupes.

Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don’t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary. If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric – ultimately making it harder to clean. For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible. Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process. If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours. If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture. Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine. Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method. Don’t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed. Otherwise, this could permanently set the stain in the fabric.

The doves flew away from the tree and into the bush, since the Select from: - tree was dangerous at that time.. - bush was dangerous at that time..","response":"The doves flew away from the tree and into the bush, since the tree was dangerous at that time. Step 1: Setting the context and understanding the situation The story tells us that doves are taking a precautionary measure by flying away from the tree and into the bush. It indicates that there must be a potential threat near the tree which is causing the birds to change their location. Step 2: Expanding the storyline by focusing on the potential threat The tree had become dangerous due to the presence of a large, menacing snake that had been spotted slithering on its branches earlier that day. The snake was well-known among the forest creatures as a fierce predator and a danger to the birds. Step 3: Describing the birds' actions in response to the threat As the doves sought refuge in the nearby bush, they tried to blend in with the leaves, hoping to remain undetected by the snake. The bush was dense and provided good cover for the doves, making it an ideal spot for them to gather and protect themselves. Step 4: Introducing other characters in the story In the meantime, a crafty fox was lurking nearby, carefully observing the commotion caused by the doves' sudden flight. The fox had a sly plan in mind. He decided to use the snake's presence to his advantage and catch a dove for his dinner. Step 5: Building a twist in the story The fox approached the bush and called out to the doves, pretending to be a concerned friend. \\"Dear doves, I have come to warn you about a venomous snake in the area. It is extremely dangerous and poses a threat to all the birds. I have a hiding place far from here where you will be safe.\\" Step 6: Leading the story towards a climax The doves, panicked and frightened, contemplated the fox's offer. Little did they know that the fox had sinister intentions. Right before they could make a decision, a wise old owl who had been residing in the tree above the bush since the beginning heard everything and decided to intervene. Step 7: Wrapping up the story The wise old owl swooped down and exposed the fox's cunning plan to the doves. \\"The snake poses a threat indeed, but don't trust this fox! He is trying to take advantage of your fear.\\" With the owl's guidance, the doves managed to find a safer place to nest, far away from both the snake and the deceptive fox, and life in the forest resumed its natural course.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

The only way he could account for his presence there in a ranger's camp was that MacNelly hoped to get useful information out of him. Still that would hardly have made this captain so eager. There was a mystery here, and Duane could scarcely wait for it to be solved. While eating he had bent keen eyes around him. After a first quiet scrutiny the rangers apparently paid no more attention to him. They were all veterans in service--Duane saw that--and rugged, powerful men of iron constitution. Despite the occasional joke and sally of the more youthful members, and a general conversation of camp-fire nature, Duane was not deceived about the fact that his advent had been an unusual and striking one, which had caused an undercurrent of conjecture and even consternation among them. These rangers were too well trained to appear openly curious about their captain's guest. If they had not deliberately attempted to be oblivious of his presence Duane would have concluded they thought him an ordinary visitor, somehow of use to MacNelly. As it was, Duane felt a suspense that must have been due to a hint of his identity.

Physical reasoning tasks usually require an understanding of fundamental concepts in physics, such as mechanics, kinematics, dynamics, and energy, as well as the ability to use mathematical skills to model and solve problems in these areas. A suitable task should be designed to evaluate the individual's analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and knowledge of physical concepts. Here's a detailed and long example of a task that can test one's ability to perform physical reasoning: **Task: Ballistics Assessment** Objective: Analyze the trajectory and hitting point of an object thrown under different situations and conditions. Overview: In this task, the individual will be required to determine various aspects of an object's flight or trajectory when it is thrown in different scenarios. The task will test their understanding of kinematics, projectile motion, and the impact of external forces, such as air resistance and gravity, on the object's motion. Procedure: Scenario 1: Horizontal Projectile Motion 1. A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a cliff with an initial speed of 20 meters per second. Calculate the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground, neglecting air resistance. Assume the cliff height is 50 meters. Scenario 2: Inclined Projectile Motion 1. Now, consider the same cliff and ball in Scenario 1, but this time the ball is thrown at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal. Calculate the maximum height, horizontal range, and the time of flight for the projectile, neglecting air resistance. Scenario 3: Forces in Projectile Motion 1. The ball in Scenario 2 is thrown on a windy day, experiencing an air resistance force proportional to the square of its velocity. Provide a qualitative explanation of how the air resistance force will affect the projectile's trajectory and range. Scenario 4: Optimal Launch Angle 1. Determine the optimal launch angle to achieve the maximum horizontal range for a projectile launched from ground level under ideal conditions (no air resistance). Provide an explanation and show your work. Scenario 5: Design an Experiment 1. Design an experiment to validate your calculations from Scenarios 1 and 2. Describe the experimental setup, required equipment, measurement techniques, possible challenges, and steps to minimize errors in your experiment. Assessment: The individual's ability to perform physical reasoning will be assessed based on their: 1. Understanding of the principles of physics involved in the problem, including projectile motion, gravitational force, and air resistance. 2. Ability to apply mathematical concepts and techniques to model and solve the problem. 3. Capacity to critically analyze the impact of external factors on the object's trajectory and to recognize any limitations in their calculation due to simplifications. 4. Understanding of the experimental methods and practical considerations in performing the experiment to test their predictions. 5. Creativity in designing an appropriate and feasible experiment while considering possible challenges in controlling and measuring variables. In summary, this task can serve as a comprehensive test of someone's ability to perform physical reasoning by combining a range of mathematical, physical, and experimental concepts in a real-world scenario."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: A group of scientists is conducting a study on the effects of electro-magnetic fields (EMFs) emitted by cell phones on human cognitive functions.

The rockets are used to carry instruments from above the surface of the Earth; the altitude generally between weather balloons and satellites (the maximum altitude for balloons is about and the minimum for satellites is approximately ). Certain sounding rockets, such as the Black Brant X and XII, have an apogee between ; the maximum apogee of their class. Sounding rockets often use military surplus rocket motors. NASA routinely flies the Terrier Mk 70 boosted Improved Orion lifting payloads into the exoatmospheric region between . - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space. - In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - In mathematics, an ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. As such, it is a generalization of a circle, which is a special type of an ellipse having both focal points at the same location. The shape of an ellipse (how \\"elongated\\" it is) is represented by its eccentricity, which for an ellipse can be any number from 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to arbitrarily close to but less than 1. - In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Thor - Delta , also known as Delta DM - 19 or just Delta was an early American expendable launch system used for 12 orbital launches in the early 1960s . A derivative of the Thor - Able , it was a member of the Thor family of rockets , and the first member of the Delta family . The first stage was a Thor missile in the DM - 19 configuration . The second stage was the Delta , which had been derived from the earlier Able stage . An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage . The Thor - Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage . This configuration was reused for a large number of later rockets , and a derivative , the Delta II , remained in service into 2011 . The Thor - Delta launched a number of significant payloads , including the first communications satellite , Echo 1A ; the first British satellite , Ariel 1 ; and the first active direct - relay communications satellite , Telstar 1 . All 12 launches occurred from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17 . The launch of Telstar 1 used pad B , while all other launches were from pad A. All launches were successful except the maiden flight , which failed to place Echo 1 into orbit due a problem with the second stage . - A natural satellite or moon is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another Small Solar System Body). - An expendable launch system is a launch system that uses an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) to carry a payload into space. The vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once (i.e. they are \\"expended\\" during a single flight), and their components are not recovered for re-use after launch. The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed. - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - The Thor-Able was an American expendable launch system and sounding rocket used for a series of re-entry vehicle tests and satellite launches between 1958 and 1960. It was a two stage rocket, consisting of a Thor IRBM as a first stage, and a Vanguard-derived Able second stage. On some flights, an Altair solid rocket motor was added as a third stage. It was a member of the Thor family, and an early predecessor of the Delta. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. What entity does 'thor-delta' has the relation 'subclass of' with? Answer:","response":"The entity 'Thor-Delta' has the relation 'subclass of' with the Thor family of rockets. It is a derivative of the Thor-Able and represents an early member of the Delta family of rockets. The Thor-Delta was developed by combining the first stage from a Thor missile in the DM-19 configuration with a Delta upper stage. The use of the Thor missile and Delta upper stage became a popular combination for many future rockets, even leading to the development of the Delta II, which remained in service into the 2010s."},{"question":"Concepts: bee, collect, flower, nectar Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"Bees collect sweet nectar from flowers to make delicious honey for their bee family."},{"question":"Premise: \\"right i know where his big gun is like his shotgun and stuff but um his pistols and stuff like that and he keeps those hidden and it is just for our protection it's you know if we did have a prowler he he keeps it like um he has the little rotary dial thing and like\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"He keeps his small firearms hidden for our protection.\\" true?

Statement 1 refers to the 2015 elections as \\"regional elections,\\" while Statement 2 refers to them as the \\"federal election.\\" Nevertheless, both seem to be referring to the same event—the 2015 elections concerning the Veneto region. 2. In Statement 1, Tosi is excluded by the \\"Federal Party.\\" In Statement 2, Tosi is sidelined by the \\"regional party.\\" The statements slightly differ here - one refers to a \\"Federal Party\\" and the other a \\"Regional Party,\\" which can have different meanings depending on the contexts. However, they both describe Tosi being removed from consideration during these elections. 3. Both statements include Gidoni's election to the regional council in the province of Belluno. The only difference is how they refer to the council—Statement 1 as the \\"Veneto Regional Council\\" and Statement 2 as the \\"Regional Council of Veneto.\\" However, these can be considered the same as they both represent the same governing body. In conclusion, the statements have a very similar meaning but with slight differences in terms of phrasing and terminology. To best categorize the level of similarity between the two statements, it would be appropriate to select option 2, which acknowledges that there are differences, but the core meaning remains the same. So, the answer is 2. yes"},{"question":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Rose, Helmut and Mary have to clean up the place after the party.

Step 2: Develop a beginning that sets the scene and introduces the problem Rose: (Sighs) Well, that was a great party, but we'd better start cleaning up. Helmut: Yeah, we don't want to lose our deposit. Mary: Absolutely, I'll go grab the cleaning supplies. Step 3: Progress the plot through dialog where they discuss the contract Rose: Why did they have to put that in the contract anyway? It seems like the venue should take care of the cleaning. Helmut: I think it's because they've had problems in the past with people leaving the place trashed. Probably easier to enforce rules in the contract. Mary: (Returning with a mop and bucket) Plus, it helps keep their costs down, I guess. Step 4: Introduce any challenges or highlights faced during the task Rose: Hey, you guys, how are we supposed to get this confetti off the floor? Helmut: Um, maybe try using a vacuum cleaner? I'll go find one. Mary: And there's some food stains on the tablecloth. I think we'll need to use some stain remover before washing it. Step 5: Show the characters working together to complete the task Rose: (Starts vacuuming) Helmut, can you give me a hand with these heavy chairs? Helmut: Sure thing, Rose.

Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President). The state's U.S. Senate seats..., can you guess it ? A:","response":"The current name of the third-party movement that was able to elect Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998 is the Independence Party."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Giza pyramids and Sphinx, landscape."},{"question":"Write the answer: The Scottish port of Stranraer stands on which sea loch, which acts a natural harbour for shipping?","response":"The Scottish port of Stranraer stands on the Sea Loch called Loch Ryan. Loch Ryan is a significant sea loch that is located on the west coast of Scotland, situated in the southern part of the country, more specifically, in the county of Wigtownshire, Dumfries and Galloway. As a sea loch, Loch Ryan is a long, narrow inlet of the sea, providing a unique natural harbour. Its unique shape, with a wider entrance narrowing towards the loch's terminus, acts as a protective barrier against harsh weather conditions coming from the open sea, thereby creating safe anchorage for ships. The depth and sheltered condition of Loch Ryan make it an ideal spot for providing harbor services. Accordingly, the port town of Stranraer has grown around it, capitalizing on the geographical advantage offered by the loch. Stranraer is the second largest town in the area, after Dumfries, with a history that dates back to the 1300s. Historically, Stranraer was a key maritime gateway that connected Scotland with Northern Ireland, primarily due to its location on Loch Ryan. The town served as a busy ferry port for many centuries, with services to and from Belfast and Larne. Although the ferry services have now moved to the nearby port at Cairnryan, Stranraer, with its picturesque setting on the shores of Loch Ryan, continues to be a vital maritime location. Loch Ryan, with its biodiversity, is a valuable ecosystem. It offers a habitat for a wide variety of marine life. Some species of fish found in its waters include cod, herring, and sea trout while the shores and waters host different types of sea birds and migratory species. In summary, the Scottish port of Stranraer stands on Loch Ryan, which serves as a natural harbour for shipping due to its protective and sheltered shape, ample depth, and geographically strategic location. This sea loch has been central to the development and economy of the port town and continues to be of significant ecological and maritime importance."},{"question":"Translate to Turkish: UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz urged Skopje and Athens on Tuesday (March 25th) to consider his new proposal for a compromise in their 17-year-long dispute about Macedonia's name, after a new round of talks failed to produce a deal.","response":"Step 1: Identify the main elements of the sentence to make sure the translation maintains the meaning and context.

Use your fingertips to massage a gentle cleanser, such as Dove or Cetaphil, into your skin using gentle, circular motions for about a minute. Rinse your face thoroughly. Use lukewarm water; hot water can damage sensitive skin. Pat your face dry using a clean towel. Don’t rub or scrub! You can also choose a plant-oil based cleaner. Grapeseed and sunflower oils are common bases for these cleaners, and can help absorb and dissolve the extra oil from your skin. Some people have allergies or sensitivities to essential oils, so before you put any essential oil into your steam cleanse, test it on your skin. Mix together three drops of essential oil with ½ teaspoon of a carrier oil, such as sunflower oil. Apply a few drops to the pad of an adhesive bandage and put the bandage on the inside of your forearm. Leave for 48 hours. If your skin is red, itchy, swollen, or develops a rash, do not use that essential oil for your steam cleanse. Thyme, oregano, clove, and cinnamon oil can cause skin irritation in some people. Many citrus oils can cause burning on your skin if it is exposed to sunlight after application. Bring the water to a boil and let it boil for a minute or two. Several essential herbal oils have antibacterial or antiseptic properties, allowing them to kill the bacteria and other microorganisms on your skin that can promote acne. You should never ingest essential oils, as many are toxic or cause unpleasant side effects when consumed. Here are some good options: Spearmint or peppermint. Add one drop per quart of water; you can increase this if necessary. Both peppermint and spearmint oil contain menthol, which has antiseptic properties. Thyme. Thyme has antibacterial properties and increases blood circulation by opening up blood vessels. Calendula. Calendula has antimicrobial properties and can help accelerate skin healing. Lavender. In addition to being very soothing, lavender oil has antibacterial properties. Rosemary. Rosemary is naturally antibacterial and is especially effective against P. acnes. Oregano. Oregano oil is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. Avoid tea tree oil for steam baths, as it is highly toxic when consumed. You can substitute ½ teaspoon of the dried herb for essential oil if you can’t find the essential oil. After you have added the herbs and boiled for one minute, remove the pot from the heat. Move it to a stable, comfortable area, such as a countertop or table. You may want to place the hot pot on a trivet or cloth. Place your face over the steaming pot. Close your eyes. Keep your face at least 12 inches from the water. The steam will dilate your blood vessels and open up your pores, but getting too close to the hot water could damage or even burn your skin. Try to relax and take even, calming breaths. Keep your face over the steam for 10 minutes. If you begin to feel uncomfortable before the 10 minutes is up, move away from the steam. Use lukewarm water to rinse your face, and then pat it dry with a clean towel. Don’t rub your skin. You can use a brand of moisturizer that will not block pores, such as Olay, Neutrogena, or Clinique. You can also make your own acne-fighting moisturizer using natural oils. Check the labels of store-brand moisturizers. Choose one that states that it will not clog pores (noncomedogenic) and is oil-free.. You can safely use this steam cleanse up to twice a day: once in the morning and once at night. After two weeks, you should see improvement in your acne. Once you see improvement, you can go down to once a day. Summary:","response":"To maintain healthy skin and prevent acne, it's essential to keep hair out of your face and to gently cleanse your skin using a product like Dove or Cetaphil. Use lukewarm water and avoid rubbing or scrubbing when drying your face. Plant-oil based cleaners, such as grapeseed or sunflower oil, can also be effective for cleansing. Before using any essential oils for steam cleansing, test them on your skin for possible allergic reactions. Some essential oils that can be used for steam cleansing include spearmint, peppermint, thyme, calendula, lavender, rosemary, and oregano. Tea tree oil, on the other hand, should be avoided. When performing a steam cleanse, keep your face at least 12 inches away from the hot water for no more than 10 minutes. Rinsing your face with lukewarm water, patting dry, and moisturizing with noncomedogenic products can ensure that your skin remains healthy and acne-free. Steam cleansing can be done up to twice a day for best results, and improvement should be visible within two weeks."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to French: Malaysia, since attaining independence in 1957, upholds the promotion and protection of all human rights as an indispensable aspect in the process of nation-building.","response":"To translate the sentence \\"Malaysia, since attaining independence in 1957, upholds the promotion and protection of all human rights as an indispensable aspect in the process of nation-building.\\" into French, we have to break it down into segments and then put them back together in French.

The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists.

The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),[citation needed]; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).[citation needed] Q: What is included in or accompanies in \\"critical edition\\"?","response":"A \\"critical edition\\" is a scholarly work that aims to establish the most accurate and authoritative version of a given text, as close as possible to the original or author's intended form. It is produced through the careful examination, comparison, and analysis of various manuscripts, early printed editions, and other relevant sources. A critical edition is accompanied by an apparatus criticus or critical apparatus, which serves as the foundation of the editor's work and provides transparency to the editorial process. In a critical edition, the following components are typically included: 1. The main text: This is the editor's reconstructed version of the text, which is believed to be the closest representation of the original or intended form. It has undergone extensive textual criticism and incorporates all the relevant corrections, emendations, and improvements based on the available evidence. 2. The critical apparatus: This is a set of scholarly annotations and notes that accompany the main text. It contains information about the various sources consulted, the editorial decisions made, and the rationale behind those decisions. The critical apparatus is usually divided into three parts: a. List or description of the evidence: The first part provides a comprehensive list or description of the sources used in the edition. These may include manuscripts, early printed editions, and other relevant textual evidence. The sources are usually identified using abbreviations called sigla. b. Editor's analysis of the evidence: The second part details the editor's analysis and evaluation of the evidence. This may include an assessment of the textual history, transmission, and relationships among the sources, as well as a discussion of any questionable passages or discrepancies. In some cases, the editor may also provide a likelihood rating for specific variants or readings. c. Record of rejected variants of the text: The third part presents a record of the alternative readings or textual variants that were considered but ultimately rejected by the editor. These variants are often listed in order of preference, reflecting the editor's judgment on their relative significance and reliability. 3. Introduction and supplementary material: A critical edition may also include an introductory section that provides background information about the work, its author, and the editorial process. This section may cover historical context, details about the manuscript tradition, and any challenges or issues encountered during the editorial work. In addition, supplementary material such as glossaries, indexes, and bibliographies may be provided to aid the reader in understanding and navigating the text. In summary, a \\"critical edition\\" includes the reconstructed main text that approximates the original, along with a critical apparatus containing the list of evidence, editor's analysis, and record of rejected variants.

The premise only provides information about the presence and crafting of items from shark's teeth and occasionally entire jaws, but it does not offer any details about the pricing, cost, or allocation of funds to conservation efforts. In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, we would need more information specifically about the prices of these items and if any percentage of the sales is directed towards conservation efforts. This information could come from various sources such as direct communication with the seller, observing the pricing and funding allocation in the market, or accessing related documents or articles that explain this information. However, we can use the given premise as a starting point to analyze the scenario. Since items are crafted from shark's teeth and even entire jaws, it implies that there is a market demand for such items, and people might be interested in purchasing them. The hypothesis suggests a price of 50 per jaw and a portion of the sales going towards conservation efforts, which could be an attractive proposition for potential buyers who are ecologically conscious or supportive of such efforts. To explore the hypothesis further, we could examine the factors that might affect the price of these crafted items. The cost of materials (shark's teeth or jaws), the skill and time needed to create the items, market competition, and local economic conditions could all contribute to the final pricing. Furthermore, if a portion of the sales is indeed allocated to conservation efforts, we would expect the seller or market organizers to communicate this to potential buyers as a unique selling point, promoting ethical consumption and environment-friendly practices. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The jaws cost 50 each, and a portion goes to local conservation efforts\\" cannot be confirmed or refuted solely based on the given premise. Additional information on pricing and funds allocation is required to determine its validity. However, the context provided allows us to consider the potential interest in these crafted items and the factors that might contribute to their price and appeal in the market."},{"question":"Information: - Kindergarten (from German , which literally means \\"garden for the children\\") is a preschool educational approach traditionally based on playing, singing, practical activities such as drawing, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school.

The battle between Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall over the £10m mansion they once shared has grown increasingly bitter as they fight for the ownership and division of the couple's shared assets. This war over the valuable collection of antiques, paintings, and other art pieces at Downe House has caused tension between the two, with both Jagger and Hall unwilling to back down or compromise. Friends and acquaintances of the former couple say this conflict has caused a significant rift in their relationship, which had once been amicable following their separation. Additionally, sources close to the couple have revealed that Mick Jagger, the legendary front man of the Rolling Stones, has been seeking legal advice on how to best handle the situation and protect his interests. In contrast, Jerry Hall, who has found success in her theatrical career, notably playing Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate, is determined to stand her ground as she believes she should be entitled to a fair share of the assets in question, since they were acquired during their 21-year relationship. As the drama unfolds in this bitter battle between Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall over their £10m London mansion, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the once-loving couple's legacy may be overshadowed by their ongoing feud—leaving their friends and fans with a sense of disappointment and disillusionment. As the legal proceedings continue to play out, it seems that the most logical conclusion to this heated war would be for the two parties to find a way to come to a compromise; however, with their stubborn approach and continuing animosity, there is a likelihood that this conflict would ultimately lead to a long, drawn-out court case that may not only financially drain Jagger and Hall but further tarnish their legacies. In the end, the most logical completion to this news story would be if Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall were able to put their differences aside and negotiate a fair resolution for the division of the assets held in their £10m London mansion, Downe House.

This land eventually became the province of Flevoland, with a population of nearly 400,000 (2011). - The River IJssel, sometimes called Gelderse IJssel (\\"Gueldern IJssel\\") to avoid confusion with the Hollandse IJssel, is the branch of the Rhine in the Dutch provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel. The Romans knew the river as Isala. The IJssel flows from Westervoort, east of the city of Arnhem, until it discharges into the IJsselmeer (\\"Lake IJssel\\", known prior to the 1932 completion of the Afsluitdijk as the Zuiderzee, a North Sea inlet). The River IJssel is one of the three major distributary branches (along with the rivers Nederrijn and Waal) into which the Rhine divides shortly after crossing the German-Dutch border. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Creating a privacy screen in a shared room can be achieved by hanging up a bed sheet in the middle of the room. This is because bed sheets are large enough to cover a significant area, and they are also opaque, making it difficult for people on either side of the sheet to see each other. Option (2) - hanging up tissue paper in the middle of the room - is not an effective solution for creating a privacy screen. Tissue paper is typically thin, and it can be easily torn or damaged.

These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, long range, short range and extremely long range target engagement. - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower. - Fortifications are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin \\"fortis\\" (\\"strong\\") and \\"facere\\" (\\"to make\\"). - A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. This derives from \\"sedere\\", Latin for \\"to sit\\". Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. - A tractor unit (prime mover or traction unit) is a characteristically heavy-duty towing engine that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load. These fall into two categories: very heavy-duty typically off-road capable, often 6×6, military and commercial tractor units, including ballast tractors, and heavy and medium duty military and commercial rear-wheel drive \\"semi tractors\\" used for hauling semi-trailers. - A ballast tractor is a specially weighted tractor unit of a heavy hauler combination. It is designed to utilize a drawbar to pull or push heavy or exceptionally large trailored loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6×4 and 6×6. - In international arms control, small arms include revolvers and pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns. Together with light weapons (heavy machine guns; hand-held grenade launchers; portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns; recoilless rifles; portable launchers of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems; and mortars of calibres of less than 100 mm), they comprise the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) protocol. - A half-track is a civilian or military vehicle with regular wheels at the front for steering and continuous tracks at the back to propel the vehicle and carry most of the load. The purpose of this combination is to produce a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle. - Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large howitzer, field gun, a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield. - A semi-trailer (British English) or semitrailer (American English) is a trailer without a front axle. In the US, the term is also used to refer to the combination of a truck and a semi-trailer, a tractor-trailer. - An artillery tractor , also referred to as a gun tractor , is a specialized heavy - duty form of tractor unit used to tow artillery pieces of varying weights and calibres . It may be wheeled , tracked , or half - tracked . - A siege engine is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city walls and other fortifications in siege warfare. Some have been operated close to the fortifications, while others have been used to attack from a distance. From antiquity, siege engines were constructed largely of wood and tended to use mechanical advantage to fling stones and similar missiles. With the development of gunpowder and improved metallurgical techniques, siege engines became artillery. Collectively, siege engines or artillery together with the necessary troops and transport vehicles to conduct a siege are referred to as a siege-train.

Adults of this family are almost always confined to fresh water. This is the only family in the superfamily Atyoidea. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: - The telson is the posterior-most division of the body of an arthropod. It is not considered a true segment because it does not arise in the embryo from teloblast areas as do real segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked \\"tail\\" called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location.

It contains the following species: - Atyopsis is a genus of freshwater shrimp from Southeast Asia . It was erected in 1983 by Fenner A. Chace , Jr. for two species formerly treated in the genus Atya . It differs from Atya by various characters , including the form of the telson ( which is longest at the corners in Atyopsis , but not in Atya ) and the presence of a \`\` massive spur '' on the male third pereiopod . The genus comprises two species , Atya spinipes and Atyopsis moluccensis . No fossil representatives are known . They are found on high islands from Sri Lanka to the Samoan Islands , and as far north as Okinawa , as well as on the Asian mainland from the Malay Peninsula to India . The two species differ in the number of teeth on the underside of the rostrum , A. spinipes having 2 -- 6 , while A. moluccensis has 7 -- 16 . When kept in the aquarium this species prefers to have a moderate water flow . This shrimp feeds using its feather like claspers to filter particles from the water . If food is scarce you may find them foraging through the substrate . Like any other crustacean the bamboo shrimp will molt in order to grow . During this process the shrimp is very vulnerable to predation so ample hiding spaces should be provided e.g. small cave structures , dense foliage , etc. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'atyopsis'?

This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. Paragraph: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia.

When translated to Turkish, becomes: \\"Buna karşılık, Sırp hükümetine neredeyse hiç taviz verilmedi.\\" Below, you can find a detailed explanation and a breakdown of the Turkish translation alongside the English sentence: 1. \\"By contrast\\" -> \\"Buna karşılık\\": \\"By contrast\\" is an adverbial phrase that is used to show that the following information presents a strong difference with the previously mentioned information. In Turkish, \\"Buna karşılık\\" serves the same purpose. 2. \\"almost\\" -> \\"neredeyse\\": The adverb \\"almost\\" is utilized to denote that something is very close to a particular point or quality without completely reaching it. In Turkish, the equivalent term for \\"almost\\" is \\"neredeyse.\\" 3. \\"no concessions\\" -> \\"hiç taviz\\": In English, \\"no concessions\\" highlights that nothing was given, agreed upon, or compromised. In Turkish, this concept can be translated as \\"hiç taviz,\\" which means no compromise or concession was granted. 4. \\"were made\\" -> \\"verilmedi\\": \\"were made\\" represents an action that happened in the past, which translates to \\"verilmedi\\" in Turkish. \\"Verilmedi\\" is the negative past tense of the Turkish verb \\"vermek\\" (to give), so it means \\"was not given.\\" 5. \\"to the Serbian government\\" -> \\"Sırp hükümetine\\": Finally, \\"to the Serbian government\\" indicates the recipient of the action in the sentence, which can be translated into Turkish as \\"Sırp hükümetine.\\" The Turkish genitive case is used when showing possession or association, which is represented by the suffix \\"e\\" attached to \\"hükümet\\" (government). When combining all these elements, the translation of \\"By contrast, almost no concessions were made to the Serbian government\\" into Turkish is \\"Buna karşılık, Sırp hükümetine neredeyse hiç taviz verilmedi.\\""},{"question":"Process: - A satellite&#x27;s need is determined - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket - The rocket is launched into space. Question: suppose a bigger satellite is designed happens, how will it affect a crew builds a smaller physical satellite. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"When a bigger satellite is designed, it will have more effect on the crew building a smaller physical satellite. This is because the bigger satellite will likely have an increased complexity due to larger size, additional components, and more intricate systems. This may require the crew working on the smaller satellite to adapt their building techniques and allocate additional resources, such as manpower and equipment, for effectively constructing and assembling the bigger satellite. However, the specific impact on the smaller satellite construction process would primarily depend on the shared resources and personnel involved in both projects. If the designs and construction of the two satellites are being carried out by separate teams with separate resources, then the perturbation caused by the new requirements for the bigger satellite might have less or no effect on the construction process of the smaller one. In summary, the influence of a bigger satellite design on the crew building a smaller physical satellite largely depends on the extent to which the projects share resources and workforce. If there is a significant overlap, it could have a more substantial effect, but if the projects are mostly independent, the effect might be less or nonexistent."},{"question":"What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had several siblings? from the following article ? Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England.

Each year, 10.8 out of every 1,000 late-model Escalades get stolen, broken into, or have parts ripped off. That's the highest rate of theft claims of any vehicle in America. The Escalade has topped the list since 2002. You may have heard that a lot of Toyota Camrys get stolen. They do. But it's only 1.6 out of every thousand. The institute looked only at cars from the most recent three model years. These cars all have the latest anti-theft technologies, including engine immobilizers that prevent hot-wiring. \\"That won't stop a determined thief from loading a car on a flat-bed truck,\\" said Russ Rader, the institute's spokesman. Take a look at the most-stolen vehicles. According to the institute, the top-ten car-criminal favorites, along with their \\"theft claim frequency\\" per 1,000 vehicles, are:. 1. Cadillac Escalade 10.8. 2. Chevrolet Silverado 8.0. 3. Dodge Charger 7.4. 4. Chevrolet Avalanche 7.4. 5. Infiniti G47 coupe 7.1. 6. GMC Sierra Crew Cab 6.7. 7. Nissan Maxima 6.5. 8. Hummer H2 6.2. 9. GMC Yukon XL 6.0. 10. Chevrolet Tahoe 5.8. This list excludes medium-duty work trucks, such as the Ford F-250. It also excludes the Dodge Charger Hemi, which the institute counted as a separate model with a theft rate of 7.1. If included, those vehicles would have ranked 2nd and 7th, respectively.","response":"The Cadillac Escalade SUV has once again emerged as the most targeted vehicle by thieves in America, reports the Highway Loss Data Institute. With a theft claim frequency of 10.8 out of every 1,000 late-model Escalades, the luxury SUV has maintained its infamous position since 2002. This finding is particularly intriguing as the institute had only focused on the vehicles of the three most recent model years, which possess state-of-the-art anti-theft technologies like engine immobilizers. However, Russ Rader, the institute's spokesperson, noted that such advancements are powerless against a determined thief who can easily load a car on a flat-bed truck.

Q: San Francisco (CNN) -- The three largest U.S. cellular carriers by subscribers sell the latest iPhone, and next week, eighth-place C Spire Wireless will join the group. Some people were taken aback this week when C Spire, which only has stores in Mississippi, Southwest Alabama and Southwest Tennessee, announced that it will begin carrying the iPhone 4 and 4S on November 11. Among those grumbling over the news were some of T-Mobile USA's 33.6 million subscribers. How, they asked, could a regional carrier get the coveted product before one of the big four? C Spire's infrastructure is based on a cell standard used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, which now both have the iPhone, but it is not common in other countries. C Spire, formerly Cellular South, has a deal with Verizon so that customers who travel outside of its Mississippi home base can still make calls. Since C Spire's network uses the same underpinnings and antenna bands as Verizon, Apple did not have to make modifications to its phones beyond what it already did for Verizon when it launched there in February. An Apple spokeswoman confirmed that C Spire would begin selling the phone next week, but she did not respond to a question about whether the company needed to modify the hardware. The iPhone 4S, Apple's newest gadget, uses a special antenna receiver from Qualcomm that works on typically incompatible networks. \\"IPhone 4S is now a world phone, so both GSM and CDMA customers can roam worldwide on GSM networks,\\" Bob Mansfield, Apple's head of hardware engineering, says in a promotional video. T-Mobile's network runs on the global standard called GSM. AT&T Mobility also uses GSM. That's what makes T-Mobile an attractive takeover target for AT&T, which plans to bolster its own network using T-Mobile cell towers, as long as the merger is approved. (C Spire, along with Sprint, are suing to block the acquisition, saying it will reduce competition.) While AT&T and T-Mobile use the same basic network infrastructure, their cell signals operate on different antenna bands. That prevents T-Mobile from easily making iPhones run on its network. When asked why C Spire got the iPhone before T-Mobile, Brad Duea, a T-Mobile senior vice-president, smiled, having likely fielded the question before. \\"The iPhone already works with their bands,\\" he said in an interview on Wednesday. \\"They didn't have to change anything.\\" Since the original iPhone came out in 2007, owners have been able to take the devices to T-Mobile, swap out a SIM card and use them on the network. But as Apple has added 3G and faster data speeds for AT&T, the unofficial T-Mobile iPhones -- more than a million in all, T-Mobile has said -- have not been able to exceed 2G speeds. AT&T's and T-Mobile's 3G and so-called 4G networks operate on different bands. Another T-Mobile executive, Cole Brodman, recently addressed the issue publicly at a conference and in a letter to customers, though not in great deal. Executives say that, while they'd like to have the iPhone, Android is a fine alternative to the iPhone.

Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed. and the situation: A new volcano is growing underwater.

Step 2: Understand the emotions related to the situation Given the situation, the archaeologist has to work with or is confronted by dishonesty and fraudulence. Because of this, they may feel violated, upset, or disrespected. Step 3: Compare possible answers Let's evaluate the emotions in the given options and see which one fits best in the given context. - Pleasure: This emotion doesn't fit the situation, as the archaeologist is being deceived, and it is unlikely they would feel pleasure in this case. - Awe inspiring: Although finding authentic artifacts can be awe-inspiring, the situation involves fake artifacts, so this emotion is not relevant. - Angry: This emotion corresponds to feeling upset or violated when facing dishonesty, making it a likely option for how the archaeologist may feel in this situation. - Thinking: This is a cognitive process rather than an emotion, so it does not fit as a potential answer. - Painful memories: While the situation might evoke some negative memories, this specific emotion does not directly correspond to the immediate context of dealing with fake artifacts. Step 4: Select the best option Based on the analysis, the best emotion that matches the context of the archaeologist seeing fake artifacts is \\"angry\\".

The government employment statistics continue to astound and confuse. The forecast “consensus” of experts for November was for 85,000 net new jobs—a poor performance if it had happened—but with the East Coast devastated by Hurricane Sandy, it was logical to expect a worse performance than October (138,000 revised down from 171,000). Instead, the BLS reported 147,000 net new jobs with no discernible Sandy effects. Really? But it is not the first time this year that the BLS numbers have confounded analysts and seemed to contradict information from other reliable sources. It’s been crazy enough to get Jack Welch to come out of retirement to express his consternation. All this has been amplified by the politics, with each camp spinning the numbers to suit their goals. When the unemployment rate falls, one side will cite it as evidence that things are improving; the other will point out that it fell because people gave up looking for work and dropped out of the labor force, and that the number of long-term unemployed is exceptionally high. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) conducts monthly surveys of a random sample of its 350,000 members. The November survey provides clear evidence that the employment situation in eight states on the East Coast (excluding western New York and western Pennsylvania, not reached by Sandy), deteriorated significantly. During November, owners in the Sandy states increased employment half as frequently as their counterparts in the rest of the U.S. and reduced employment more frequently. Job openings were 4 points lower and, although the same percentage of owners plan to increase employment (create new jobs), nearly one in five plan reductions in employment compared to only 12 percent in the rest of the country. In 2013, this will improve in Sandy states, as cleanup and new construction and repair needs will increase the demand for workers. But both sets of numbers are “recession readings,” so even without Sandy, the numbers were not good. If the BLS November number is really correct (it will be revised next month), would we have had a very good employment month if Sandy had not joined the party? But that would be inconsistent with just about every regional Federal Reserve report on jobs and the ISM Index. Owner optimism plunged in November (10th lowest reading in 37 years of NFIB survey history), and except for the labor market differences discussed above, Sandy owners were just as bummed out as their counterparts elsewhere in the U.S. Consumer confidence faded in the second half of November and plunged in the first half of December. Pessimistic consumers don’t spend as much and that means employment growth will remain sluggish. Looking ahead to 2013, there is one bright light for employment: new construction. We do produce more GDP today than at the peak in 2007, yet we employ four million fewer workers. Some might attribute that to improved productivity, and the most recent report indicated productivity rising at a 2.9 percent rate, well above historical trends. But the real explanation is a change in the mix of GDP. Housing starts fell from a two million unit annual rate at the end of 2006 to only 500,000. This is a very labor intensive business and that blew a hole in the employment numbers. The missing housing (and related activities) was replaced with manufacturing and agricultural output (the dollar was cheap, exports grew), great for our economy, but not much of a job producer. The population grows by three million every year, and they need a place to live. Housing starts have already recovered to the 900,000 level and will reach well past a million units next year, providing a nice boost to employment. That’s something to build a recovery on, if Washington can just convince us that they will not squander the opportunity and scuttle growth with more bad management decisions. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The most important parts of this news article are as follows: 1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported 147,000 net new jobs in November, with no discernible effects from Hurricane Sandy.

The article highlights the ongoing debate on government employment statistics, where each political camp spins the numbers to suit their goals, creating confusion about the actual state of the job market. 3. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) survey provides evidence that the employment situation in eight East Coast states deteriorated significantly due to Hurricane Sandy.

However, the demand for workers is expected to rise in 2013 due to cleanup and reconstruction efforts. 4.

Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent. Nick Clegg has been accused of 'unbelievable hypocrisy' over a spare room subsidy U-turn. Nick Clegg was accused of ‘unbelievable hypocrisy’ last night after withdrawing support for one of the Government’s flagship welfare policies. The Liberal Democrats demanded significant changes to the spare room subsidy, under which tenants with more bedrooms than they need see their housing benefit reduced. The change of heart is being seen as a Lib Dem tactic to woo Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 election – and a desperate attempt to overturn months of appalling poll ratings. But Labour condemned the move, pointing out that the Tories were only able to introduce the subsidy, dubbed the ‘bedroom tax’ by critics, thanks to Lib Dem votes in the Commons. Tories said they were baffled by the change of heart, saying the Lib Dems had never argued against the measure in private. And it emerged last night that the Lib Dems had been given the chance in March to soften the impact of the ‘bedroom tax’. BBC’s Newsnight programme reported that options were drawn up by civil servants and presented to both coalition parties that would have allowed councils to cushion the impact of benefit cuts under the policy to help people struggling. But the Lib Dems apparently ignored the suggestion. Under the controversial reform, introduced in April 2013, social housing tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced, to tackle what the Government calls a ‘spare room subsidy’. But a government review published this week showed that almost 60 per cent of households affected by the benefit changes were in arrears as a result. And a shortage of smaller homes meant just 4.5 per cent of tenants had been able to downsize to avoid it. Unveiling the U-turn yesterday, Lib Dem Cabinet minister Danny Alexander did not call for the bedroom tax to be scrapped – but said it should be reformed so that no one faces a benefit cut if there is no suitable smaller property available. In addition, he said all disabled claimants should be exempt. Scroll down for video. The Lib Dem change of heart is being seen as a tactic to woo Ed Miliband, pictured, in the run-up to the 2015 election. Mr Clegg has been under pressure to join Labour in opposing the policy since the Lib Dem conference voted overwhelmingly to commit the party to the review of what activists called a ‘reprehensible and evil’ move. Mr Alexander said the issue would be raised with the Tories ahead of George Osborne’s Autumn Statement but if the Lib Dems are not able to secure agreement within government it will be ‘one of the key things in our election manifesto’. Rejecting the accusation of hypocrisy, he said: ‘We are part of the Government and the principle is the right one, which is that people should be paid housing benefit according to the number of rooms that they need. Then and now: Deputy PM Nick Clegg's change of heart over the spare bedroom subsidy. ‘This is about how that policy is applied in practice. It’s about listening to the evidence and significantly adjusting the policy in the light of that evidence.’ Labour’s welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘This is unbelievable hypocrisy from Nick Clegg. There wouldn’t be a bedroom tax if it wasn’t for the Lib Dems.’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said the Lib Dem shift had not been discussed with the Premier or the Chancellor. But Mr Clegg told LBC Radio it was ‘baloney’ for the Tories to claim they were surprised. ‘I’ve been constantly badgering away within government, with the Department for Work and Pensions, to try to make sure we really stress-test this properly.’ Write highlights for this article.","response":"1. Nick Clegg withdraws support for the government's spare room subsidy policy. 2.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Maggie Fox, NBC News The new MERS virus, which has infected 64 people and killed 38 of them, is mostly spread in hospitals and it will take special care to prevent bigger outbreaks, experts reported on Wednesday. An investigation into the outbreak in Saudi Arabia showed 21 people were infected as patients who unknowingly went from one clinic to another, spreading the virus. It can spread quickly in the hospital if strict precautions are not taken – including isolating patients, putting masks on both the patients and the health care workers and strict hand hygiene, the researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. “We saw transmission (between) health care facilities because people would go from one to another and it would not be recognized,” said Dr. Trish Perl of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The problem is there’s not a great test yet for the virus so it’s not always easy to tell who has it, Perl and colleagues reported. The new virus is called MERS, for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. It is a distant cousin of SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus that infected 8,000 people globally, killing nearly 800 of them before it was stopped in 2003. Coronaviruses are a big family and they usually cause common cold-like symptoms in people. But in some cases they can cause very severe infections – and MERS is one of these. Scientists are keeping a very close eye on MERS. “We cannot afford to have another SARS,” Perl told NBC News. It’s already been reported in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy – carried by travelers. And some of those sick have infected other people in the other countries – notably a French patient who infected a roommate in the hospital. Perl and colleagues visited a hospital in Al-Hasa in eastern Saudi Arabia, where one outbreak sickened 23 people in April and May. Out of 217 people living in the same homes as the patients, five became infected, while two hospital workers did. “A total of 21 of the 23 cases were acquired by person to person transmission in hemodialysis units, intensive care units or in-patient units in three different health care facilities,” Perl’s team wrote. Perl and colleagues – including Dr. Allison McGeer of the University of Toronto, who was herself infected by SARS in 2003 -- needed to find out how the virus spread. Because tests for MERS are not very accurate, patients had to be tested over and over before there was a positive test, Perl’s team reported. Once it was clear the virus was spreading, however, hospital officials tightened up their routine and the spread stopped. “They had aggressive hand hygiene, which is key,” Perl said. “We know that proper hand hygiene reduces respiratory viruses by 30 percent.” They also started better use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, she said. “These are not particularly difficult viruses to kill,” she said. Patients with respiratory symptoms were isolated or kept together and away from other patients. Those getting dialysis wore masks and were spread out a bit more than usual from one another. “These are basic tenets for what we would do for influenza or SARS,” Perl said. “People might consider them onerous but they are common-sense things.” MERS has not been seen in the United States, although a handful of travelers have been tested for the virus. Perl said the facilities in Saudi Arabia weren’t much different from similarly rural clinics in the United States. “The place is clean,” she said. “The technology that was available there was similar to what we might find here.” The researchers were not able to determine if MERS spreads before people start showing symptoms. They also couldn’t say if the virus was spread in the air, or in droplets that might be spread between people who are very close to one another or by touching surfaces. \\"Our investigation showed some surprising similarities between MERS and SARS. Both are very deadly viruses and easily transferred between people, and even between health care facilities,\\" Perl said. As with SARS, some people seem to spread the virus more easily than others, she added. Now it is too soon to say if MERS is going to spread as widely as SARS did, Perl says. SARS spread slowly within China for weeks or months before travelers carried it globally. In one notorious instance, an infected traveler became sick and threw up in a Hong Kong hotel. He infected seven other people, who eventually carried the virus to Canada, Vietnam, Singapore and elsewhere in Hong Kong. It could happen again, Perl says. “We have to be careful because we don’t totally know what to expect,” she said. “The one thing I have learned in this business is that respiratory viruses are very difficult to predict.” The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say anyone returning from the Middle East with severe acute respiratory infections should be isolated and tested for MERS. Health care workers who care for them need to use special precautions, including gowns and face masks. ||||| A new virus responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness in the Middle East may be more deadly than SARS, according to a team of infectious disease specialists who recently investigated a set of cases in Saudi Arabia. Of 23 confirmed cases in April, 15 people died — an “extremely high” fatality rate of 65 percent, according to Johns Hopkins senior epidemiologist Trish Perl, a member of the team that analyzed the spread of the virus through four Saudi hospitals. Saudi officials said that as of Wednesday, 49 people have contracted the disease and 32 have died. The infectious disease experts, who published their findings online Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, reported that infection occurred by way of person-to-person contact and poses an especially serious risk because it is easily transmitted in hospital settings. Worldwide, the overall death rate from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus — or MERS-CoV — is at 59 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate is expected to bounce around as new clusters of infection develop. View Graphic MERS: Mild for some, deadly for others The vast majority of MERS-CoV infections have been in Saudi Arabia. No cases have been reported in the United States, but small clusters of infections have appeared in Britain, France, Italy and Tunisia. Since the virus first emerged in April 2012 with two fatal cases in Jordan, 64 people have been infected and 38 have died around the world. The virus comes from the same family as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2003. Both viruses have a distinct haloed appearance when viewed under a microscope, and they typically target the respiratory tract. Like SARS, MERS starts with a fever and mild cough that eventually progress to pneumonia. At first, MERS does not look out of the ordinary compared with other, less serious types of respiratory infection. But Perl said doctors should start taking careful note of a patient’s travel history, since all reported cases have been linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. The team of specialists mapped the likely trail of infection that spanned four Saudi hospitals in just over a month. Patients stationed in the same hospital room or ward as an infected person, or even taken care of by the same nurse, were likely to be exposed to the virus. Out of the 23 infected, hospital patients made up the majority of cases, but the virus also spread to visiting family members and hospital staff. The incubation period of the virus — the time between exposure and development of symptoms — was similar to SARS, about five days. During this period, the researchers warned, infection may be possible. While the high mortality rate is alarming, Perl said that outbreaks tend to have death rates that are high at the beginning but then decline over time as doctors identify patients with milder versions of the illness. She cited the H1N1 and SARS outbreaks as examples. This particular outbreak was largely contained by early detection and isolation of those infected, and through tighter hospital infection-control procedures — steps such as assigning a specific nurse to watch for patients with symptoms, requiring health-care workers to put on face masks and gloves, and fitting masks on patients. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"The new MERS virus has infected 64 people and killed 38 of them.

Translate to English English:","response":"Depending on the workload, these servers may or may not allow external readers. In the context of server management, the availability and performance of a server are crucial factors to consider. While some servers are designed to handle a large number of connections and provide access to users from different sources, others may have limitations in this regard. The decision to allow or disallow external readers largely depends on several factors that are related to the server's purpose and workload capacity. Firstly, the purpose of a server should be taken into account. If a server is designed to provide a specific service to a certain group of users, it might be more restrictive in terms of access, only allowing those users to connect. In contrast, a public server with resources available for general use may grant access to a wider range of users, offering more opportunities for external readers. Secondly, the workload capacity of a server plays an essential role in determining its ability to serve external readers. A server with limited computing power or bandwidth may struggle to accommodate additional users from outside, leading to poor performance or even downtime. In this case, server administrators may choose to limit or deny access to external readers altogether in order to maintain optimal performance for its intended users. On the other hand, a server with ample resources and a well-designed architecture can handle a large number of connections and may not face the same restrictions. In this scenario, granting access to external readers could be more feasible without jeopardizing the server's primary functions and performance. Thirdly, security is another consideration that may affect a server's openness to external readers. In some cases, allowing third-party access to a server might increase the risk of data breaches or cyber attacks. If a server handles sensitive information or is part of a critical infrastructure, server administrators may prioritize security over accessibility, resulting in restricted or denied access for external readers. In conclusion, the decision to allow or disallow access to external readers on a server depends on a combination of factors, including the server's purpose, workload capacity, and security considerations. To maintain optimal performance and protect valuable data, server administrators must carefully assess their server's requirements, ensuring that access is granted only under conditions that do not compromise the server's reliability, security, and functionality."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list.

Among the gifts was a box of knittings for children, knitted and sent by a woman in Toronto. Nurse Austen, was busy, and not feeling too well that winter. She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them. She wanted the woman who had knitted and sent all those lovely knittings \\"to see how much happiness and warmth she had created.\\" Not long after, she received the following answer from Canada. Dear Miss Austen, Your letter made me happy. I did not expect such a full return, I am eighty years old, and I am blind.

Neglecting the importance of the capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city. The Jin assault commenced in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued to sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later. Qinzong, the former emperor Huizong, and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages. They were taken north to Huining , where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners. The former emperors were humiliated by their captors. They were mocked with disparaging titles like \\"Muddled Virtue\\" and \\"Double Muddled\\". In 1128 the Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals.

So, it was one year after Kaifeng was conquered when the Jin made the Song leaders perform the ritual."},{"question":"Which car manufacturer produced models called the Laurel, Maxima and Scarab????","response":"Nissan, a big car company from Japan, made cars with the names Laurel, Maxima, and Scarab. They make many different types of cars that people drive all around the world."},{"question":"\\"given up \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","response":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"given up\\" can be perceived as negative and could evoke a sense of disappointment, defeat, or submission. It implies that someone has stopped trying, abandoned their efforts, or lost hope in achieving a desired outcome. There are several factors that contribute to the overall sentiment of this sentence. The word \\"given\\" is a past participle that implies an action has been granted or offered by someone. When used with \\"up,\\" this sentiment transforms into something that signifies giving in or yielding control of something. The phrasal verb \\"give up\\" on its own often holds negative connotations. In order to provide a detailed analysis, let us consider the following contexts in which the sentence \\"given up\\" can be used. 1. Emotional context: When used in a personal or emotional context, the sentiment might be associated with disappointment, frustration, or sadness. For instance, if a person has \\"given up\\" on finding their dream job or maintaining a relationship, it might imply that they have lost faith in their ability to succeed or in the situation working out positively. 2. Goal-oriented context: In a goal-oriented setting, \\"given up\\" can convey a lack of motivation or willpower to persevere through challenges or setbacks. This may be deemed as a negative sentiment as it can be associated with a lack of determination, ambition, or resilience. For example, if a person has \\"given up\\" on a weight-loss journey, it might indicate that they have stopped putting forth effort and don't believe they can achieve their desired outcome. 3. Social dynamics: In the context of social dynamics, \\"given up\\" can mirror a sense of concession or surrender. When someone uses this phrase in agreements, debates, or negotiations, it might convey that they have stopped fighting for or defending their beliefs or interests, which can hold a negative sentiment if they are yielding to something undesirable or unfavorable. It's important to note that the sentiment of the sentence \\"given up\\" can be influenced by other words or clues in its context. In some cases, it could convey a neutral or even positive sentiment based on the situation, such as giving up a bad habit or giving up one's seat for someone in need. However, without additional context, the sentiment of \\"given up\\" is most commonly perceived as negative."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a review of product in Polish language and a question whether this review has positive sentiment.

It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who chose a broad gauge of -- later slightly widened to -- but, from 1854, a series of amalgamations saw it also operate standard-gauge trains; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892. The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921, which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory, and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways. - The Midlands is a cultural and geographic area roughly spanning central England that broadly corresponds to the early medieval Kingdom of Mercia.

To help them feel better without spending too much money, the government created a plan called 'Medicare.' It is like a magic wand that helps people above the age of 65 pay for visits to the doctor and getting medicine. Now, some people think that this magic wand should also be used for people under the age of 65, which is called 'Medicare Buy-in.' On the other hand, there is another plan called 'Public Option' where anyone, no matter their age, can buy a special card that helps them pay less for their doctor's visits and medicine. However, there are some reasons why the 'Medicare Buy-in' may not be as good as the 'Public Option. ' Here are three main reasons: 1. The Not-So-Happy Doctors and Hospitals: When the old people use the magic wand of Medicare, it pays less money to the doctors and hospitals. So if younger people start using the same magic wand, the doctors and hospitals may not be happy because they will also get paid less. The 'Public Option' doesn't have this problem because with that, doctors and hospitals can make more money. 2. No Fairy Tale for All People: The 'Medicare Buy-in' will only be helpful for people between the ages of 50 and 64. But what about everyone else? They would still need help when they get sick, right? The 'Public Option' plan is like the fairy godmother who helps everyone, no matter how old they are. 3. Money, Money, Money: The Medicare Buy-in plan might make people pay more money than they should to enjoy its benefits. This is not fair, especially if they don't have a lot of money. The 'Public Option' plan is like a gentle giant who makes sure everyone pays what they can afford. So, as we can see, even though the 'Medicare Buy-in' plan sounds like a nice idea, it might not be as good when we look at it closely. The 'Public Option' plan seems to be better because it takes care of everyone and doesn't make doctors and hospitals unhappy. In the end, choosing the best plan is like picking the best ice cream flavor - it depends on what you think is yummy and good for you. Just remember, the health of the people in the United States is very important, and sometimes the best choice isn't always the easiest one."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing. Write the full name if mentioned in the text. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. There would be much to investigate. A few senior officials in the West Wing had access to details of the allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by Mr. Porterâs ex-wives. A greater number of people had a sense that something was amiss but chose to avert their gaze instead of asking questions. The first hours after the issue was brought to light by an article in The Daily Mail were a confused blur with officials like Mr. Kelly at first endorsing Mr. Porter âs resignation but then agreeing to issue statements in support of him . That disarray belied the belief of some in the White House that someone â Mr. Kelly â was finally in charge after six months of drama and infighting in 2017. In reality these officials now concede no one truly was. âThey havenât figured out how the place operates and apparently they donât want to learn â said John Dean a White House counsel under President Richard M. Nixon. The Porter situation he added âis a manifestation of what happens when you have chaos.â Mr. Kelly a four-star Marine general had been billed as uniquely qualified to bring order to Mr. Trumpâs world when he took his post in July. Now he faces a morale crisis in the West Wing where aides describe a sense of betrayal by a chief of staff they no longer trust after his claims that he had not fully known about Mr. Porter âs problems and had acted within minutes once he learned of them. But in the case of Mr. Porter White House aides privately acknowledge some advisers appear to have chosen to try to protect a colleague who was generally well liked and more important too competent to lose. Mr. Trump himself often expressed his regard for Mr. Porter by describing him as âout of central casting.â In the hours after the allegations against Mr. Porter became public some senior officials in fact hesitated to force him out in part because they argued that if one top adviser could be felled by accusations they could all potentially be vulnerable. Mr. Porter denied privately to his colleagues as well as publicly that he had ever physically abused his wives. What distinguished this crisis from the ones that preceded it was that it was not localized to one official such as Stephen K. Bannon the isolated chief strategist who left in August or Reince Priebus the often uninformed chief of staff who departed a month before that. Mr. Porterâs case had spread to so many aspects of the White House that it ensnared a number of staff members. While multiple officials in the West Wing were aware that he had been unable to pass his background check none appear to have made an effort to ascertain precisely why and take action on it. Several former White House counsels have said they would have made it their business to know if an official at Mr. Porterâs level was facing allegations as serious as domestic abuse but officials in the White House have privately maintained that Donald F. McGahn II the White House counsel never did. Yet former White House advisers from both parties have been mystified at the ineptitude of Mr. Trumpâs team in dealing with the fallout from Mr. Porterâs situation.

Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage. Question: It happens _ .

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus \\"Prunus\\") and of some other plants with a similar appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring.

Mr. Spradley, a seven-year veteran at H-P, most recently led efforts separating the company’s IT systems as it split into two entities. Mr. Spradley will replace Ramon Baez, who was appointed senior vice president of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s customer advocacy organization in February, and had served in the role of CIO until now. In this customer-focused role, Mr. Baez will be speaking at conferences and consulting with CIOs on their own IT transformations, CIO Journal reported in August. At the beginning of August, H-P began operating as two separate entities as the company waits for final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Step 2: Research the robot from the 1965 series Based on research, the original robot in the classic 1965 Lost in Space series was known as the Robot, Model B-9. It was created by the series prop-designer Robert Kinoshita. The robot was portrayed as a loyal friend, protector, and member of the Robinson family, who were trying to survive in hostile, unfamiliar territories after their Jupiter 2 spacecraft was sabotaged.

Options: - mean many things - hurt people - hurtful - ring true - fighting Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"In order to answer this question, let's consider the context and options provided. The context is a situation where a bully said mean words. The question is about the potential impact these mean words have on others. Now let's analyze each of the provided options: 1. Mean many things: This seems more like a statement about the ambiguity of language rather than an impact on others in the given context. 2. Hurt people: This is a likely impact, as mean words from a bully can cause emotional distress and hurt the feelings of those targeted or even bystanders who witness the bullying. 3. Hurtful: This option is similar to the previous one but is an adjective. Mean words from a bully could be described as hurtful because they cause emotional pain to others. 4. Ring true: This phrase typically means that something sounds genuine or truthful. In the context of mean words from a bully, this option isn't directly relevant to the impact of those words on others. It might suggest that the mean words struck a chord with someone, but it doesn't clearly indicate an effect on others. 5. Fighting: This option might be relevant in the sense that mean words from a bully could potentially escalate to a physical altercation, but it's not directly indicative of the emotional impact on others. Based on the analysis, the most accurate answer is likely \\"hurt people\\" (option 2), as mean words from a bully can hurt the feelings of those targeted and cause emotional distress among bystanders.

A possible detailed and long answer in English: There could be numerous reasons why someone might not have taken you along. Let's consider a few possibilities and analyze them: 1. Lack of space: It's possible that there wasn't enough room for you to accompany them, due to the limited capacity of the vehicle or the venue they were going to. In such cases, a person often has to prioritize who they can bring along and leave others behind. 2. Incompatibility in interests: People often tend to engage in activities or events that they find enjoyable or relate to their interests. If your interests do not align with theirs, it might make them hesitant to invite you along. 3. Personal preferences: There might be certain people someone prefers to spend time with, based on their personalities, past experiences, or just personal preference. It's worth noting that this is not necessarily a negative reflection on you, as people have different reasons for their choices. 4. Miscommunication: Sometimes, a lack of proper communication can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations, which might result in you not being invited. It's important, in this case, to clarify any misunderstandings and communicate your feelings openly. 5. Unforeseen circumstances: Life occasionally throws curveballs, and unexpected situations might have prevented them from bringing you along. It could be due to a change of plans, an emergency, or any other reason out of their control. 6. Professional boundaries: It might be necessary to maintain professional boundaries in order to avoid potential conflict or misinterpretation if the situation involves a work-related event or decision. In conclusion, the specific reason behind why someone didn't take you along might vary based on numerous factors, and it's essential to consider them all. Keep in mind that having an open and honest conversation with that person can help resolve any confusion or misunderstandings and potentially strengthen the relationship. A possible detailed and long answer in Czech: Důvodů, proč vás někdo nemohl vzít s sebou, může být několik. Pojďme zvážit několik možností a analyzovat je: 1. Nedostatek místa: Je možné, že nebylo dostatek místa, abyste je mohli doprovodit, kvůli omezené kapacitě vozidla nebo místa, kam šli. V takových případech často musí člověk dát přednost tomu, koho může vzít s sebou a koho nechat za sebou. 2. Neodpovídající zájmy: Lidé se často angažují v činnostech nebo akcích, které považují za příjemné nebo související se svými zájmy. Pokud vaše zájmy nesouhlasí s jejich zájmy, mohou váhat s tím, aby vás pozvali. 3. Osobní preference: Někdo může mít určité osoby, se kterými dává přednost trávit čas, na základě jejich osobností, minulých zkušeností nebo prostě osobní preferencí. Stojí za zmínku, že to nutně není negativní obraz o vás, protože lidé mají různé důvody pro svá rozhodnutí. 4. Špatná komunikace: Někdy může nedostatek řádné komunikace vést k nedorozuměním nebo špatným interpretacím, což může vést k tomu, že vás nepozvou. V tomto případě je důležité vysvětlit jakékoli nedorozumění a otevřeně komunikovat své pocity. 5. Nepředvídatelné okolnosti: Život občas přináší neočekávané situace a mohlo dojít k tomu, že vás kvůli změně plánů, nouzovému stavu nebo jiným důvodům mimo jejich kontrolu nemohli vzít s sebou. 6. Profesionální hranice: Může být nutné udržovat profesionální hranice, aby se předešlo možnému konfliktu nebo špatné interpretaci, pokud situace zahrnuje pracovní akci nebo rozhodnutí. Závěrem, konkrétní důvod, proč vás někdo nevzal s sebou, se může lišit na základě mnoha faktorů a je důležité je všechny zohlednit. Mějte na paměti, že otevřený a upřímný rozhovor s touto osobou může pomoci vyřešit jakékoli zmatky nebo nedorozumění a potenciálně posílit vztah."},{"question":"Could JFK appoint RFK as attorney general were he president today? Would ethics laws or rules against nepotism prohibit it? Would Mozart be rich if he were born today? Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"If John F. Kennedy were president today, it is questionable whether he could appoint his brother Robert F. Kennedy as Attorney General due to contemporary ethics laws and rules against nepotism. In 1960, when JFK appointed RFK as Attorney General, there were no specific nepotism laws at the federal level preventing the appointment of a family member to a high-level cabinet position. However, this changed after JFK's presidency. In 1967, Congress enacted an anti-nepotism law, now codified as 5 U.S. Code § 3110. This law prohibits public officials from hiring or promoting relatives to a position in the agency in which the public official serves or exercises control. This rule applies to all three branches of the federal government: executive, legislative, and judicial. There have been a few instances where this law was potentially violated or pushed to its limits, such as President Trump's appointment of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as a White House senior advisor. In that case, the Department of Justice reasoned that the White House was not an \\"executive agency\\" under the statute and found the appointment permissible. However, the Attorney General role in the Department of Justice is squarely within an \\"executive agency,\\" and such an appointment involving siblings could result in greater scrutiny and potentially deemed a violation of the anti-nepotism law. As for Mozart, if he were born today, it is highly likely that he could become wealthy due to his prodigious musical talents and the much larger global market for music that exists now compared to the 18th century when he lived. In the present day, with the availability of streaming services, social media, and the internet as a whole, talented musicians can distribute their music and reach an exponentially larger audience. Mozart would have been able to capitalize on his genius compositions and performances and benefit from concert tours, recording contracts, merchandising, endorsements, and intellectual property rights such as royalties for the usage of his music. The two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is about the feasibility of JFK appointing RFK as the Attorney General under contemporary ethical and legal standards. It focuses on political appointments and the considerations and restrictions surrounding them. The second question is about the hypothetical financial success of a composer and musician, Mozart, if he were born in today's world. It examines how the music industry landscape and modern technology could have impacted his livelihood. In summary, both questions are speculative in nature, but they deal with entirely separate topics. The first question explores the current legal and ethical framework regarding nepotism in politics, and the second question dwells on the potential financial success of a renowned historical figure in the context of today's world."},{"question":"Give a stream of consciousness and then the final answer.

They’ll also be busting people who break the state’s new pot law. They’re calling it “Operation Orange Fingers.” Really. Seattle police will hand out bags of Doritos at Hempfest on Saturday. Police department spokesman Sgt. Sean Whitcomb confirmed the unusual duty, saying he and other officers will distribute one-ounce bags of nacho-cheese chips with educational information affixed to them about the state’s new legal pot law. The bags also will contain a label with a link to the department’s “Marijwhatnow” FAQ, which explains that, yes, adults are now allowed to possess up to an ounce of weed, and that, no, you can’t get back the pot that cops might have seized before voters legalized recreational weed in last November’s election. “A lot of people still have questions about the nuances of the law and 2013 is a year very much in transition for people who enjoy pot,” Whitcomb said. Police are having some fun with the assignment. “Please ignore maliciously false reports that we’re giving out Bugles at @seattlehempfest. We would never, ever do that,” the department tweeted Wednesday. Operation Orange Fingers will be funded by the private Seattle Police Foundation, Whitcomb said. The department expects to give out just 1,000 bags of chips, Whitcomb said. That’s likely to lead to some “Dude, where’s my Doritos?” queries from the 250,000 folks expected to attend the three-day, pro-pot event this weekend at Myrtle Edwards Park on the Seattle waterfront near Belltown. The idea is not to cure the munchies, Whitcomb said, but “to pique their curiosity and get them to go to our FAQ.” Kidding aside, Whitcomb said police will enforce aspects of the new law at Hempfest. He said they would bust minors for consuming in public, which is a misdemeanor. And he said they would bust people dealing pot, which is a felony. Under the new law, only state-licensed stores can sell pot. Because it’s still illegal to consume pot in public, Whitcomb said, officers will give warnings to adults they encounter getting high at Hempfest. That’s not to say people should expect a “task force of undercover officers to infiltrate Hempfest,” he said. But minors “can expect enforcement,” he said, because “it’s a big deal.” Some officers don’t even want to wade into Hempfest, Whitcomb said, because they’re concerned about breathing in secondhand smoke and testing positive for pot. Despite the state law, Seattle officers can’t use pot off-duty because marijuana use remains a federal violation and cops take an oath to uphold federal law, he said. But officers would respond to any emergency, need or request for services, he said. Whitcomb will speak about the department’s pot policies from Hempfest’s main stage Saturday at 2:50 p.m. “The much-coveted 4:20 spot had gone to someone else,” he said. Bob Young: 206-464-2174 or byoung@seattletimes.com ||||| Preamble Preamble The Seattle HEMPFEST® protestival is founded in the belief that the public is better served when citizens and public officials work cooperatively in order to successfully accomplish common goals. Mission To educate the public on the myriad applications of the cannabis plant, the laws about its use, efforts for reform, and conducting business in the new legal environment. ||||| The people have spoken. Voters have passed Initiative 502 and beginning December 6th, it is not a violation of state law for adults over 21 years old to possess up to an ounce of marijuana (or 16 ounces of solid marijuana-infused product, like cookies, or 72 ounces of infused liquid, like oil) for personal use. The initiative establishes a one-year period for the state to develop rules and a licensing system for the marijuana production and sale. Marijuana has existed in a grey area in Seattle for some time now. Despite a longstanding national prohibition on marijuana, minor marijuana possession has been the lowest enforcement priority for the Seattle Police Department since Seattle voters passed Initiative 75 in 2003. Officers don’t like grey areas in the law. I-502 now gives them more clarity. Marijuana legalization creates some challenges for the Seattle Police Department, but SPD is already working to respond to these issues head on, by doing things like reviewing SPD’s hiring practices for police officers to address now-legal marijuana usage by prospective officers, as well as current employees. While I-502 has decriminalized marijuana possession in Washington, the new state law does not change federal law, which classifies marijuana as a Schedule I narcotic. All Seattle Police officers have taken an oath to uphold not only state law, but federal law as well. However, SPD officers will follow state law, and will no longer make arrests for marijuana possession as defined under I-502. The Seattle Police Department and Mayor Mike McGinn have already begun working with state officials to navigate this conflict, and follow the direction of Washington voters to legalize marijuana. In the meantime, the Seattle Police Department will continue to enforce laws against unlicensed sale or production of marijuana, and regulations against driving under the influence of marijuana, which remain illegal. TL;DR? Here’s a practical guide for what the Seattle Police Department believes I-502 means for you, beginning December 6th, based on the department’s current understanding of the initiative Please keep in mind that this is all subject to ongoing state and local review, and that it describes the view of the Seattle Police Department only. All marijuana possession and sale remains illegal under federal law, and Seattle Police cannot predict or control the enforcement activities of federal authorities. Can I legally carry around an ounce of marijuana? According to the recently passed initiative, beginning December 6th, adults over the age of 21 will be able to carry up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use. Please note that the initiative says it “is unlawful to open a package containing marijuana…in view of the general public,” so there’s that. Also, you probably shouldn’t bring pot with you to the federal courthouse (or any other federal property). Well, where can I legally buy pot, then? The Washington State Liquor Control Board is working to establish guidelines for the sale and distribution of marijuana. The WSLCB has until December 1, 2013 to finalize those rules. In the meantime, production and distribution of non-medical marijuana remains illegal. Does I-502 affect current medical marijuana laws? No, medical marijuana laws in Washington remain the same as they were before I-502 passed. Can I grow marijuana in my home and sell it to my friends, family, and co-workers? Not right now. In the future, under state law, you may be able to get a license to grow or sell marijuana. Can I smoke pot outside my home? Like at a park, magic show, or the Bite of Seattle? Much like having an open container of alcohol in public, doing so could result in a civil infraction—like a ticket—but not arrest. You can certainly use marijuana in the privacy of your own home. Additionally, if smoking a cigarette isn’t allowed where you are (say, inside an apartment building or flammable chemical factory), smoking marijuana isn’t allowed there either. Will police officers be able to smoke marijuana? As of right now, no. This is still a very complicated issue. If I apply for a job at the Seattle Police Department, will past (or current) marijuana use be held against me? The current standard for applicants is that they have not used marijuana in the previous three years. In light of I-502, the department will consult with the City Attorney and the State Attorney General to see if and how that standard may be revised. What happens if I get pulled over and an officer thinks I’ve been smoking pot? If an officer believes you’re driving under the influence of anything, they will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition expert. If officers establish probable cause, they will bring you to a precinct and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing. If officers have reason to believe you’re under the influence of something, they can get a warrant for a blood draw from a judge. If you’re in a serious accident, then a blood draw will be mandatory. What happens if I get pulled over and I’m sober, but an officer or his K9 buddy smells the ounce of Super Skunk I’ve got in my trunk? Under state law, officers have to develop probable cause to search a closed or locked container. Each case stands on its own, but the smell of pot alone will not be reason to search a vehicle. If officers have information that you’re trafficking, producing or delivering marijuana in violation of state law, they can get a warrant to search your vehicle. SPD seized a bunch of my marijuana before I-502 passed. Can I have it back? No. Will SPD assist federal law enforcement in investigations of marijuana users or marijuana-related businesses, that are allowed under I-502? No. Officers and detectives will not participate in an investigation of anything that’s not prohibited by state law. December 6th seems like a really long ways away. What happens if I get caught with marijuana before then? Hold your breath. Your case will be processed under current state law. However, there is already a city ordinance making marijuana enforcement the lowest law enforcement priority. I’m under 21. What happens if I get caught smoking pot? It’s a violation of state law. It may referred to prosecutors, just like if you were a minor in possession of alcohol. *This post has been updated since its initial publication to include more legalese and fewer references to narcotics dogs which, as it turns out, are still a confusing, complicated issue still under review. ||||| Seattle polilce plan to hand out Nacho Cheese Doritos this weekend at Hempfest, the world's largest pro-pot rally. (FritoLay) By Casey McNerthney, KIRO 7 STAFF The world’s largest pro-pot rally will be in Seattle this weekend – and police here are handing out free bags of Doritos. The bags of nacho cheese-flavored chips will come with information about Initiative 502, the voter-approved initiative that made small amounts of marijuana legal for adult consumption in Washington. “It’s meant to be funny and ultimately our No. 1 goal is community outreach and public education,” said Sgt. Sean Whitcomb, who also is speaking on a Hempfest stage Saturday. “It totally buys into the stereotype, but in this particular case, we feel that we’ll be getting our message out.” The 1,000 bags of chips are paid for by the Seattle Police Foundation, so taxpayer money isn’t being used, Whitcomb said. “A lot of people are confused and still have questions,” he said of I-502. “We want people to know the rules to follow the law and respect the vote.” The Doritos effort is more attention for a police department that received worldwide attention last November for their question and answer guide called “Marijwhatnow? A Guide to Legal Marijuana Use In Seattle.” The guide had questions such as, “What happens if I get pulled over and I’m sober, but an officer or his K9 buddy smells the ounce of Super Skunk I’ve got in my trunk?” It also included a YouTube video clip from “Lord of the Rings” titled “The Finest Weed.” Hempfest is expected to bring at least 250,000 people over three days. In 1987, McPeak formed the Seattle Peace Heathens Community Action Group, which ultimately grew to form the Hempfest organizing crew. The group organized a Gas Works Park peace vigil in 1990, protesting the Gulf War, and drug advocate Timothy Leary was among the visitors during the six months it lasted. The protesters sang, meditated and one day invited a speaker from a marijuana law-reform group. That evolved into the Washington Hemp Expo in spring 1991, drawing about 500 people to Volunteer Park. When it was renamed Hempfest the following year, attendance quadrupled. By 1993 the festival had 5,000 people. That year also had a “Bong-a-Thon,\\" but few problems with police. The citations for marijuana came at the 1997 Hempfest when about 60 people were ticketed. But no citations were issued in the last two years, which drew crowds of roughly 300,000 people. Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn was among the many speakers at the 2011 Hempfest. A month after the 2003 Hempfest, Seattle voters passed an initiative making the investigation, arrest and prosecution of marijuana offenses, when the drug was intended for adult personal use, the lowest law enforcement priority.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nintendo Co. Ltd. raised its 2004 shipment target for its DS handheld video game device by 40 percent to 2.8 million units on Thursday after many stores in Japan and the United States sold out in the first week of sales.","response":"This passage is discussing the success of Nintendo's DS handheld video game device in 2004, particularly in Japan and the United States. As a result of strong sales, Nintendo has raised its shipment target for that year by 40%, planning to ship 2.8 million units to meet the high consumer demand. This information highlights the popularity of the device during the initial launch period and indicates a positive market response from consumers. To dive deeper into this matter, let's break down the context and background of the Nintendo DS and the possible reasons for its success. The Nintendo DS (Dual Screen) is a handheld video game console developed and released by Nintendo in 2004. It is the successor to the popular Game Boy Advance, and it was introduced as a revolutionary device with two LCD screens, one of which could be used as a touchscreen. This innovation provided unique gameplay experiences and set it apart from other handheld gaming devices in the market. The Nintendo DS was also backward compatible with Game Boy Advance titles, which is a bonus for customers who already owned a library of GBA games. There are several factors that contributed to the success of Nintendo DS sales during its initial launch: 1. Innovative design and features: As mentioned earlier, the Nintendo DS offered users a unique gaming experience with its dual-screen setup and touchscreen controls. This innovative design appealed to avid gamers who were interested in pushing the boundaries of handheld gaming. 2. Strong marketing and promotion: Nintendo conducted an effective marketing campaign for the DS that generated excitement among consumers and ultimately led to high demand. The DS was marketed as a device offering new and innovative gameplay possibilities, which attracted the attention of casual and committed gamers alike. 3. High-profile game titles: During its launch window, the Nintendo DS had several popular and well-regarded titles available, such as Super Mario 64 DS, Nintendogs, and The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. These exclusive titles provided consumers with strong incentives to purchase the DS. 4. Positive word-of-mouth and media coverage: The high demand for the Nintendo DS and the subsequent sell-out of devices in Japan and the United States garnered significant media attention, which reinforced the positive perception of the product and encouraged more consumers to purchase it. 5. Successful past products: Nintendo's reputation for producing quality gaming devices, such as the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo 64, instilled confidence in potential buyers that the DS would follow in the footsteps of its successful predecessors. In summary, the passage is describing the success of the Nintendo DS handheld video game console in 2004. With strong sales in Japan and the United States, Nintendo raised its shipment target to 2.8 million units. Factors such as innovative design, effective marketing, high-profile game titles, positive word-of-mouth, and Nintendo's reputation contributed to the heightened demand for the DS during its initial launch."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Set during the American Civil War, the story focuses on Charlotte Lovell and her cousin Delia, whose wedding day is disrupted when her former fiance Clem Spender returns following a two-year absence. Delia proceeds to marry Jim Ralston, and Charlotte comforts Clem, who enlists in the Union Army and is later killed in battle. Shortly after his death, Charlotte discovers she is pregnant with Clem's child, and in order to escape the stigma of an illegitimate child, she journeys West to have her baby, a daughter she names Clementina (or \\"Tina\\"). Following the end of the war, Charlotte and Tina relocate to Philadelphia, where Charlotte opens an orphanage. Delia is the mother of two children, and Charlotte is engaged to marry Joe Ralston, her cousin's brother-in-law. On her wedding day, Charlotte tells Delia that Tina is her child by Clem, and Delia stops Joe from marrying Charlotte by telling him that she is in poor health. The cousins become estranged, but when Jim is killed in a horse riding accident, Delia invites Charlotte and Tina to move in with her and her children. Tina, unaware Charlotte is her birth mother, assumes the role of Delia's daughter and calls Charlotte her aunt. Fifteen years pass, and Tina is engaged to wealthy Lanning Halsey.

(B). dynamic equilibrium. (C). metabolism. (D). camouflage.The answer is:","response":"In order to determine the correct answer to the given question, let's analyze each option step by step and justify whether it is the main cause of naturally occurring variations within a species or not. (A) Sexual reproduction: Sexual reproduction involves the recombination of genetic material from two parents, resulting in offspring with a unique combination of genes. This process increases genetic diversity and is a major source of variation within a species. This option seems likely. (B) Dynamic equilibrium: Dynamic equilibrium refers to a state in which opposing forces or processes maintain a balance, such as population size or chemical reactions. It does not directly contribute to genetic diversity or variation within a species. (C) Metabolism: Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions that occur within an organism to maintain life. Although metabolism is essential for life, it does not directly contribute to genetic variation within a species. (D) Camouflage: Camouflage is a way for organisms to blend in with their surroundings as an adaptation for survival. While it is a result of genetic variation, it does not directly cause the genetic variation itself. Looking at our analysis of each option, the main source of naturally occurring variations within a species is (A) sexual reproduction. This is because the exchange and recombination of genetic material during sexual reproduction directly leads to increased genetic diversity and the creation of unique offspring."},{"question":"Sentence: The BBC is located in London.

By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

Context: Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing. It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“.

The captured soldier liked the cage better than the cell, because the","response":"cage provided him with a sense of connection to the outside world, maintaining a level of mental and emotional stability that exceeded what he could achieve in the isolated confines of the cell. Firstly, the cage allowed natural light to filter in and illuminate his space, which had a significant impact on his overall well-being. Exposure to sunlight is essential, as humans have an intrinsic need for it; sunlight helps regulate sleep patterns, produce vital nutrients such as vitamin D, and boost mood. The cell, by contrast, only had artificial lighting, which could not provide the same health benefits. Ultimately, the cage's exposure to daylight helped the captured soldier maintain a sense of normalcy and kept his spirits up. Secondly, the design of the cage, with its bars, offered a view of the surrounding environment that the confinement of a solid-walled cell could not. The ability to observe the world outside of his imprisonment was comforting to the soldier, who could at least watch the changes in weather, notice the natural beauty of his surroundings, and observe any other living creatures that happened to pass by. This served as a reminder that there was still a world outside of his captivity, providing hope that he could one day return to it. The solace derived from these observations helped the soldier to feel less isolated in his plight. Moreover, the openness of the cage granted the captured soldier an opportunity to communicate with other prisoners who might be held nearby. Engaging in social interactions is a basic human need and one that can promote mental resilience in the face of adversity. In contrast, the walls of the cell might muffle or completely stifle any potential verbal exchanges with fellow detainees, leaving the soldier feeling utterly alone. Additionally, the cage provided better ventilation, allowing fresh air to circulate more efficiently than it would in a cell. Access to clean air is vital for maintaining respiratory health and can contribute to an overall sense of cleanliness, even when living conditions might be otherwise far from ideal. The cell, on the other hand, would collect stale air, dampness, and potential odors from bodily functions, making it a significantly less habitable and more distressing environment. Lastly, the cage's structure enabled the soldier to maintain a heightened level of awareness in his surroundings. This offered a certain level of psychological comfort, as the soldier was able to better anticipate any threats or dangers entering his confined space. In contrast, the cell's walls blocked such awareness, leaving the soldier vulnerable to surprises and the fear that can come with a lack of control over one's environment. In conclusion, the captured soldier favored the cage over the cell due to the various physical and psychological benefits it provided. The access to sunlight, views of the outdoors, opportunities for communication with others, better ventilation, and increased situational awareness all contributed to a more tolerable living situation despite the inherent challenges of confinement. In the face of adversity and uncertainty, these factors undeniably played a vital role in preserving the soldier's mental and emotional stability."},{"question":"Article:Her annual message to the association addressed its 2016 theme - inclusivity.

Options: (A) 3 sec (B) 4 sec (C) 5 sec (D) 6 sec (E) 7 sec What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: (C)?","response":"To arrive at the answer (C), we can follow these step-by-step reasoning process: Step 1: Convert the speed of the train from kmph (kilometers per hour) to meters per second (m/s). To do this, we can use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / (60 * 60) seconds = 5/18 m/s Step 2: Convert the speed of the train to m/s. Given speed = 39 kmph Speed in m/s = 39 * (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 65 / 6 m/s Step 3: Calculate the time taken to pass a telegraph post. The train has to cover a distance of its own length (56 m) to completely pass the post. To find the time taken, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Step 4: Substitute the given values into the formula and solve for time. Time = 56 m / (65 / 6) m/s Time = 56 * 6 / 65 Time = 336 / 65 Time ≈ 5.169 Step 5: Round the calculated time to the nearest whole number.

For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... I am facing a new situation today: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would item B have higher or lower specific gravity than item A? A:","response":"Item B, which is a sample of surface rock, would have a lower specific gravity than item A, which represents the Earth. The specific gravity of the Earth as a whole is 5.515, while typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface ranges from 2.7 to 3.3. This difference implies that materials deeper within the Earth are denser than those found at the surface, as the overall specific gravity is greater than that of the surface rocks."},{"question":"(1) After all , the global stiffness matrix is constructed by adding together the individual expanded element matrices .

Sarah Griffiths. High speed cameras allow researchers to see things that they would normally miss, from the beating wings of a hummingbird to how a boat cuts through water. Now researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The device uses a new technique to take high-speed images so it can capture chemical reactions and heat conduction, which were impossible to photograph before. Researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The large machine contains a pulse source, temporal and spatial mapping devices and an image sensor (illustrated) to take high resolution photographs at the rate of 4.4 trillion frames a second. The new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. It visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile’. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera, while still being able to produce high resolution images. The previous fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’ where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then ‘probed’ for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image. Up until now, the fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’, where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then probed for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image, Phys.org reported. But this technique relies on repetitive measurements to construct an image. Instead, the new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. The camera visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile,’ according to the journal Nature Photonics. It was developed by scientists at the University of Tokyo and Keio University in Japan. The new camera will make it possible for scientists to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. One day it could also be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of computer chips (pictured) including their tiny semiconductors. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera. It has high pixel resolution of 450 x 450 pixels to provide scientists with a lot of detail about the object they are photographing. The new camera is called Sequentially Timed All-optical Mapping Photography (Stamp) and will be used to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. It has taken three years to develop and the next step is make the device smaller, as it measures around three square feet (one square metre). The experts who developed the machine believe it could one day be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of semiconductors, for example. The computer chip components are tiny and by looking at detailed images of the manufacturing process, experts might be able to spot opportunities to make efficiencies. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"1. Researchers in Japan have developed the world's fastest camera, capable of taking 4.4 trillion images per second. 2.

Susan and her friend David mock and crumple up the card, prompting an enraged Harold to break into the house, and kill David by hanging him from a hatstand. Nineteen years later, Susan is divorced, has a daughter, and a new boyfriend named Jack. On Valentine's Day, Susan has Jack take her to a hospital to pick up test results, and on the way into the building, she is observed from a window by a man in surgical garb. The man strokes a photograph of a young Susan, and sabotages the elevator Susan boards in order to delay her while he kills the doctor who has her paperwork, which the murderer tampers with. A janitor finds the doctor's body, and has his face dunked into a sink full of acid by the killer. While looking for the doctor, Susan coerces a friendly intern named Harry into getting her results, which Harry notices are abnormal, prompting him to bring them and Susan to Doctor Saxon. The peculiarities of Susan's paperwork (which the murderer further sabotages after killing a pair of laboratory workers) cause Doctors Saxon and Beam to order that she be detained for observation.

Hrolfr Kraki, Hrodulf, Rolfo, Roluo, Rolf Krage (early 6th century) was a legendary Danish king who appears in both Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian tradition. His name would in his own language (Proto-Norse) have been *Hrothiwulfaz (famous wolf). Both traditions describe him as a Danish Scylding, the nephew of Hrodgar and the grandson of Healfdene. The consensus view is that Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian traditions describe the same people. The Chronicon Lethrense and the included Annales Lundenses tell that Haldan (Healfdene) had two sons, Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hrodgar). When Haldan died of old age, Helghe and Ro divided the kingdom so that Ro ruled the land, and Helghe the sea. One day, Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro's farmers. This resulted in a daughter named Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf. Eventually, Helghe found out that Yrse was his own daughter and, out of shame, went east and killed himself. Both Helghe and Ro being dead, a Swedish king, called Hakon in the Chronicon Lethrense proper, and Athisl in the Annales - corresponding to Eadgils - forced the Danes to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Rolf Krage. Rolf Krage was a big man in body and soul and was so generous that no one asked him for anything twice. His sister Skulda was married against Rolf's will to Hartwar or Hiarwarth (Heoroweard), a German earl of Skane, but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden. This Hartwar arrived in Zealand with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed Rolf together with all his men. Only one survived, Wigg, who played along until he was to do homage to Hartwar. Then, he pierced Hartwar with a sword, and so Hartwar was king for only one morning.

It seemed as if my night of reckless fun and indulgence had finally caught up with me, and my body was desperate to purge the toxins residing within. My head pounded with a steady rhythm, as if it was trying to physically beat sense into me for the irresponsible decisions I had made the night before. The cold sweat of regret clung to my brow, and my once chatty friends were now reduced to silent, motionless, and equally miserable heaps scattered around the cozy hotel room. Somehow, in the entangled mess of regret, pain, and embarrassment, the porcelain toilet became our sanctuary, a glowing beacon of relief in the midst of the self-inflicted whirlwind of chaos. Sitting on the cold bathroom floor provided a small, albeit temporary, reprieve from the slow roasting inferno that my mind had become. Crawling to the toilet seemed like a pilgrimage, a desperate plea for forgiveness from a higher power for the barrage of intoxicating substances ingested. But the toilet did not judge, nor did it show resentment. It stood there, patiently bracing itself for the incoming hurl storm. The night progressed sluggishly, the room scented with an intoxicating mixture of shame, sorrow, and the lingering odors of cheap alcohol mixed with bile. The low murmurs of tentative conversation pierced through the air periodically, as each person found solace in recounting the events leading up to their inevitable downfall or the fleeting moments of hilarity that intoxicated antics often provide. Despite the excruciating pain and waves of nausea that washed over me, every flush of the toilet felt like a metaphorical cleanse, a fresh start from the physical and emotional remnants of the previous night. It was bizarre, that amidst the haze of a throbbing headache and constant queasiness, a sense of bonding and camaraderie had begun to form between us – our shared debauchery united us in a way only the aftermath of such an event can. As the hours slowly dragged on and the sun began to peek through the hotel room curtains, the agony of the hangover began to loosen its grip on our weary bodies. Through sips of water and concoctions of hangover remedies, we managed to regain a semblance of our former selves, and the room once again filled with laughter – albeit with groans of residual pain accompanying each chuckle. We wondered aloud whether or not we would learn our lesson this time around or if we would inevitably find ourselves in the same position sometime in the future. The toilet, which had once been nothing more than an everyday object to us, now took on new meaning. It had served as our refuge, our vessel of redemption, and our humbling reminder of the power and folly of overindulgence. The events of that long night hugging the toilet will forever be etched in our memories, serving as both a grim warning of our susceptibility to reckless decision-making and a testament to our time shared – and survived – together."},{"question":"Answer the following question.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","response":"When evaluating the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"She has problem enough as it is,\\" one needs to consider factors such as grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. In essence, linguistic integrity refers to how well a sentence adheres to the established rules and principles of a particular language—in this case, English. 1. Grammar: Grammatical rules cover various aspects of language structure like word formation, part-of-speech agreements, and tense consistency. The sentence at hand contains a minor grammatical issue: it ought to have been \\"She has enough problems,\\" instead of \\"She has problem enough.\\" The correct version uses the plural form \\"problems\\" and places \\"enough\\" before the noun. 2. Syntax: Syntax refers to the organization and arrangement of phrases and clauses within a sentence. The syntax of the sentence in question is clear and comprehensible, despite its grammatical flaw. The subject \\"She\\" is followed by the verb \\"has,\\" which indicates that the sentence maintains a standard subject-verb-object structure. Nevertheless, the adverb \\"enough\\" is positioned awkwardly when it should be placed directly before the noun \\"problems.\\" 3. Semantics: Semantics concerns how meaning is extracted from words, phrases, and sentences. Though the sentence has both grammatical and syntactic imperfections, its meaning can still be inferred: the subject, described as a female, has a sufficient number of problems to deal with. As such, the sentence passes the semantics test. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics involves the broader context in which language is used and the social implications of speech. The phrase \\"as it is\\" enhances the sentence's pragmatic aspect by reinforcing the notion that the subject's existing circumstances are already problematic, making the sentence emotionally charged and indicating empathy or understanding towards the subject's situation. Taking all these factors into account, one could argue that the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"She has problem enough as it is\\" is not perfect. Although the sentence structure and overall context are clear, there is a minor grammatical issue which, if corrected, could enhance its clarity and accuracy. In its current form, the sentence might be deemed acceptable in casual or colloquial communication, but it would be less appropriate in formal or academic settings. To achieve better linguistic integrity, the sentence should be revised to: \\"She has enough problems as it is.\\""},{"question":"A text is given in Marathi.

About half of the Superdome's lights go out during the third quarter of Super Bowl XLVII. An Entergy official says the problem is tied to the dome; the rest of New Orleans \\"is fine\\" Play resumes after a roughly 34-minute break; NFL says it's investigating the cause.","response":"Title: Super Bowl XLVII: Ravens Emerge Victorious Amidst Superdome Blackout Drama The 47th annual Super Bowl, held on February 3, 2013, saw the Baltimore Ravens clash with the San Francisco 49ers in a match that ended 34-31 in favor of the Ravens. However, the nail-biting competition at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans was not the only headline of the night. As the teams were battling it out on the field, nearly half of the stadium plunged into darkness during the third quarter. Tensions ran high during the third quarter when an unexpected blackout affected approximately half of the Superdome's lights for a duration of 34 minutes. The sudden outage brought the game to a standstill and left millions of viewers eager to find out what transpired. The situation prompted an intriguing blend of confusion, bewilderment, and anticipation that would become etched into the memories of both the players and fans alike. While initial reports suggested that the city of New Orleans faced a ghostly predicament due to Super Bowl XLVII's blackout, Entergy, the local power company responsible for providing electricity to the city, later clarified the issue. An Entergy official informed the public that the unexpected mishap stemmed from the stadium itself, asserting that the \\"rest of New Orleans [was] fine.\\" With the power outage resolved after much deliberation and hard work by stadium technicians and electricians, play resumed following the 34-minute break. Despite having lost precious time and faced newfound challenges in the game's momentum, the San Francisco 49ers rallied and pushed for a comeback. However, their efforts ultimately fell short, with the Baltimore Ravens securing a 34-31 victory. The result marked their second Super Bowl championship, following their triumphant performance in the 2000 season. In the aftermath of this dramatic event, the NFL released a statement acknowledging the incident and expressing their intent to investigate the root cause. Their objective was to understand what led to the partial blackout at the iconic Superdome, which had previously hosted six Super Bowls and achieved a considerable amount of fame and recognition. The league sought to avoid any reoccurrence by identifying the problem, taking proactive measures, and implementing an improved security plan. As a testament to the resilience of professional athletes and the power of human determination, Super Bowl XLVII will forever be remembered as a game that showcased the unwavering spirit of both the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers' valiant fightback, coupled with the Ravens' spectacular display of steely resolve, strength, and strategy, turned the face-off into an instant classic. The thrilling match bore witness to the teams overcoming the hurdles of an unprecedented power outage, unrelenting competition, and unfathomable pressure. In conclusion, Super Bowl XLVII will go down in history as a unique edition that entertained and captivated audiences as few others have. From its rollercoaster of emotions to the incredible drama unfolding within and outside the stadium, it was truly one for the ages and a lasting reminder of the heights that competitive sports can reach."},{"question":"Information: - Twitter is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages, \\"tweets,\\" restricted to 140 characters.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

Rationale: S = (90 + 60)/2 = 75 kmph The question and answer:","response":"Question: What is the average speed of a car that travels 90 kmph for half of the distance and 60 kmph for the other half? Answer: To find the average speed, we need to determine the total distance covered and the total time taken. Let's assume the total distance to be '2d'. Now, the car travels 'd' distance at 90 kmph and 'd' distance at 60 kmph. First, we'll calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey. Time taken at 90 kmph: t1 = Distance / Speed t1 = d / 90 Time taken at 60 kmph: t2 = Distance / Speed t2 = d / 60 Now, let's find the total time taken (T) by adding the time taken for both segments: T = t1 + t2 T = (d / 90) + (d / 60) To find the average speed (S), we divide the total distance by the total time: S = (2d) / T By substituting T from the previous equation: S = (2d) / [(d / 90) + (d / 60)] After solving for 'S', we get: S = (90 + 60) / 2 = 75 kmph So, the average speed of the car is 75 kilometers per hour."},{"question":"Data: name = Cotto, customer rating = 5 out of 5, customer rating = average, near = The Portland Arms.

Options: - louisiana - oregon - pet store - tropical forest - blue ridge mountains The answer is \\"oregon\\" because Answer:","response":"Oregon and Blue Ridge Mountains are the correct answers. Oregon is home to several mountains like the Cascade Range, Klamath Mountains, and others where various species of snakes can inhabit. The state has about 15 species of snakes, including the common garter snake, northwestern garter snake, western rattlesnake, and others that could be found in its mountainous regions. Additionally, the Blue Ridge Mountains, which extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania, also have a diverse range of snake species who inhabit the mountains. Some of these include the timber rattlesnake, northern copperhead, eastern cottonmouth, and several others. A pet store could theoretically house a snake that could thrive in a mountainous environment, however, it's not a geographical location where one would naturally find a snake. Louisiana, while it does have snakes, is largely flat and does not feature any notable mountain ranges where one might find a snake. A tropical forest might contain snakes, but it's not typically what one would think of when imagining a mountainous environment. The conditions in a tropical forest would be remarkably different from a mountainous region.

Bill preceded John in the long line of Susan's husbands.","response":"Yes, the word \\"precede\\" has the same fundamental meaning in both sentences, but it is applied in different contexts. \\"Precede\\" means to come before something else in time, rank, or position. In both sentences, it indicates that one thing or person comes before another in a sequence or order. In the first sentence, \\"Stone tools precede bronze tools,\\" the meaning of \\"precede\\" is used in a historical context. It suggests that stone tools were used before the invention of bronze tools, coming earlier in time during the development of human technology. This is an observation of the progression of tool-making materials, as stone tools were indeed used in prehistoric times before humans discovered how to make tools out of metal. In the second sentence, \\"Bill preceded John in the long line of Susan's husbands,\\" the meaning of \\"precede\\" is used in a personal and relational context. It implies that Bill was married to Susan before John, occupying an earlier position in the sequence of Susan's relationships. In this case, \\"precede\\" refers to the chronological order of Susan's marriages, highlighting that Bill was one of her husbands before John. So, while the word \\"precede\\" maintains the same fundamental meaning in both sentences - indicating that something comes before something else - the context differs, with the first sentence applying to the historical progression of human technology and the second one focusing on the chronological order of personal relationships."},{"question":"Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Acting as a referee is a relevant and logical role for the third person to assume. 2. Option [i] could be possible in a broader setting, but it is not directly related to the ongoing foosball game and seems out of place. 3. Option [ii] is unlikely because it suggests that one of the players suddenly loses control of their arm, which is not a usual or logical event during a foosball game. 4.

In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot. You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. The plot revolves around Carlito (Carlos Sanz), who leads a wealthy and influential Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles. Worried about the encroachment of a group of heavily-armed members of the Chinese mafia, Carlito orders the contract killing of their leader, Don Kim (Keone Young). Carlito's best hitman, a British man called Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), is ordered to do the job. However Carlito underestimated the Chinese and after the hit, the anger of the Chinese is much greater than Carlito expected. Carlito regrets the hit, deeming it \\"ill-advised\\", and to ease the pressure Carlito offers the Chinese an explanation and a solution: the hit was nothing to do with him, and Carlito will remove certain elements within his own organization who were responsible and operating on their own.Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), a small time criminal and long-time rival of Chelios, uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios, unknown to Chelios who believes Carlito is still loyal to him. While Chelios sleeps in his apartment one night, Verona breaks in and injects Chelios with the \\"Beijing Cocktail\\". This is a synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline from the adrenal glands, slowing the heart, and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recorded video explaining that Chelios should only have about an hour left before the poison stops his heart.Chelios phones Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam) who often works as a personal physician to the Mafia, who informs Chelios that in order to survive and keep his heart beating he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, or get some artificial adrenaline, epinephrine. With his own adrenaline keeping the poison at bay at first, Chelios breaks into a hospital and steals numerous drugs, much more than Doc Miles advises him to take and also being \\"juiced\\" by hits from a defibrilator. He must keep his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts such as picking fights with other gangsters, stealing things, committing robberies, fighting with police and driving cars through shopping malls.The entire film takes place in a single day. Over the course of the day Chelios sets out to get his revenge on Verona, knowing that he probably will not make it to the end of the day, and attempting to find Verona and his street gang through Chelios' street contact Kaylo (Efren Ramirez), a flamboyant homosexual. Chelios also goes to pick up his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) before Verona's thugs get to her. Chelios has sex with Eve in the middle of a busy street in Chinatown while hundreds of people look on, in order to keep his adrenaline up.In the end it is revealed that Chelios spared Don Kim's life and told him to leave LA. Towards the end of the film, Chelios arranges a rooftop meeting with Carlito, Verona and their henchmen, who promise him a fake antidote. Don Kim arrives along with his Triads to assist Chelios, and in a shootout many of Carlito's men are killed. Carlito is killed by an ambitious and treacherous Verona, who then attempts to leave in Carlito's helicopter. The film concludes with Chelios confronting Verona in the helicopter and as they fight the pair fall from the chopper thousands of feet above LA, and mid-flight Chelios breaks Verona's neck. He then calls Eve on his cell phone, apologizing that he will not be coming back to her. Chelios hits a car, bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera. In the last shot it is implied that his adrenaline is indeed still flowing fast; his nostrils flare, he blinks, and two heartbeats are heard.","response":"Task explanation: The task requires reading a movie plot extract and then creating well-formed, grammatically correct questions based on the passage.

La Pitchoune or 'La Peetch' was the summer home of Paul and Julia Child for nearly 3 decades. Built on the homestead of Simone Beck, known as Bramafam, La Pitchoune was the house 'Built on Friendship'. Julia Child, after the death of her beloved, left La Pitchoune back with the Beck family. Soon after, Kathie Alex moved in and rented from Simone Beck. In the early 1990's, she purchased La Pitchoune, and turned into a beloved cooking school and experience, Cooking With Friends. After a near decade hiatus, La Peetch returned to her roots as a center for culture, food, and community in 2016 after a bright eyed young Smith graduate (just like Julia) bought La Pitchoune from Kathie Alex. Pitchounians, as they have been called for decades (although we've taken to calling them Pitchunicorns), return year after year and already we've had return visitors ourselves.

Would the Titanic be well preserved at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland?","response":"Rationale: Shipwrecks generally tend to be well preserved in cold, deep water with limited oxygen and physical disturbances. The Gulf of Finland has relatively cold waters and is not as deep as the Atlantic Ocean where the Titanic sank. Moreover, there could be more oxygen circulation and human activity in the area, which could affect preservation. Answer: The Titanic might not be as well preserved if it were located at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland, compared to its current location in the deep, cold waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. Factors such as depth, temperature, oxygen levels, and human activity would likely negatively impact its preservation in the Gulf of Finland."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces ( '{{ ... }}' ).

The music teacher was a good influence, but the book was awful. This book is grossely overrated. I highly recommend that you don't read this book. Answer: Answer:","response":"After thoroughly analyzing the given product review, it is evident that the reviewer has a negative perception of the book. There are multiple indications in the text that support this conclusion. Firstly, the title itself, \\"Horrible book,\\" implies that the reviewer was disappointed with the book and did not appreciate its content or value. The use of an extreme adjective like \\"horrible\\" reveals a strong negative sentiment. Secondly, the reviewer expresses their desire to give the book no stars, which further emphasizes their dissatisfaction and the lowest possible rating. This statement indicates that they believe the book is not worth any positive recognition. Thirdly, the phrase \\"how anybody can enjoy this book is beyond me\\" indicates the reviewer's inability to understand how anyone could find the book enjoyable or valuable. This statement demonstrates a lack of connection with individuals who may have a different perspective on the book and adds to the overall negative impression the reviewer has. Although the reviewer acknowledges the music teacher as a good influence, this positive aspect does not outweigh the overwhelming negativity expressed in the review. The reviewer argues that the book is \\"grossely overrated,\\" suggesting that they firmly believe it does not deserve the praise or recognition it may have received from other readers or critics. Finally, the reviewer concludes their review with a strong recommendation against reading the book. This reinforces the overall negative sentiment and their firm stance that the book is not worth the time and effort of potential readers. In summary, this product review is decidedly negative. The reviewer uses strong negative language, emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the book, questions the opinions of others who may have enjoyed it, and ultimately advises against reading the book. All these factors paint a clear picture of a reviewer who did not find value in the book and wants to dissuade others from engaging with it, confirming that the review is negative."},{"question":"What is a shorter version of this: the european union 's newest members risk losing some of the funds reserved for them in the bloc 's joint budget because they are failing to use it quickly enough , the european commission said monday .

He is the youngest of four children, with two brothers, Domingo and Dean, and a sister, Maisha. His mother, Elsie Harriet (Banks), is a middle-school choir teacher at Roxboro Middle School in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. His father, Lindberg Styles Mescudi, was a house painter, substitute teacher and World War II Air Force veteran. Kid Cudi's musical style has been described as \\"an atmospheric take on melodic rap, with a dollop of charming, off-key singing\\". He has also been called \\"introspective, with the ability to lay his insecurities on record and expose his fallibility.\\" In 2015, Kris Ex of Billboard, wrote \\"he's always been an emotional artist, dealing with expansive and nebulous feelings in acute and often destructive ways.\\" Kid Cudi's sound is what inspired and led Kanye West to create his cathartic 808s & Heartbreak (2008), with West later stating that he and Cudi were \\"the originators of the style, kinda like what Alexander McQueen is to fashion.... Everything else is just Zara and H&M.\\" West also complimented Cudi by saying, \\"His writing is just so pure and natural and important.\\" In March 2014, Cudi talked about wanting to provide guidance for young listeners with his music: \\"my mission statement since day one [...] all I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone, and stop committing suicide.\\" In a 2013 article for The BoomBox, the author wrote: \\"On [A Kid Named Cudi], Cudi raps and croons over samples and interpolations of Gnarls Barkley, Paul Simon, Band of Horses, J Dilla, Nosaj Thing, N.E.R.D. and Outkast. He melded indie rock, electronica and dubstep seamlessly with hip-hop without pandering or reaching. Before Drake broke through with 2009's So Far Gone, rapping and singing over Swedish indie poppers Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John, Cudi tweaked with multi-genre covers and seamless transitions between singing and rapping.\\" In a 2009 interview with HipHopDX, when speaking on his debut album Cudi stated: \\"Well one thing I wanted to do was combine sounds that really bring out intense moods.\\" Kid Cudi's music has also been described as trip hop. Furthermore, he is known for harmonizing and humming in his music, which helps formulate his signature sound. On 2011's WZRD and 2015's Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, Cudi incorporated the use of screamed vocals, and can be heard yodeling on his 2016 album Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'. Throughout the years he has also incorporated elements of psychedelia, R&B, electronica, synthpop and grunge, in his music.

Which surface will let the flatbed truck travel a greater distance? (A) landfill (B) parking lot. What is the most sensical answer between \\"landfill\\" and \\"parking lot\\"? Answer:","response":"To determine the most sensical answer between \\"landfill\\" and \\"parking lot,\\" let's consider the factors that affect a flatbed truck's ability to travel a greater distance on each surface. 1. Surface conditions: A landfill typically has an uneven and rough surface, with obstacles like garbage, debris, and soft ground. In contrast, a parking lot has a smooth and well-maintained surface, free of major obstacles. The flatbed truck would face less resistance and fewer obstacles on a parking lot, making it easier to drive. 2. Traction and tire wear: The rough and uneven surface of a landfill can cause poor traction and increased tire wear, thus decreasing the truck's efficiency and ability to travel long distances. On the other hand, a parking lot offers better traction and minimal tire wear, allowing for a more efficient and longer drive. 3. Fuel efficiency: On a landfill, the truck would need to maneuver more to avoid obstacles and cope with the unstable ground, ultimately consuming more fuel. In contrast, the parking lot would allow for a more consistent and fuel-efficient drive. Considering these factors, the most sensical answer is (B) parking lot. The parking lot provides the flatbed truck with a smoother surface, better traction, and higher fuel efficiency, which allow it to travel a greater distance compared to a landfill."},{"question":"Article: When Fox News host Laura Ingraham taunted a Parkland shooting survivor in a Wednesday- ­morning tweet about his college applications being rejected, Twitter users hit back where it hurt most: among her advertisers. David Hogg, the 17-year-old high school senior who has become a gun-control activist, mustered the collective power of social media — and his more than 630,000 Twitter followers — and urged them to “tweet away” at her top sponsors to call on them to boycott her TV show, “The Ingraham Angle.” Soooo @IngrahamAngle what are your biggest advertisers ... Asking for a friend. #BoycottIngramAdverts — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) March 29, 2018 Within 24 hours, several companies responded — among them the pet food brand Nutrish and the home goods retailer Wayfair — announcing over Twitter and in media interviews that they would pull their ads from Ingraham’s show. By Thursday afternoon, Ingraham apologized. “On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,” she tweeted. Any student should be proud of a 4.2 GPA —incl. @DavidHogg111.

As always, he’s welcome to return to the show anytime for a productive discussion. WATCH: https://t.co/5wcd00wWpd (2/2) — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 29, 2018 In the era of boycotts as a byproduct of outrage, with figures such as President Trump threatening the NFL over player protests and airline customers employing the tactic to force change, Hogg’s push for Ingraham’s advertisers to respond to her comments worked remarkably quickly. The swift results showcase the power that the Parkland survivors have, not just in organizing rallies but in spurring corporate America to act. Brands, too, have become quicker to distance themselves from controversy, whether by denouncing white supremacy after neo-Nazis praise their products or by pulling their sponsorship after another Fox News personality, Bill O’Reilly, was accused of sexual harassment. Since the 2016 election, calls to boycott retailers have become frequent: The #GrabYourWallet campaign began as a way to protest Trump, and it identified companies that carried merchandise bearing the Trump name. Those calls have been met with equally passionate responses by Trump supporters who say they are determined to use their buying power to stand with the president and his family. [What happens when neo-Nazis hijack your brand] On Thursday, #GrabYourWallet co-founder Shannon Coulter called Ingraham’s mocking of Hogg’s college rejections “really egregious violations of basic human decency.” “Corporate America has a really positive role to play in preventing that kind of targeted harassment,” Coulter said. “It’s not just that one tweet. It’s that [Ingraham is] signaling to her large audience that it’s okay to do that. Particularly when minors are concerned, I think there’s a line that corporations can draw that apparently Laura Ingraham’s parents didn’t draw.” Ingraham, in addition to apologizing, tried to curtail the damage by noting that Hogg had appeared on her show after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14. Hogg said he felt the apology was merely an effort to save her advertisers. “I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I in this fight,” Hogg tweeted. “It’s time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children.” I 100% agree an apology in an effort just to save your advertisers is not enough. I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I️ in this fight. It’s time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children. https://t.co/H0yWs4zMGk — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) March 29, 2018 Ingraham had faced immediate backlash over her original tweet Wednesday from those shocked by her attack on a teenager who had survived the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. Some of them reminded Ingraham, simply, that she was a mother. Hogg’s 14-year-old sister accused the Fox News host of stooping to a “real low” to boost her ratings. The shooting in Florida — one of several school attacks in 2018 — left 17 students and staff members dead, and it galvanized a new generation of activists, including many teenagers from Parkland. Hogg has been one of the most vocal, speaking at the March for Our Lives rally against gun violence in Washington. Since the shooting, the teen has appeared frequently on television and rallied his growing number of Twitter followers to become civically engaged if they are frustrated with the status quo. [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’] In an interview with TMZ on Tuesday, Hogg spoke about receiving rejection letters from California colleges. Hogg, who has a 4.2 GPA and an SAT score of 1270, was accepted to Florida Atlantic University, California Polytechnic State University and California State University at San Marcos, TMZ reported. On Wednesday morning, Ingraham tweeted a story from a conservative news site that described Hogg as a “Gun Rights Provocateur” who had not gained acceptance to four University of California schools. “David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,” Ingraham tweeted. “(Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA…totally predictable given acceptance rates.)” David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.) https://t.co/wflA4hWHXY — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 28, 2018 Hours later, Hogg wondered, on Twitter, who Ingraham’s biggest advertisers were and soon compiled a list of 12 companies that his followers could contact. Before long, Hogg’s tweet was flooded with replies from his supporters, some of whom pasted images of their messages to the companies mentioned. Also responding were people accusing Hogg of “bullying” Ingraham. At least half a dozen companies have responded to the boycott call. “We are in the process of removing our ads from Laura Ingraham’s program,” Nutrish tweeted Thursday morning. TripAdvisor pointed to one of its company values — “We are better together” — in its decision to stop advertising on Ingraham’s show. “We do not . . . condone the inappropriate comments made by this broadcaster,” TripAdvisor said in a statement. “In our view, these statements focused on a high school student cross the line of decency.” Online home goods retailer Wayfair told CNBC that Ingraham’s personal criticism of Hogg was “not consistent with our values.” Nestlé told ThinkProgress it had no plans to buy future ads on the show. Johnson & Johnson, Stitch Fix and Hulu have also joined the boycott. [The extraordinary number of kids who have endured school shootings since Columbine] It was unclear whether any of the brands would change their minds after Ingraham apologized. “We’ve seen corporations years ago pull out from O’Reilly, only to go back and have to pull out again,” said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color Of Change, a nonprofit advocacy group pushing corporations on issues of racial justice. “The question is, if the corporations do go back, what are they sponsoring? They are sponsoring someone who will use the next tragedy to attack the most vulnerable,” Robinson said. “Laura Ingraham would not exist without corporations enabling her to exist on the air.” Ingraham was previously criticized for telling professional basketball players to “shut up and dribble” after Cleveland Cavalier LeBron James criticized Trump in an interview. While Ingraham has been the most recent target of criticism, she is not the only prominent figure who has faced backlash for attacking the high school students. Just days ago, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and his campaign team were sharply criticized for posting a meme on Facebook about Emma González, another Parkland student and activist. The meme was decried as attacking González’s Cuban heritage. And CNN contributor and former U.S. senator Rick Santorum had to backtrack after saying students would be better off learning CPR than demonstrating for tighter gun laws.

Wayfair, an e-commerce company, said in a statement that it supports “open dialogue and debate on issues,” but that it would stop advertising on Ms. Ingraham’s show. “The decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values,” the company said. Nestle said it had “no plans to buy ads on the show in the future,” while Stitch Fix, a clothing box subscription service, said it had pulled its advertisements. Johnson & Johnson said it had done so as well, while Hulu said on Twitter, “We are no longer advertising on Laura Ingraham’s show and are monitoring all of our ad placements carefully.” Expedia said it had “recently pulled the advertising” from Ms. Ingraham’s show, but it did not elaborate on timing or whether the decision was related to her comments. Consumers have increasingly used social media to demand that advertisers respond to a series of controversies, particularly those involving Fox News hosts. Last year, more than 50 brands pulled ads from “The O’Reilly Factor” after The New York Times reported on settlements that the show’s host, Bill O’Reilly, had made with women who accused him of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior, which contributed to his ouster. ||||| Stitch Fix is the latest advertiser to pull support from Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s show. The online personal shopping service confirmed to The Hill that it would be pulling its ads from Ingraham’s show. HuffPost first reported the development.

I find that I am not attracted to the pretty boy, who loves himself, I go for the more reserved and shy people that I know will treat me right. One time there was this guy back at school who I knew was all over the girls and that didn't want a relationship. He was rude to the teachers and a bit of a bad boy and all the girls swooned over him. I on the other hand was not, at one point he managed to get my number and was texting me. We spoke for a bit but once he started asking me for pictures of myself I stopped the contact, I knew he wasn't to be trusted from the beginning and decided he wasn't right for me. Then it was quite funny how one day we had a class where the rooms were next to each other and in between was a printer that both classes shared. I went to the room to print my work, and he was there waiting also. He asked me for a hug and just raised an eyebrow, then I saw my work had printed so I lent over to grab it and he thought I was going in for the hug.

Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Air was invigorating\\" correctly answer the question \\"What caused the kings of Spain to begin to visit Madrid\\"? Choose your answer from: 1). no; 2). yes;","response":"2). yes; The other answer, 1). no, is wrong because the paragraph states that the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid because \\"the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent.\\" So, the air being invigorating was one of the reasons they started visiting Madrid."},{"question":"Answer the following question: If I tell you that Nectar is used for attracting birds to flowering plants, and ask you the question \\"what is used to attract birds to flowering plants?\\", is the correct answer \\"cellulose\\"?

Step by step answer:","response":"Step 1: Identify the key components in the premise and hypothesis. Premise: White player, attempts, get ball, black player, basketball court. Hypothesis: White player, get ball, black player, playing ground. Step 2: Compare the key components. White player, black player, and get ball are present in both the premise and hypothesis. However, there are differences in 'attempts' vs 'get' and 'basketball court' vs 'playing ground.' Step 3: Analyze the differences. The first difference is the presence of 'attempts' in the premise, indicating an effort or a try, while the hypothesis states 'get ball' as a fact, implying that the action has been completed. This difference raises uncertainty about whether the white player actually got the ball in the end. The second difference is the location: 'basketball court' compared to 'playing ground.' A basketball court is a specific type of playing ground, so this implies that the hypothesis is broader in its description. This difference, however, doesn't affect the entailment as much as the first one. Step 4: Conclusion. Given the differences between the premise and the hypothesis, particularly the uncertainty related to the outcome of the white player's attempt, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise with absolute certainty. However, there is a clear connection between the two statements, and if we had more information about the success or failure of the white player's attempt, we could be more confident in our answer."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history.

It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus .

Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River . The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the... - Ariana, the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \\"Ar(e)ian\\" (inhabitants: \\"\\"; \\"Ar(e)ianoi\\"), was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of the ancient period for a district of wide extent between Central Asia and the Indus River, comprehending the eastern provinces of the Achaemenid Empire that covered the whole country of modern day Afghanistan, and a few parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. - Gwadar Bay is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran. The name is from Persian, \\"Khalij-e Gavader\\" or \\"Gulf of Gwadar\\" on the Arabian Sea. It is an inlet of the Arabian Sea indenting the sandy Makran coast at the IranPakistan border. It is about long and wide. The Dashtiari River flows into it from the northwest, and the Dasht River from the northeast. The town of Gwadar, which has no sewerage system nor protection from the Bay, lies on the Arabian Sea coast about to the east of Gwadar Bay. - Arghandab is a river in Afghanistan, about in length. It rises in the Hazarajat country north-west of Ghazni, and flows south-west falls into the Helmand below Girishk. In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it. The Tarnak is dammed for irrigation at intervals, and in the hot season almost dries up. - The Indus River, also called Darya-e-Sindh or Sindh River or Absn, is a major south-flowing river in South Asia.

High-speed cameras have revealed how cats can manage to land safely even when falling from a great height. Cats have long been renowned for their ability to land on their feet, and now a new documentary will show exactly how the pets manage to hold onto their nine lives as they twist and turn on their way to the ground. Images filmed on a high-speed camera show how a cat's body will perform four manoeuvres in mid-air, including stretching out their legs to transform their bodies into a living parachute. Safety: Images filmed on a high-speed camera show how a cat's body performs four manoeuvres in mid-air, including stretching out their legs to transform their bodies into a living parachute. As part of new ITV documentary The Secret Life of Cats, the animals were filmed in a studio as they were dropped from a height of around 10ft. Slowed down, the footage shows how a. cat will first straighten up so its body will eventually be parallel to. the ground, turning on its head and then its tail. It will then spread all four limbs to slow its fall and as it nears the ground, the cat will extend its claws to give it a good grip when it lands. Finally the tumbling animal will flex its back to minimise any shock from landing. Sir Patrick Bateson, emeritus professor of ethology at Cambridge University and president. of the Zoological Society of London, said that a cat's legs give the. animal air resistance which enables its body to spin around faster. 'They. stick out their legs so that provides greater inertia, so that when. they turn the body the bits that are sticking out don’t turn so. rapidly,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'Then they repeat that with the other set of legs.' Instinct: By the time a kitten is seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to survive a fall, known as the 'righting reflex' According. to the documentary, which airs tomorrow night, by the time a kitten is. seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to. survive a fall, known as the 'righting reflex'. Sir Patrick said that one of his cats, Nelly, had fallen behind a wardrobe when she was a kitten, breaking her pelvis because the space behind the cupboard was too small for her to fully turn. 'She is fine now, but it was a clear demonstration of how if you prevent the animal turning and sticking its legs out, it cannot do the whole operation,' he said. In 2012 it was reported that a one-year-old cat called Sugar had fallen 200ft from a nineteen storey window in Boston, USA, with just a bruised chest. And a 1987 study of 132 cats taken to a vet in New York after falling from high-rise buildings revealed that 90 percent of them survived and one 37 percent required emergency treatment to save their lives. One animal which fell 32 storeys survived with a chipped tooth and a collapsed lung, and was allowed to go home after just 48 hours. Using new filming techniques to show cats as many of their owners will never have seen them before, the documentary also reveals remarkable stories including how one cat saved a couple from a gas explosion and the surprising relationship between a blind Labrador and the feline friend who acts as his guide. One cat who features in the show is Basil, who turned up on Sue Roff’s doorstep unexpectedly 16 years ago. Remarkable tails: The documentary also reveals remarkable stories including how one cat saved a couple from a gas explosion and the surprising relationship between a blind Labrador and the feline friend who acts as his guide. Basil’s acute sense of smell prevented a potentially fatal accident for Sue and her husband one night in 2011. 'I’d done dinner, my husband had gone up to bed. I’d cleaned the cooker and then went up to bed,' said Mrs Roff. However, she had accidentally left one of the gas rings on and asleep upstairs, neither she nor her husband could smell the leaking gas. The pilot light on Sue’s central heating was due to switch on soon, and that would ignite the gas. But as cats have a sense of smell 30 times better than that of a human, to Basil the smell of gas was intense and dangerous. 'At about 1.30am he came on the bed, patted my face and I pushed him away,' said Mrs Roff. 'An hour and a half later he came back, he was much more insistent. He came back and patted my face with one little claw. Then I knew there was something wrong. I could smell something unpleasant; it literally filled the whole house. He could have literally just walked out the cat flap outside, but he didn’t. If he hadn’t have woken me up, it would have just gone kaboom. I’m really proud of him, he is my hero.' The programme also tells the surprising story of the relationship between a blind dog, 14-year-old Labrador Terfel, and his best friend, a cat called Pwditat. Terfel had been thrown against a wall as a puppy, causing his blindness, but Pwditat has been able to act as his guide cat. 'Terfel is much more confident when Pwditat is around,' said owner Ann Cragg. 'He relies on him to avoid bumping into things. Often when they’re out, they’re nose to tail. Pwditat in the lead and Terfel following him.' Secret Life of Cats will be broadcast on ITV at 9pm on Monday June 2.

Passage: Honda first adopted the Si badge for the Japanese domestic market (JDM) third-generation Civic in November 1984. Mainly offered in hatchback form, the main aesthetic difference for the Si was a slight bulge in the hood, which accommodated the taller DOHC engine. A four-door sedan variant also existed in Japan, but was only produced in small numbers and is rare. Designated as ZC1 in Japan and D16A1 in Europe, the new engine put out 118 hp (88 kW), enabling the car to hit 122 mph (196 km / h) and go from 0 -- 60 mph in 8.9 seconds. Since compact cars at the time typically made less than 100 hp (75 kW), the Si proved popular amongst enthusiasts. In 1986, the Si trim was extended to the Civic hatchback, offering the same powertrain of the CRX Si but with four-seats. Added improvements for the Civic Si hatchback included a removable glass sunroof, a five-speed manual gearbox, tilt steering wheel, a full-width taillight panel, a color-keyed front airdam, sedan-style disk wheel covers, and a roof spoiler. Like the CRX Si, the Si hatchback was powered by a 91 hp (68 kW), 12-valve SOHC engine designated EW4 / D15A4 (the latter code was used for the 1987 model year but with the same specs). The Civic Si also saw a release in New Zealand and Australia in 1987, sharing specifications similar to those of the American-market Si.

Isolate the term containing the variable t on one side of the equation. 2. Simplify the equation by performing inverse arithmetic operations. Let's start solving: Given equation: -67*t - 410 = -812 Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable t To do this, we want to get rid of -410 from the left side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding 410 to both sides of the equation. Remember, we can do any operation on an equation as long as we do the same thing to both sides. -67*t - 410 + 410 = -812 + 410 After simplification: -67*t = -402 Step 2: Simplify the equation by performing inverse arithmetic operations Now, to isolate t, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -67, which is the coefficient of the t term. (-67*t) / -67 = -402 / -67 After simplification, we get: t = 6 So, the solution for the given equation -67*t - 410 = -812 is t = 6."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What word became a derogatory term by 1915? is inside the article: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term.

In a “mad race” to reach the UK, Abdul Rahman Haroun, 40, was arrested by British police just steps away from the mouth of the Eurotunnel in Folkestone, Kent. This is the first incident of a migrant successfully managing to walk the length of the Channel Tunnel where he is believed to have dodged trains travelling at up to 160kph. It is unclear how Rahman Haroun managed to scale four high fortified fences, evade security patrols, dogs and 400 CCTV cameras inside the Eurotunnel site on the French side. He is thought to have walked all day in almost complete darkness. He is now facing prison and is unlikely to be able to request asylum. An alert was sounded at 7.30am on Tuesday after around 500 migrants attempted 600 times to get into the Eurotunnel terminal overnight. An alarm went off in the southern tunnel at ‘interval 5’ in Calais signalling an “anomaly” and traffic was suspended in the 17km stretch of track while police searched the tunnel area, sparking up to two-hour delays for Shuttle passengers coming to France from the Folkestone end. Kent Police have confirmed that officers are investigating the incident after Rahman Haroun was located in the Channel Tunnel near to its exit at the Folkestone Terminal at 6.13pm on August 4. When the alert was called in the morning, tunnel security attempted to track down the migrant who - according to local newspaper Nord Littoral - had embarked on a “mad race at the risk of his life in almost pitch black with trains travelling at 130kph or even 160kph for the Eurostar”. A test train was sent into the tunnel on the French side with agents and an “intense search” was launched to try and spot the illegal intruder. However, it was ten hours later that British police intercepted the migrant “a few steps” from the Folkestone entrance. He has been charged with causing an obstruction to a train using the railway under the Malicious Damage Act 1861 and is due to appear before Medway Magistrates’ Court on August 6. Eurotunnel has filed a legal complaint in Britain over the incident and officers from Home Office Immigration Enforcement are also investigating. “This type of criminal intrusion in the tunnel is a very rare event and is both illegal and extremely dangerous,” a Eurotunnel spokesman told Nord Littoral. Eurotunnel said that it hoped that “the force of law will be used and justice done” so that this attempt does not set a precedent for other migrants to try and do the same. “Not only did he run a significant risk of being seriously injured or killed, but he has also lost all possibilities to request asylum or find work in England,” a spokesman said. This is the first time a migrant has managed to walk the entire distance. The last attempt was in June 2012, when a migrant managed to get into the same southern tunnel stretch but got stuck in a technical storeroom and was later arrested. Another spent several hours wandering in the Channel Tunnel in March 2010, sparking major disruptions to trains. He was later sentenced to a two-month prison term. On Saturday night, an organised group of around 200 migrants tried to storm into the Channel Tunnel in the early hours, saying they intended to walk to the UK, tearing down fences and charging past police with tear gas, chanting: “Open the borders!’”. On Tuesday night, police said that there were 350 fresh intrusions into the Eurotunnel site despite heavy security and 400 migrants around the 650-hectare zone. ||||| The United Nations said dire living conditions for refugees and migrants living in the French port city of Calais, delays in processing asylum applications and the rising number of people dying while trying to reach Britain constitutes a “civil emergency” that won’t slow down for the foreseeable future. Speaking from Geneva on Friday, Vincent Cochetel, director for Europe at the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said the U.N. has been calling for an “urgent, comprehensive and sustainable response” by Europe, and particularly France, to the crisis for the past year, The Local France reports. \\"Let's treat that as a civil emergency,\\" Cochetel said, referring to the situation in Calais. An estimated 3,000 people are living in a Calais camp known as “The Jungle,” while thousands have attempted to enter the Channel Tunnel in recent weeks, which runs underneath the English Channel and connects the U.K. and continental Europe. Ten people have died in the process since the beginning of June, according to UNHCR. The European Union agreed earlier this week to give 78 million to the U.K. and France to help both countries deal with the crisis. Women and children in Calais are vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking and require particular attention from the French authorities for their protection, said Melissa Fleming, UNHCR spokeswoman, said from Geneva on Friday. \\"We need a comprehensive package, and we need a sustainable response,\\" said Cochetel. \\"We have had that problem for 14 years.… You don't change geography. This will continue.\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron came under fire last week from NGOs and opposition lawmakers for referring to the Calais migrants as “swarms of people.” Germany received 73,120 asylum applications in the first three months of 2015, approximately 10 times the number of people who applied for asylum in the U.K. during the same time period, the U.K.’s Channel 4 reports. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Many living in Calais are refugees from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Syria, but “not all the people gathering in Calais may be refugees,” Fleming said. “Solutions for these other groups may include humane and dignified return to their countries of origin or other countries where they have lived before, in cooperation with the countries of origin and in accordance with international human rights standards,” she said. Cochetel recently returned from a visit to some of the Greek islands, including Lesvos and Kos, where more than 124,000 refugees and migrants have arrived by sea this year. There is “total chaos” in Greece, said Cochetel. The conditions in the country’s overcrowded and unsanitary reception centers were the subject of a damning Amnesty International report released earlier this year. There has been a “staggering” 750 percent increase in the number of arrivals to Greece this year compared to the same period in 2014 and 50,000 arrived in July 2015 alone, 20,000 more than the previous month, said UNHCR. The “vast majority” of those arriving in Greece are refugees fleeing from conflict zones or countries that practice human rights violations, according the UNHCR. Syrians fleeing their country’s civil war, which entered its fifth year in March, made up 63 percent of 2015 arrivals to Greece and 70 percent of those who arrived in July 2015 alone. “Many are in need of urgent medical assistance, water, food, shelter and information. All are exhausted. The reception infrastructure, services and registration procedures are falling far short of real needs,” the U.N. said in a statement Friday. \\"Such a level of suffering should and can be avoided. The Greek authorities need to urgently designate a single body to coordinate response and set up an adequate humanitarian assistance mechanism,” said Cochetel. “As Greece faces financial challenges the country needs help, European countries should support Greece on these efforts.\\" Greece is typically the first stop for arrivals before they leave on a journey to other parts of Europe. Cochetel said Greece needs to improve access to its asylum procedure—just 6,200 people applied for asylum by the end of June, a tiny percentage of the overall number of arrivals. The capacity of reception centers on mainland Greece also needs to be increased as up to 450 people, mainly families with young children, are sleeping in the Pedion Tou Areos Park in Athens nightly. More than 225,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean by boat in an attempt to reach Europe this year, compared with 200,000 last year. More than 2,000 have died or gone missing in the process this year alone. This week, 25 bodies were recovered after a boat carrying an estimated 700 people capsized off the coast of Libya on Wednesday. Around 400 people were rescued, UNHCR reported. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"A man from Africa named Abdul Rahman Haroun tried to go from Calais to England by walking almost 30 miles underground through a tunnel called the Channel Tunnel.

UPDATED:. 07:20 EST, 18 October 2013. As the old stereotype goes, German people are always first to bag the sun loungers, and always last to say thank you. The Goethe Institute, which is Germany's. equivalent of The British Council, claims that a number of factors could explain away the. stereotype. Famed for their punctuality, they also have a reputation for getting straight to the point - which can be perceived as rude by the British. Scroll down for video. Germans are stereotypically thought of as the first with their towels on the sunloungers (posed by models) The explanation is that the country's centuries old divisions may make some feel like they are 'surrounded by enemies'. Because of the nation's fractured past, Germans hold stability, structure and order in high regard. The Goethe Institute have produced a video which explain the misconceptions - and how Germans differ from people of different nationalities. In the clip, a German man is seen standing upright and to attention with a handful of documents while the foreigner - possibly British - sits in a slouched position. Christine Jansen of the Amsterdam branch of the Goethe Institute told website The Local: 'We produced the films as a starting point of a discussion about cultural differences when doing business with Germans.' She added: 'The video-makers attribute Germans' tendency to avoid personal matters in favour of getting straight to the point to history. 'They say the historic division of Germany into several smaller states meant Germans were constantly surrounded by enemies and they kept themselves to themselves.' But Jansen told The Local that the mention of Germany being surrounded by enemies was not a reference to the Second World War and that there had been some criticism of that part of the video.","response":"This article talks about how German people have some stereotypes, like being the first to put their towels on sun loungers and the last to say thank you.

The tragedy happened around 3 a.m. Why was a 14-year-old boy out that late without his mother, Shanise Farrar, who called the shooting an assassination? Or his aunt, Quwana Barcene, who said the bloody gun police say was found near his body was part of a coverup? Where was the supervising adult who should have been with a 14-year-old boy walking the streets of New York at 3 o'clock in the morning? \\"I'm not saying that he's the best one, but he's my angel,\\" his grieving mother said. Her \\"angel\\" was a suspected gang member who police say was chasing and shooting at an unidentified man when they encountered him. Her \\"angel\\" was arrested last month for attempted murder of a 15-year-old. Her \\"angel\\" left their apartment around 8 p.m. and she had no idea where he was until the next morning when detectives informed her that her son was dead. I want to mourn for her loss, I really do. But as callous and as heartless as this sounds, I just can't get past what awful parents she and the boy's father were. Children may be born angels, but with all the temptations out there in the world, it takes work to try to keep them that way. I'm sure the three teenagers suspected in the death of 23-year-old Christopher Lane -- killed because they allegedly were bored -- started off as angels. But who, besides their parents, would call them angels now? \\"I know my son. He's a good kid,\\" said Jennifer Luna, the mother of the boy prosecutor Jason Hicks said pulled the trigger. As a newspaper reporter, I covered and was around a fair number of crime scenes involving juvenile delinquents and few things bothered me more than listening to their parents. Crying, ranting, proclaiming how great their children were despite being kicked out of school or previous run-ins with the law. That's not to say kids won't be kids. Of course they will be. Which is why it is vitally important that parents be parents. So when kids get bored, they don't think they should go \\"f**k with some n**gers,\\" as then-18-year-old Deryl Dedmon Jr. suggested before he and his buddies ran over and killed 49-year-old auto worker James Craig Anderson, the first black person he saw, with his pickup truck back in 2011. Or randomly shoot a college student jogging down the street as entertainment -- though it seems the shooting may not have been as random as previously thought considering one of the suspects, who is black, tweeted that he hated white people back in April. Parents are supposed to instill a sense of right and wrong in their children and then keep up the due diligence necessary to make sure they don't veer off that path. When parents don't do that, we end up with three 15-year-olds assaulting and breaking the arm of a 13-year-old on a school bus in Florida. \\"This is life. I am sorry what happened to the victim,\\" Julian McKnight Sr., whose son Julian was one of the boys accused in the attack, said after a court appearance. A second appearance is scheduled later this month. \\"It's just the way it is. My son ain't never been no bad person, he just got mixed with bad people, that's all ... he sorry.\\" I am not a perfect parent with all the answers. But I do know that it was the father, and not the son, who was apologizing -- and that, my friends, is our problem in a nutshell. We don't teach accountability, we don't expect accountability and I'm not even sure we even know what accountability looks like anymore. Some of us have become so addicted to pointing fingers at others for all the wrong that happens in our lives that self-assessment has become synonymous with blaming the victim. Yes, there are cultural factors that make parenting difficult. And sometimes a bad seed is just that. But none of this excuses us from taking personal responsibility where we can. I am tired of seeing \\"sorry\\" being used to cloak negligent parents. Sorry won't bring back Christopher Lane or James Craig Anderson. And they, too, were each somebody's \\"angel.\\" If sorry is not good enough to protect a bartender who serves alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person who drives and kills someone, why is sorry good enough for parents who, through negligence, are culpable for the crimes their undisciplined children commit? If my son goes out and breaks the neighbor's window, I have to pay for it. Why is a window more sacred than another human life? We need to hold parents more accountable, both culturally and legally, for the actions of their children. Maybe then more parents will be more engaged in the lives of their children on the front end, rather than the back end, in front of a judge. Society has avenues for juveniles who refuse to obey their parents. But where are the safeguards for society when parents decide not to use those avenues? I'm tired of hearing how good the kids who commit heinous crimes are. Maybe we should start putting parents on the witness stand so they can tell us exactly what they did to raise such perfect children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","response":"1.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Douras (1857-1935), a lawyer and judge in New York City; and Rose Reilly (1867-1928). Her father performed the civil marriage of Gloria Gould Bishop. She had three older sisters, Ethel, Rose, and Reine. An older brother, Charles, drowned at the age of 15 in 1906. Publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst and Davies lived as a couple for decades but were never married, as Hearst's wife refused to give him a divorce. At one point, he reportedly came close to marrying Davies, but decided his wife's settlement demands were too high. Hearst was extremely jealous and possessive of her, even though he was married throughout their relationship. Lita Grey, the second wife of Charlie Chaplin, wrote four decades later that Davies confided with her about the relationship with Hearst. Grey quoted Davies saying: God, I'd give everything I have to marry that silly old man. Not for the money and security--he's given me more than I'll ever need. Not because he's such cozy company, either. Most times, when he starts jawing, he bores me stiff. And certainly not because he's so wonderful behind the barn. Why, I could find a million better lays any Wednesday. No, you know what he gives me, sugar? He gives me the feeling I'm worth something to him. A whole lot of what we have, or don't have, I don't like. He's got a wife who'll never give him a divorce. She knows about me, but it's still understood that when she decides to go to the ranch for a week or a weekend, I've got to vamoose. And he snores, and he can be petty, and has sons about as old as me. But he's kind and he's good to me, and I'd never walk out on him. By the late 1930s, Hearst was suffering financial reversals. After selling many of the contents of St Donat's Castle, Davies sold her jewelry, stocks and bonds and wrote a check for 1 million to Hearst to save him from bankruptcy. Davies had developed a drinking problem over the course of many years, but her alcoholism grew worse in the latter 1930's and the 1940's, as she and Hearst lived an increasingly isolated life. The two spent most of the Second World War at Hearst's Northern California estate of Wyntoon, until returning to San Simeon in 1945. Hearst died on August 14, 1951. In his will, Hearst provided handsomely for Davies, leaving her 170,000 shares of Hearst Corporation stock, in addition to 30,000 he had established for her in a trust fund in 1950. This gave her a controlling interest in the company for a short-time, until she chose to relinquish the stock voluntarily to the corporation on October 30th 1951. She retained her original 30,000 shares and an advisory role with the corporation. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","response":"Marion Davies was a famous woman who lived a long time ago.

Sophia entered the front_yard. The green_pepper is in the red_bottle. Sophia exited the front_yard. Isabella moved the green_pepper to the blue_bathtub. Isabella exited the front_yard. Sophia entered the front_yard. Where will Sophia look for the green_pepper? Output:","response":"red_bottle Explanation: To come up with the answer, I identified the key events and the individual's beliefs in the story. Initially, the green_pepper is in the red_bottle. When Sophia last saw it, that was its location. She left the front_yard and didn't observe Isabella moving the green_pepper to the blue_bathtub. Therefore, when Sophia reenters the front_yard and looks for the green_pepper, she will look in the red_bottle because that's where she last saw it and is unaware of the relocation. This scenario falls under the category of individual's belief not matching reality."},{"question":"Q:Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: The factory made all sorts of specialized toys; AK47's, MiGs, anything having to do with what? Options: - free trade zones - russia - industrial park - napoleon - workers A:","response":"The factory in question made all sorts of specialized toys, including AK47's and MiGs. Given the list of options provided, it is reasonable to conclude that these toys primarily relate to \\"Russia.\\" AK47 is a well-known Russian automatic rifle, and MiG is a series of Russian jet fighters. These weapons are iconic symbols of Russian military prowess and technology. Free trade zones and industrial parks are not specifically connected to the theme of these specialized toys, nor are they unique to Russia. These zones provide a more general context for manufacturing and industry, whereas the subject matter of the toys serves as a clear indicator of their relation to Russia. Napoleon, although a historical figure who fought against Russia in the 19th century, does not have an apparent connection to AK47's and MiGs. These toys do not reflect any aspect of Napoleon's era because their designs and technologies are from the 20th century. Workers, as well, do not provide a clear connection to the specialized toys mentioned. While workers are involved in the manufacturing process of these toys, it is the theme of the toys themselves, namely Russian military weaponry, that helps us answer the question. Hence, given the options presented, it is in line with common sense that the specialized toys featured in the factory are related to \\"Russia.\\""},{"question":"Write an article with the title: \\"'I Love Lucy' actress Shirley Mitchell dies at 94\\"","response":"Title: \\"I Love Lucy\\" Actress Shirley Mitchell Passes Away at 94 Hi, sweetie!

She was an actress who played a character on a funny television show called \\"I Love Lucy.\\" This show was very popular a long time ago, even before your mommy and daddy were born. Shirley Mitchell was very special because she lived for 94 years! That's a very long time, almost like being a great-grandma. Most people don't live that long, but she did because she took good care of herself and was very strong. Sadly, she recently passed away. That means she isn't with us anymore.

Finnish:","response":"Euroopan unionilla on valinnanvaraa siinä, miten se reagoi tapahtumiin sen ympäristössä: se voi vain tehdä lausunnon tai ottaa aktiivisesti osaa tämän konfliktin rauhanomaiseen ratkaisemiseen. Euroopan unioni (EU) on ainutlaatuinen poliittinen ja taloudellinen liitto, joka koostuu 27 jäsenvaltiosta. Se tarjoaa jäsenilleen monenlaisia etuja, kuten yhteisen valuutan, vapaan liikkuvuuden ja yhteiset politiikat, ja sen on toimittava yhtenäisesti ratkaistessaan erilaisia kysymyksiä ja haasteita. Yksi EU:n vahvuuksista on sen yhteinen ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikka, jonka tarkoituksena on ylläpitää rauhaa, ehkäistä konflikteja ja vahvistaa kansainvälistä turvallisuutta. Tämä politiikka sisältää diplomaattisia toimia, talouspakotteita ja kriisinhallintaoperaatioita. Kun EU kohtaa tilanteen, joka vaikuttaa Euroopan turvallisuuteen tai vakauden, se voi valita useista eri toimintatavoista. Yksi mahdollinen reaktio voi olla julkisen lausunnon antaminen, jossa ilmaistaan EU:n kanta kyseisen konfliktin tai kriisin osalta. Tämän tyyppinen reaktio on usein ensimmäinen askel ja voi olla tehokas tapa osoittaa tukea tai vastustusta tietyille toimille tai ratkaisuille. Toinen vaihtoehto on, että EU voi ryhtyä aktiivisesti toimiin konfliktin rauhanomaisen ratkaisemisen edistämiseksi. Tämä voi sisältää neuvottelujen järjestämistä konfliktin osapuolten kesken, taloudellista tukea rauhanprosesseille, humanitaarista apua tai avustusta jälleenrakennukseen. EU voi myös ottaa käyttöön erilaisia turvallisuus- ja puolustuspolitiikan välineitä, kuten siviilikriisinhallintaoperaatioita tai sotilaallisia operaatioita konfliktialueen vakauttamiseksi. Tärkeää on, että Euroopan unionin reaktio kriiseihin ja konflikteihin perustuu yhteiseen päätöksentekoon ja jäsenvaltioiden yhteisten etujen ja arvojen mukaiseen toimintaan. EU:n pitkäaikaisena tavoitteena on oltava luoda entistä tiiviimpiä yhteyksiä ja yhteistyötä naapurialueillaan, jotta koko Euroopan alueen vakautta, turvallisuutta ja hyvinvointia voidaan edistää."},{"question":"Please answer this question: Which philosopher was a tutor to Alexander the Great?","response":"The philosopher who was a tutor to Alexander the Great was named Aristotle.

Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920.

The all-white Migaloo who shares his distinguishable albino appearance with just one other white whale in the world, a Norwegian, was sighted for the first time this year by a member of the public just off the coast of Green Cape in southern NSW on Tuesday. He was then spotted several times again on Thursday, with camera crews getting magnificent views of the 35-year-old off the coast of Sydney. He was snapped and filmed breaching in waters off Botany Bay, Cronulla and Bondi as Australia's much-loved white whale continued his three-month migratory trip from Antarctica to North Queensland and back. Scroll down for video Photographer Jonas Liebschner shot this stunning picture of Migaloo as he surfaced near the boat of Whale Watching Sydney at Cronulla in Sydney's south on Thursday afternoon Migaloo was swimming in a 'competition pod' with four other Humpback whales as they tried to jostle one another for the leading position while heading north through Sydney It is the 23rd consecutive year Migaloo has been spotted on the eastern seaboard, his first being in 1991 when he was sighted by marine biologist Dan Burns off the coast off Byron Bay. By Friday he will have made his way north of Newcastle, before reaching Queensland at the end of the month. He is being joined by others from the Australian East Coast Humpback whale population, leaving the cool waters of the Antarctic behind in search of Queensland's tropical warm paradise. Photographer Jonas Liebschner was on scene to snap Migaloo during his first movements through Sydney. Mr Leibschner was tipped off by whale station volunteers at Botany Bay that Migaloo and a pod of other humpbacks were swimming a few hundred metres off shore in what's known as a 'competition pod.' 'They try to swim as fast as they can and jostle for the dominant position, zig-zagging underwater,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Usually restricted to a minimum of 150 metres from Migaloo, Mr Liebschner and his team from Whale Watching Sydney got closer than they anticipated because of the pods erratic underwater behaviour. He said his crew were forced to the boat's engine off and idle near the whales which surfaced closer to the boat than expected. Migaloo, just one of two white humpback whales in the world, breaches in the foreground with a stunning afternoon backdrop of Sydney's CBD behind him Mr Liebschner was on Migaloo watch on Thursday, first heading to Bondi at 6.30am, before receiving a call from a whale station at Botany Bay to inform he and his whale watching team that Migaloo was further south Migaloo is only part way into his three month winter journey from Antarctica to North Queensland in search of warmer water The best places to catch Migaloo this week will be Newcastle and Nelson Bay, north of Sydney on Friday, before makes his journey north to Cape Byron where he was first spotted by a marine biologist 23 years ago Australian laws exist whereby planes and sea craft are prohibited from entering a certain zone when photographing or filming Migaloo. Founder of the White Whale Research Centre Oskar Peterson, who has been tracking the albino's movements since he was first spotted in the early 90s, told Daily Mail Australia why. Mr Peterson, who also runs a blog dedicated purely to the 'fascinating' sea creature, said Migaloo survived a run-in with a trimaran or outrigger boat which left him with significant black scarring on his lower back. The close shave meant tougher laws were brought in to protect the rare animal who has a life expectancy of 80. 'Planes have to stay at least 2000 feet from him and 500 feet if you are travelling in a boat,' Mr Peterson said. Oskar Peterson excitedly tweeted to his followers about Migaloo's first Australian sighting for the 2104 migratory season Cronulla, Botany Bay and Bondi were some of the areas around Sydney where Migaloo was spotted on Thursday Members of the public were more than interested in getting a glimpse of the famous white whale Mr Peterson also took to twitter on Thursday afternoon to spread the good news that Migaloo was in Sydney. 'Attention Sydney whale watchers. Migaloo was just sighted off Cronulla 30 minutes ago, heading north towards Bondi, enjoy!' The researcher runs his pet, not-for-profit blog full of facts, photos and other tidbits about Australia's much-loved sea creature. The site, migaloo.com.au, is used predominantly as an education tool for school children. 'I've had quite a lot of money offered for the website, but I use it as an educational site mainly for school kids who send me plenty of emails at this time of year.' ||||| Famous albino whale is with at least four other whales as part of seasonal migration of humpbacks to warmer waters Migaloo the great white whale has been spotted making his way up the east coast of Australia. The famous albino whale is travelling with at least four other whales as part of the seasonal migration of humpbacks to warmer waters The white humpback, first noticed in 1991, was sighted off the coast of Eden on Wednesday, and then Cronulla, south of Sydney, on Thursday afternoon. A Port Stephens-based Twitter account reported a sighting on Friday morning. He is travelling with at least four other whales as part of the seasonal migration of humpbacks to warmer waters. Although Migaloo’s rough itinerary can be figured out, it is still a lucky whale watcher who spots him, Oskar Peterson, from the White Whale Research Centre, told Guardian Australia. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Although Migaloo’s rough itinerary can be figured out, it is still a lucky whale watcher who spots him. Photograph: whalewatchingsydney.com.au “There were a couple of years after 1991 when we didn’t see him at all, and there’s been a couple of years when he goes missing in action,” said Peterson. “He glows, you can’t really miss him when you do see him out there from a distance, and it’s like fluorescent blue when you see him up close.” Migaloo, whose name is an Aboriginal word for “white fella”, was the only known white whale in the world until 2011 when an all-white calf was filmed. It is not known how old he is, but Peterson said he has had reports of the birth of a white whale in 1988, which could have been Migaloo. Humpback whales can live to about 80 years of age. “He’s going to be around for a few generations,” Peterson said. “He’s been a bit of an ambassador for the whale watching tourism.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Migaloo's name is an Aboriginal word for 'white fella'. Photograph: whalewatchingsydney.com.au Whales are frequently spotted off the east coast around this time of year, as the humpback population of about 15,000 migrate to warm waters to breed after spending the summer in Antarctica. While many people take to the water in boats to watch the whale migration, there are strict rules in place to prevent harassment of the animals, including restrictions of up to 300m on how close people can get. Migaloo has “special status” in New South Wales and Queensland. Watchers must stay at least 500m away – 600m for aircraft and jetskis – and there are heavy fines for breaching the laws. Peterson’s organisation, a collaboration of marine biologists from Lismore’s Southern Cross university and a number of other marine professionals, has tracked and aggregated information about Migaloo over the years, hoping to raise awareness about the threats to whale populations and their surrounds. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Migaloo has 'special status' in New South Wales and Queensland. Watchers must stay at least 500m away. Photograph: whalewatchingsydney.com.au “It’s about educating the world population of the dangers and lack of understanding of the marine environment, the Great Barrier Reef in particular,” he said. “Over the years it’s gotten bigger and bigger and people ring up and send emails, and over the year we get a clear picture,” said Peterson. “Then, with the invention of Twitter, it’s gone ballistic.” Peterson said since Migaloo’s sighting off Sydney on Thursday the organisation’s account had gained several hundred new followers overnight, from all over the world. “It’s phenomenal. There’s so much interest in this white whale.” |||||Summary:","response":"Migaloo, a rare albino humpback whale, has been spotted off the coast of New South Wales, Australia, during his annual migration north along Australia's eastern seaboard. There are only two known white humpback whales in the world, making Migaloo an extraordinary sight for those lucky enough to spot him. The first sighting of Migaloo was in 1991, and since then, he has become a beloved figure in Australia. Migaloo's annual migration takes him from the cool waters of Antarctica to the warm, tropical waters of North Queensland and back. He is protected under Australian federal law, with strict regulations in place to ensure that boats and planes maintain a safe distance from him. Migaloo has become a powerful symbol for marine conservation and an ambassador for whale-watching tourism."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Search online and sign up for classes in your area.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"The victim sentainced the defendant to life in prison.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The judge sentainced the defendant to life in prison.\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"Sentence A: \\"The victim sentainced the defendant to life in prison.\\" Sentence B: \\"The judge sentainced the defendant to life in prison.\\" Between these two sentences, Sentence A does not make sense. Here's a detailed explanation for both sentences: Sentence A: The word \\"sentainced\\" is incorrect and should be \\"sentenced.\\" Disregarding the spelling error, this sentence still doesn't make sense because it states that \\"the victim\\" is the one who sentenced \\"the defendant.\\" In a court of law, the person who is authorized and responsible for determining punishments (sentencing) for a person guilty of a crime is a judge, not a victim. A victim is the person affected by the crime and not responsible for any judicial decisions. Sentence B: Again, the word \\"sentainced\\" is incorrect and should be \\"sentenced,\\" but regardless of the spelling error, the sentence does make sense. In this sentence, it says that \\"the judge sentenced the defendant to life in prison.\\" This statement is logical because a judge has the legal authority to pass sentences on defendants who are found guilty of a crime. In this case, the judge decided on a life sentence for the defendant. In summary, Sentence A does not make sense because the victim cannot sentence a defendant, while Sentence B makes sense because a judge has the authority to pass sentences on defendants."},{"question":"from right to left: monk, usurer and physician.

How to forgive a mother after she has passed Write down in detail exactly what it is that you resent about your mother. We have to name it to claim it. We can't just keep saying \\" i resent my mother \\", or \\" i hate my mother \\", or \\" it's all my mother's fault \\".","response":"Forgiving a mother who has passed away can be a long and emotional journey, but it is essential for one's own personal healing and growth. Here are the detailed steps to forgive a mother who has passed: 1. Identify the specific reasons for your resentment. As you mentioned, write down a list of the specific actions, words, or events that have caused resentment towards your mother. It is essential to be honest and specific about your feelings, as it will help you understand your emotions better. 2. Acknowledge your emotions. Now that you have recognized the reasons behind your resentment, allow yourself to feel the emotions that these reasons evoke, whether it's anger, hurt, or sadness. Acknowledging your emotions is essential in the forgiveness process because it helps you process your feelings healthily. 3. Practice empathy. Try to put yourself in your mother's shoes to gain insight into her actions, choices, or words that might have caused resentment. Consider her upbringing, life experiences, and possible constraints that could have influenced her behavior. This empathy exercise is key to understanding and getting closer to forgiveness. 4. Reflect on your role. It is crucial to recognize your contribution to the relationship dynamics. Were there any actions, words, or expectations on your part that might have negatively affected the connection between you and your mother? Understanding your part in the relationship can help you learn and grow from the experience. 5. Acceptance and understanding of your mother's imperfections. No person is flawless, and we all make mistakes. Learn to accept your mother's imperfections as part of who she was and understand that you cannot change the past. The focus should now be on your own healing and growth. 6. Let go of the anger and resentment. It can be challenging, but it is essential to release the anger and resentment you have been holding on to. One way to do this is by practicing mindfulness and meditation, which can guide you in letting go of negative emotions. 7. Find a way to honor your mother's memory. Even though there may be painful memories attached to your mother, try to identify aspects of her life that you can appreciate and honor. You can engage in activities she enjoyed or support a cause she was passionate about as a way of positively remembering her. 8. Seek professional help if necessary. If forgiveness is too challenging or overwhelming, consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling. A professional can give guidance and support during this challenging journey towards forgiveness. 9. Practice self-forgiveness. During this healing process, remember to practice self-forgiveness. Understand that it is okay to feel anger and resentment, but the key is releasing these emotions to move forward. Remind yourself of your worth, value, and the lessons learned from this life experience. 10. Cultivate an ongoing practice of forgiveness and compassion. Forgiveness is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Continue to practice forgiveness and compassion towards yourself, your mother, and others in your life. By doing this, you will allow yourself to heal and grow in emotional intelligence, resilience, and inner peace. In conclusion, forgiving a deceased mother and letting go of resentment is a significant personal journey of healing and growth. It involves understanding her actions, acknowledging your emotions, accepting imperfections, and cultivating empathy, compassion, and forgiveness. By doing so, your heart will open up, and you will find peace within yourself."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type.

Step 1: Analyze Skylar's actions. - Skylar made their own costume for a contest on Halloween night, implying they had an interest in the contest and might be looking forward to participating. Step 2: Consider Skylar's motivations. - Skylar likely made the costume to wear to the contest and potentially win or enjoy the experience. This suggests dedication and enthusiasm towards Halloween and the contest. Step 3: Think about possible next steps for Skylar. - Skylar might want to try on the costume, show it to friends or family, make adjustments if needed, or prepare for the contest in other ways.

Here's a detailed overview of the process: 1. Over 99% of the exocrine pancreas cells produce digestive juices. 2. These cells secrete the digestive juices 'externally' into the small intestine. 3. The digestive juices contain enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. 4. The digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine. 5. In the small intestine, the enzymes break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. 6. As the nutrients are absorbed, blood sugar levels rise due to the increased levels of glucose resulting from the breakdown of carbohydrates. 7. In response to the rise in blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. The final step: Insulin, secreted by the pancreas, helps regulate blood sugar levels by signaling cells in the body to take in glucose from the bloodstream. This process ensures that the body maintains a stable blood sugar level, preventing any potential complications associated with high or low blood glucose levels.

The voice that the audience hears in the opening narration is \\"not her speaking voice, but her mind's voice\\". Ada has not spoken a word since she was six years old and no one, including herself, knows why.

Flora later dramatically tells two women in New Zealand that her mother has not spoken since the death of her husband who died as a result of being struck by lightning.

Ada, Flora, and their belongings, including a hand crafted piano, are deposited on a New Zealand beach by a ship's crew. As there is no one there to meet them, they spend the night alone on the beach amongst their crated belongings.

The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin. Many people eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs. There are nine main categories of muscular dystrophy that contain more than thirty specific types. The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. Other types include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. They are due to mutations in genes that are involved in making muscle proteins. This can occur due to either inheriting the defect from one's parents or the mutation occurring during early development. Disorders may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing. There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells. Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which represents about half of all cases of muscular dystrophy, affects about one in 5,000 males at birth. Muscular dystrophy was first described in the 1830s by Charles Bell. The word \\"dystrophy\\" is from the Greek \\"dys\\", meaning \\"difficult\\" and \\"troph\\" meaning \\"nourish\\". Gene therapy, as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek \`\` muscle '' , \`\` weakness '' , and Latin : gravis \`\` serious '' ; abbreviated MG ) is a neuromuscular disease that leads to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue . In the most common cases , muscle weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions . Alternatively , in a much rarer form , muscle weakness is caused by a genetic defect in some portion of the neuromuscular junction that is inherited at birth as opposed to developing through passive transmission from the mother 's immune system at birth or through autoimmunity later in life . Myasthenia is treated with medications such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy ( surgical removal of the thymus gland ) . The disease is diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million per year . Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness . - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Muscle weakness or myasthenia (my- from Greek meaning \\"muscle\\" + -asthenia meaning \\"weakness\\") is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells. It can be temporary or long-lasting (from seconds or minutes to months or years). - A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a nerve cell (neuron) whose cell body is located in the spinal cord and whose fiber (axon) projects outside the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. Motor neurons' axons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors to produce effects. Types of motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons. - Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis. - Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state. - Weakness or asthenia is a symptom of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. - Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be exchanged to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body. - A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs. - Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Onset can be sudden. Those affected often have a large thymus gland or develop a thymoma. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease which results from antibodies that block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the junction between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia. Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia. Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or nerve conduction studies. Myasthenia gravis is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may improve symptoms in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required. Myasthenia gravis affects 50 to 200 per million people. It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 per million people each year. Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness. It most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60. It is uncommon in children. With treatment most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy. The word is from the Greek \\"muscle\\" and asthenia \\"weakness\\", and the \\"serious\\". - Inflammatory myopathy (inflammatory muscle disease or myositis) is disease featuring weakness and inflammation of muscles and (in some types) muscle pain. The cause of much inflammatory myopathy is unknown (idiopathic), and such cases are classified according to their symptoms and signs and electromyography, MRI and laboratory findings. It can also be associated with underlying cancer. The main classes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). - An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water. The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an electric potential is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases. Some gases, such as hydrogen chloride, under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed \\"polyelectrolytes\\", which contain charged functional groups. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes, informally known as \\"lytes\\". - A neuromuscular junction (or myoneural junction) is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. It is at the neuromuscular junction that a motor neuron is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber, causing muscle contraction. - Neuromuscular disease is a very broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that impair the functioning of the muscles, either directly, being pathologies of the voluntary muscle, or indirectly, being pathologies of nerves or neuromuscular junctions.

One day, I complained to my father about having to go milk those cows, saying it was tiring. He said, you know, boy, to work is a blessing. I looked at the men who'd worked harder. I had a feeling I had been told something really important, but it took many years before it sank in. Back then, going to college was a rare privilege. My father told me if I'd picked something to study that I liked doing, I'd always look forward to my work. But he also added, even having a job you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined a military program to help pay for college. And what started out as an obligation to the Army became a way of life that I had been devoted to for 37 years. In the late 1980s, during a visit to Bangladesh, I saw a woman with her baby on her back, breaking bricks with a hammer. I asked a local officer why they weren't using a machine to make the work easier. He told me a machine would put that lady out of work. And as bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: to work is a blessing. After seeing a lot of people like that woman in Bangladesh, I've come to believe that people without jobs are not free. They're victims of crime, poor health, and depression.

UPDATED:. 09:43 EST, 19 March 2012. Support: A series of leaked emails reveals Asma al-Assad's support for her husband. Asma al-Assad, the British-born wife of the Syrian president, told a friend in a leaked email that she was the ‘real dictator’ in the family. Mrs Assad, 36, appears to show no misgivings about the regime’s brutal crackdown against dissenters, according to the latest extracts from her private emails. She praises a speech by her husband for conveying a sense of being ‘very strong, no more messing around.’ And she even makes light of the president’s reputation, joking in one exchange with a friend about domestic relations: ‘As for listening - I am the REAL dictator, he has no choice.’ Mrs al-Assad is often portrayed as an unwitting partner to her husband as he conducts a campaign of violence against many of his own people. But the string of emails sent to her husband as well as friends and family members, shows she is, in fact, fully behind his policies. In one message to a family friend she refers to a speech her husband had made describing it as 'very strong, no more messing around'. And she even changed the wording of a viral joke email, to make fun of the people of Homs - the city at the centre of the uprising where the United Nations estimates thousands have been killed. She had received the email - with the subject line 'Student who obtained 0% in exam' - from her husband. But before she forwarded it on to her father and two other family members she changed the wording to read: 'A really bright Homsi student'. In another email her father, Harley Street cardiologist Dr Fawak Akhras, compared the Syrian government's assault on Homs to Britain's reaction to the riots last summer. Mrs Assad, who has three children, grew up in leafy Acton. Although Muslim, she went to a Church of England school, where friends called her Emma. After studying computer science and French literature at King’s College, London, she worked as a banker at JP Morgan in the Nineties when she started secretly dating Bashar, the nerdy former eye doctor being groomed to succeed his despotic father in Syria. Bashar took power in 2000 amidst hopes he would relax the regime and dismantle the network of security forces. But despite many promises, there have been few real changes. The collection of around around 3,000 emails from the private accounts of the couple were obtained by opposition activists who have released them to the media. In one sent to her husband on December 28th she shows she is fully aware just how serious the threat to his regime had got. 'If we are strong together, we will overcome this together .... I love you.' 'We will overcome this together': Despite the killing and oppression of his own people, Bashar al-Assad's wife is standing by him. Although they do not use each others' real names, experts say they are certain the emails are genuine and that the true identities are beyond reasonable doubt. Other emails revealed how, as the fighting in Syria raged, Mrs al-Assad was mainly concerned with how to get around international sanctions that prevented her from shopping online. ‘I am absolutely clueless when it comes to fine jewellery,’ she wrote to her cousin while awaiting a delivery of gold, onyx and diamond-encrusted necklaces being made for her in Paris. In another email she oragnises a delivery of new furniture through a Dubai shipping company. Meanwhile in Syria government forces clashed with gunmen in an upscale neighborhood of the capital Damascus - home to embassies and senior officials - in one of the worst confrontations in the tightly-controlled city center in the country's yearlong uprising. The pro-government reports said the clash left three 'terrorists' and a member of the security forces dead. It said one of the attackers was captured and three security troops were wounded. Shocking violence: Syrians have been left reeling after several bomb attacks in the country's capital. Damascus. Investigators inspect the blast scene outside a damaged building following a car bomb in Syria's second largest city of Aleppo. Shocking violence: Syrians were left reeling after the dramatic blasts at security buildings in the heart of the troubled country's capital Damascus. Damascus has been largely free of the daily shootings and deaths reported across the country since the uprising against Assad began in March last year. But the capital has witnessed several major bomb attacks targeting security facilities, most recently on Saturday. The government blames 'terrorists' for the bombings but the opposition says that the regime itself may be carrying them out to discredit the uprising. The new fighting shows that rebels can still strike in the heart of the capital despite successful government offensive in the past weeks in the suburbs of Damascus, in the central city of Homs and the northern region of Idlib. Supplies: Rebels of the Free Syrian Army, who have sought refuge in the. mountains close to Al-Janoudia village, in Idlib province in northern. Syria, pass food and other supplies to comrades across a river. Defiant: Syrian rebels have set up check-points and road blocks in the north of the Idlib region. Syrian authorities claim the opposition is made up of 'terrorist' groups carrying out a foreign conspiracy. An activist in the capital said the Monday morning clashes occurred near the Political Security Directorate building. He said the clashes were followed with raids by security forces who were searching for the attackers. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists throughout Syria, said 18 of Assad's troops were wounded in the clashes. It described the clashes \\"as the most violent of its kind and closest to security centers in Damascus since the revolution began.\\" The rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes thousands of army defectors, have claimed responsibility in the past for attacks against regime forces. The group's leader, Col. Riad al-Asaad, refused to comment on the fighting in Damascus when contacted by The Associated Press by telephone. \\"This is a sensitive military matter that we cannot comment about,\\" he said from Turkey. On Saturday, three suicide bombings in Damascus killed 27 people. Two of them also targeted government security buildings. On Sunday, an explosion killed two and wounded 30 in the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest. Arms deliveries to Syria surged almost 600 percent from 2007 to 2011 compared with the previous five years, a leading think tank said on Monday, with Russia supplying the bulk of the country's weapons. The report underlined how Moscow has continued to supply Syria with firepower while the United States, European Union and others have imposed arms embargoes in response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's bloody crackdown on unrest. World powers have been unable to stop more than a year of bloodshed in Syria, a country that sits on the fault lines of several regional and ethnic conflicts. Recent army gains against rebel positions have not succeeded in quelling the violence and no negotiated settlement is in sight. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)said Russia had supplied 78 per cent of Syria's weapons imports during the past five years, contributing to a 580 per cent increase in the volume of arms imports by Syria. 'The transfer of arms to states affected by the Arab Spring has provoked public and parliamentary debate in a number of supplier states,\\" said Mark Bromley, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'However, the impact of these debates on states' arms export policies has, up to now, been limited.' Global arms transfers in the period rose by almost a quarter. The five largest importers were all Asian states, with Asia and Oceania accounting for 44 percent of purchases, followed by Europe at 19 percent, the Middle East at 17 percent, the Americas 11 percent and Africa 9 percent. India was the world's single largest importer of arms, accounting for 10 percent of the total, followed by South Korea, Pakistan, China and Singapore. China, the largest recipient of arms during the previous 2002-2006 period, fell in the rankings due to increased domestic production. SIPRI uses a system which attempts to measure volume rather than the financial value of weapons transfers. It does this by using a methodology which intends instead to represent the transfer of military resources. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"1. Leaked emails reveal Asma al-Assad, the British-born wife of Syrian president, told a friend that she was the ‘real dictator’ in the family.

Approximately 360,000 individuals acquire genital warts each year in the United States alone. Genital warts may appear as a small bump or group of bumps. There is great variance in the appearance and size of genital warts. They may appear small or large, raised off the skin or flat, or may appear lumpy like a cauliflower crown. If left untreated, genital warts may go away on their own, they may remain unchanged, or they may spread and grow larger. Genital warts that grow large and spread to the birth canal may cause complications during a pregnancy. Cervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer in women living in under-developed regions of the world. In 2012 it caused almost 270,000 deaths worldwide. Cervical cancer usually does not present any noticeable symptoms until it enters advanced stages, at which point it can become life-threatening and difficult to treat. Having regular Pap tests can help identify and treat cervical cancer before it enters the advanced stages. Regular Pap tests are the most effective means of detecting and preventing cervical cancer. Though cervical cancer is the most serious complication related to HPV transmission, the virus has been linked to numerous other types of cancers that can affect both men and women worldwide. Vulvar cancer - cancer of the vulva (the outer portion of female genitalia) is often caused by HPV. Almost seven out of every ten cases of vulvar cancer, and virtually all incidents of vulvar pre-cancer, are linked to HPV transmission. Routine physical examinations by a medical professional are the best means of detecting vulvar cancer. Vaginal cancer - over seven out of every ten cases of vaginal cancer are linked to HPV transmission. The same Pap tests used to detect cervical cancer are sometimes used to detect vaginal cancer and pre-cancer. Penile cancer - men exposed to high-risk HPV strains may develop cancer of the penis. In fact, roughly six out of every ten cases of penile cancer are linked to HPV transmission. There is currently no approved screening test to detect the early stages of penile cancer, and many cases go undetected until the later stages of cancer. Anal cancer - nearly all cases of squamous cell cancer of the anus across both men and women are caused by HPV transmission. The best way to detect anal cancer is by performing an anal cytology test, sometimes referred to as an anal Pap test. These exams are typically only performed on individuals determined to be at a high risk of cancer formation, such as people with compromised immune systems or individuals who have received an organ transplant. Mouth and throat cancer - over seven out of every ten cases of cancer in the back of the throat (including the tongue and tonsils) are linked to HPV transmission. Mouth and throat cancer, also known as oropharyngeal cancer, does not currently have any approved screening test to detect the early stages. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article discusses genital warts, a common complication of human papillomavirus (HPV) affecting approximately 360,000 individuals annually in the United States. Genital warts can vary in appearance and size, and may, in some cases, disappear on their own or grow larger if left untreated. The article also highlights cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in women in underdeveloped regions and is often linked to HPV. Regular Pap tests are crucial in detecting and preventing cervical cancer. Additionally, the article points out that HPV is connected to other cancer types such as vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, mouth, and throat cancers. While some of these cancers can be detected through physical examinations and specific tests like anal cytology or anal Pap tests, others currently do not have approved screening tests for early detection."},{"question":"What happens next? A woman stands in a kitchen, staring at the camera. the person Pick from: i. opens an oven and pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies.. ii. holds up a toothbrush from a drawer.. iii. then takes a bottle, pours some powder in, and then pours it over the woman's face.. iv. uses a peeler to scrub potatoes..","response":"Given the context provided, the most logical next sequence of actions would be: i. The person opens an oven and pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies. Reasoning: a) The scene is set in a kitchen, so tasks directly related to food preparation or cooking are more likely. b) Using a toothbrush in a kitchen doesn't make sense unless there's clear context for it (such as cleaning something). c) Pouring powder over the woman's face in a kitchen context is not logical unless it's specified this is a cooking show with a playful prank or something to that effect. d) Scrubbing potatoes is a probable scenario too, but pulling out cookies from an oven connects more naturally to the figure of a woman standing in the kitchen, suggesting a baked goods result. It also gives a direct interaction with the woman who's the primary subject here. Peeling potatoes would still leave the woman's role undefined, making the cookies scenario the better choice."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: BELLSOUTH is still in business to this day.

Then you add the fresh basil leaves , halved grape tomatoes , chopped garlic & black pepper . Stir it all up until the tomatoes are mostly warm . OPTIONS: 1. vegetarianism; 2. A low carb diet; 3. a fish only diet; 4. A fruit only diet; Answer the following question: What lifestyle might the narrator follow ?","response":"Based on the provided information, it appears that the narrator might be following a vegetarian lifestyle. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that their new favorite meal, Linguine with goat cheese, fresh basil, and grape tomatoes, does not include any meat products. Additionally, their use of ingredients like fresh basil leaves, halved grape tomatoes, and chopped garlic emphasizes their preference for plant-based foods. Vegetarianism is a dietary lifestyle that abstains from consuming meat and may include consuming dairy products and eggs depending on the individual's preferences. Although the other listed lifestyle options (low carb diet, fish only diet, and fruit only diet) could potentially be followed by the narrator, there is not enough evidence to support these in the given context. For instance, a low carb diet would typically involve reducing carbohydrate intake, especially from sources like pasta (like Linguine mentioned). On the other hand, a fish only diet would focus on seafood consumption while avoiding other meat types, but it is not mentioned whether the narrator consumes fish or not. Lastly, a fruit only diet is also less likely since the narrator mentions eating pasta, cheese, and vegetables, which don't fit into a fruit-only food plan. Thus, considering the available information, it seems that the narrator follows a vegetarian lifestyle."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Options are: +negative +positive I think the answer is","response":"-neutral. The sentiment embodied by this statement is neutral in nature. Evaluating sentiment is a matter of identifying the tone or the emotional state prompted by the message. In this scenario, the tweet seems to be simply conveying information about two events. There's a concert by Bob Hund starting at 21.00 and a party at Strand starting at 22.00. There doesn't appear to be any expression of particular emotion, such as joy, sadness, anger, or delight. There aren't any negative or positive connotations; rather, it seems like the user is possibly trying to figure out how to attend both events or is sharing this information with others, or perhaps pointing out a scheduling conflict. In the statement, there is no indication of dissatisfaction or complaint (signs of negative sentiment) nor expressions of joy or anticipation (markers of positive sentiment) about the two events or their timings. The statement is free of subjective sentiments, emotions, or opinions. However, without more context, such as additional tweets or knowledge of the tweeter's preferences in music or parties, it is difficult to state definitively. Sentiment analysis is often dependent on the context in which the information is presented. As the provided information doesn’t direct us towards any particular sentiment, we categorize it as neutral. Although, if we dive deep into speculation - if the tweeter is a fan of Bob Hund's music and loves parties at the Strand and having them back-to-back gives them joy then it could be seen as positive, or if the schedule clash irritates them then it might be seen as negative. But without explicit expressions or further context indicating either, the stand-alone statement would be categorized as neutral."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. If they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight, how many skips will they total?. Explanation:","response":"To find the total number of skips for Roberto and Valerie, we need to calculate the number of skips each of them can make during the 15-minute period and then add those numbers together. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. Convert the given rate for Roberto from \\"per hour\\" to \\"per minute\\": Roberto can skip 4,200 times per hour, so to find out his skips per minute, divide 4,200 by the number of minutes in an hour (which is 60 minutes). 4,200 skips ÷ 60 minutes = 70 skips per minute 2. Find the number of skips for Roberto in 15 minutes: Now that we know Roberto can skip 70 times per minute, we can find out how many times he can skip in 15 minutes. 70 skips per minute × 15 minutes = 1,050 skips 3. Find the number of skips for Valerie in 15 minutes: Valerie can skip 80 times per minute, so we can calculate her total skips during the 15 minutes. 80 skips per minute × 15 minutes = 1,200 skips 4. Calculate the total number of skips for both Roberto and Valerie: Add the skips for both Roberto and Valerie to find the total number of skips. 1,050 skips (Roberto) + 1,200 skips (Valerie) = 2,250 skips So, the correct answer is that Roberto and Valerie will make a total of 2,250 skips if they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence. It was more difficult for the woman to identify the type of plant than the type of fern, because the","response":"plant species in question exhibited a wide range of morphological variations, overlapping characteristics with other plant families, and had adaptability to diverse environmental conditions, whereas the ferns displayed more distinct features that were relatively consistent and well-documented, making them easier to recognize and classify. The task of identifying the type of plant initially posed a significant challenge for the woman, as the plant kingdom is known to be extensive and diverse, containing over 390,000 known species. Within this vast array of species, many plants have evolved with similar physical appearances and traits as a result of convergent evolution or hybridization, making it difficult to determine their exact taxonomy based on morphology alone. Furthermore, some plant species are phenotypically plastic, meaning their traits can change in response to different environments. This plasticity can further complicate the identification process, as it can result in individual plants of the same species displaying divergent characteristics in different environments. In contrast, ferns, which belong to a more specific group within the plant kingdom, are relatively easier to recognize and classify due to their somewhat unique set of features. Ferns are vascular plants that reproduce via spores rather than seeds and have specialized fronds that function as leaves. They belong to the class Polypodiopsida and include around 9,000 to 10,000 known species. The characteristics that distinguish ferns from other plant groups are generally well-documented, which simplifies the process of identifying a particular type of fern. Their leaves, or fronds, display a range of predetermined shapes and patterns, allowing them to be more readily identifiable when compared to other plant species. Additionally, the individual structures that make up fern fronds, such as pinnae and pinnules, can be examined to assist in determining the specific type of fern in question. Another reason the woman found it more difficult to identify the type of plant than the type of fern was the availability and reliability of resources and documentation. The plant kingdom is continuously expanding as researchers continue to discover and describe new species, making it more challenging to keep up with the latest information and accurate classification tools. On the other hand, ferns have been more extensively studied and documented, making it relatively easier to access reliable identification keys and sources on their taxonomy. Lastly, the woman may have found it more difficult to identify the plant due to her own level of expertise and familiarity with plant species. Those with less knowledge and experience in botany are more likely to struggle with correctly identifying a plant species, as they may not be aware of specific traits and features to look for or may have difficulty differentiating between similar-looking species. In contrast, the woman may have had more experience or knowledge about ferns, thus allowing her to more confidently identify the type of fern in question. Overall, the complexity of the plant kingdom, overlapping characteristics with other plant families, the adaptability of plant species to diverse environmental conditions, and the woman's possible lack of botanical expertise contributed to the difficulty in identifying the type of plant as compared to the type of fern, which exhibited more recognizable features and had a more established classification system."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: It is the same amount which would be incurred for the same treatment in their home Member State.

To better address the question of decision types made by great powers, it is important to delve deeper into the various domains in which these powers wield their influence and the nature of decisions made in these areas. In general, great powers involve themselves in an array of strategic, political, economic, and socio-cultural decisions. 1. Strategic decisions: Great powers are often involved in determining the course of international security, preventative diplomacy, regional conflicts, and military intervention. Their military capabilities allow them to assume leadership in security initiatives, forge alliances, and shape the global balance of power. 2. Political decisions: Great powers can influence political decision-making on a global scale by endorsing or opposing certain leaders, governments, or political ideologies. Through diplomatic engagements, they can help create or reform international treaties, norms, and organizations that guide the conduct of global affairs. Examples include participation in the United Nations Security Council and influencing outcomes on a wide range of political issues like human rights, international law, and environmental policies. 3. Economic decisions: Armed with economic prowess, great powers have the capacity to affect global trade, monetary, and fiscal policies. They often play instrumental roles in the establishment of international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, as well as in the crafting of trade agreements. Their currency, market size, and investment potential often act as main driving forces shaping world economic trends. 4. Socio-cultural decisions: Great powers can exert considerable influence in the realm of socio-cultural decisions, promoting their culture, values, and beliefs throughout the world. They often lead in areas of cultural, educational, and scientific exchanges, broadening the global understanding and appreciation of their customs and ideas. In doing so, they solidify their soft power and increase their influence both locally and internationally. In summary, while the initial sentence does not directly answer the question about the types of decisions made by great powers, it sets the stage for understanding the influential role they play in various areas. Great powers are involved in strategic, political, economic, and socio-cultural decisions shaping the international landscape, and their participation in negotiations and discussions is vital to global harmony and progress."},{"question":"News article: Tannhäuser; Simon Boccanegra - review Berlin Staatsoper’s ‘hard to fault’ Tannhäuser at the Schiller theatre, with Marina Prudenskaya as Venus and Peter Seiffert outstanding in the title role. Photograph: Bernd Uhlig In Berlin, history and politics dart across your path at every turn. This extends to musical life too. The headline event of Daniel Barenboim's Festtage, the annual spring festival organised by the Berlin State Opera, was an arresting new production of Wagner's Tannhäuser by the German choreographer Sasha Waltz, stunningly performed by a star cast led by Peter Seiffert. Barenboim, at Waltz's request, used the Venusberg ballet music of the 1860/61 Paris edition, combined with the original Dresden score of 1845. In whichever version, Wagner's sprawling exploration of flesh versus spirit contains some of his most potent music. Stand-alone numbers, such as Wolfram's celebrated Song to the Evening Star, had not yet given way to the through-composed structures of his mature works. The one important point to know about its complex chronology, however, is that Wagner had been working on Tristan und Isolde in the intervening years. The new Venusberg music for Tannhäuser, in its languid, extreme chromatic richness, epitomised sexual satiety to an even greater degree, with more excessive freedom, than anything found in Tristan. No wonder Baudelaire, as well as Wilde's Dorian Gray, fell upon this tale of a medieval troubadour as the ultimate hymn to decadence. Last week the promise of a near-naked bacchanal at the start – dancers in none too concealing body stockings tumbling like bugs to the lowest rim of the open-ended cupola which represented the Mount of Venus – had whetted Berliner appetites. One of the first to hurry into the foyer of the Schiller theatre, the company's temporary base while its Unter den Linden home is rebuilt, was a tiny, bright-eyed 100-year-old. His identity, rather than his grand age, are of interest here. Hans Pischner, a virtuoso harpsichordist and musicologist, was one of the most powerful cultural commissars in the GDR period. He was intendant of the Staatsoper for two decades in the last years of a divided Germany, frequently caught in the crossfire of obedience, conservatism and experiment. \\"He was very controversial, close to the state and all that that entails,\\" a Berlin opera insider said, as Pischner walked past us. \\"But now? Hey, he's an old man of a hundred.\\" Pischner's influence was not merely local. Indirectly he changed the shape of opera throughout Europe and America. He supported Ruth Berghaus, the East German choreographer and director who pioneered the updated or abstract productions now known as \\"Regietheater\\" – director's theatre. Hated by the GDR but adored by the west, not least our own English National Opera in productions by David Alden and others, this style now holds sway. Pischner might be proud that Berghaus's 1968 Barber of Seville is still in the Staastoper repertory, receiving its 350th performance just a few weeks ago. The mix of old and new still looks modern. For Tannhäuser, Waltz opted for a simple updating to the 1950s – particularly echoing the wood-panelled Schiller theatre which was built in that decade. Odd though the prancing Thuringian knights looked in tweeds and jodhpurs, nothing was too obtrusive. The dance, mostly independent of the action, was some of the most sympathetic – that is, non-distracting – I have seen in opera. Act 2, the Hall of Song in the Wartburg, looked particularly handsome, with floor-to-ceiling wood swinging like a bamboo screen. The sight, and sound, of 12 horn players striding across the bare stage was thrilling. This relatively low-key approach provided an ideal vessel for the music, in a performance hard to fault. Peter Seiffert, the Heldentenor who recorded the role with Barenboim in 2001, retains a ferocious vocal strength, rarely tiring and never forcing the sound. He carried off the Venusberg love-in rather impressively, looking like a teddy bear among the svelte dancers, and clutching any limb, male or female, that came his way. Marina Prudenskaya's Venus was properly voluptuous and musically secure. Ann Petersen as the virginal Elisabeth, splendid in an Ava Gardner-style satin gown, showed the intelligence and strong-mindedness of a role that can seem merely prudish, making up for some unevenness of tone. René Pape shone as the Landgraf, but the loudest applause, with reason, went to Peter Mattei as Wolfram. The mix of beauty of sound and an ability to act, using silent movie gestures with great expressivity, was as good as it gets. Barenboim, who had conducted the Vienna Philharmonic in Mozart's three final symphonies – from memory – the previous night in the Philharmonie, drawing fresh, noble playing from this finest of orchestras, was in his element. His interpretation never sounded mannered or interventionist (this was true, which may surprise some, in the Mozart too), tempi were steady but never dragged and, from where I was sitting, the orchestra never drowned the singers. The cheers went on for 15 minutes. Less than 24 hours later, Barenboim was back again to conduct Plácido Domingo in a revival of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, rather too safely directed by Federico Tiezzi with plenty of Italianate gothic gold and doge's palace ornamentation. The interest, as ever with Domingo, was to see how he has grown into the role, his voice now sounding more genuinely baritone than when he made the switch from tenor. If there were a few bumps musically, the score not always flowing as freely as it should, Domingo's performance more than made up. To watch this artist grow gracefully into old age, vocally and physically, is a privilege. Next season, Barenboim will celebrate his friend and mentor Pierre Boulez at 90. Why Boulez? Because, Barenboim said at a press conference the morning after Boccanegra – no doubt his idea of relaxation – \\"Pierre has always encouraged the public to listen in a more unconventional way\\". As usual, Barenboim came up with a provocative point of view that made us think. Star ratings (out of 5) Tannhäuser ****Simon Boccanegra *** What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"Alright, my little friend, let's talk about the main parts of this big-kid article. It's all about a big music event with lots of songs and singing. 1. Big Festival in Berlin: Every year, Berlin in Germany has a big music festival in the springtime, organized by the Berlin State Opera. This year, a new show of a famous old song-story called 'Tannhäuser' was a big deal. It was put together by a famous dance-maker named Sasha Waltz, and many famous singers came together to put on a great performance. 2. Hans Pischner visited: A really old man named Hans Pischner, who used to be very important in the music world in Germany, came to see the show. He's a 100 years old! He had a big influence on how operas (big singing-story shows) are done in Europe and America. 3. The show 'Tannhäuser': The review talks a lot about the show 'Tannhäuser'. The lead singer, Peter Seiffert, was really good, and the other singers were also praised, especially Peter Mattei as Wolfram. 4. Other performances: They also played another singing-story called 'Simon Boccanegra'. The writer thinks famous singer Placido Domingo has improved in his singing role, even though the music did have few hiccups here and there. 5. Rating: In the end, the writer gives both of the performances stars out of five to show how much he liked them. Four out of five stars for 'Tannhäuser', and 'Simon Boccanegra' gets three. So it's mainly about the music festival in Berlin, two big performances there, and a 100-year-old visitor. Isn't it exciting how so many people come together just to sing and play beautiful music?"},{"question":"Cohan appeared in 1930 in a revival of his tribute to vaudeville and his father, The Song and Dance Man. In 1932, Cohan starred in a dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign double in the Hollywood musical film The Phantom President. The film co-starred Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Durante, with songs by Rodgers and Hart, and was released by Paramount Pictures. He appeared in some earlier silent films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other sound film, Gambling (1934), based on his own 1929 play and shot in New York City. A critic called Gambling a \\"stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique.\\" It is considered a lost film. Cohan earned acclaim as a serious actor in Eugene O'Neill's only comedy, Ah, Wilderness! (1933), and in the role of a song-and-dance President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rodgers and Hart's musical I'd Rather Be Right (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play called Fulton of Oak Falls, starring Cohan. His final play, The Return of the Vagabond (1940), featured a young Celeste Holm in the cast. In 1940, Judy Garland played the title role in a film version of his 1922 musical Little Nellie Kelly. Cohan's mystery play Seven Keys to Baldpate was first filmed in 1916 and has been remade seven times, most recently as House of Long Shadows (1983), starring Vincent Price. In 1942, a musical biopic of Cohan, Yankee Doodle Dandy, was released, and James Cagney's performance in the title role earned the Best Actor Academy Award. The film was privately screened for Cohan as he battled the last stages of abdominal cancer; Cohan's comment on Cagney's performance was, \\"My God, what an act to follow!\\" Cohan's 1920 play The Meanest Man in the World was filmed in 1943 with Jack Benny.

The \\"Lost Boys\\" actor and his ex-girlfriend, Danielle Schreiber, conceived Gus via in vitro fertilization. Since their split, they have disagreed over the role Patric, 48, was to play in the boy's life, and the law defines him as merely a sperm donor. This bill would allow sperm donors to petition for rights to a child if they can prove a certain level of intended involvement. \\"I have to be Gus' voice - my son - a voice that I have not heard in 25 weeks, a voice that is not allowed to mention my name in his mother's home, a voice that has sent me here to speak to you all,\\" Patric said. He added that he was also speaking out on behalf of other men in his situation. \\"We raised these children, we loved these children, but when these relationships fell apart we were shockingly hit with briefs that deemed us 'sperm donors': a word that was never, ever mentioned in my house, a word I can guarantee you Gus doesn't know how to pronounce,\\" Patric said. Jason Patric Advocates For Sperm Donors' Rights Patric argued that a \\"a loophole\\" in the law gives his child's mother the right to keep him from their child because Gus was conceived with artificial reproduction technology and because the couple wasn't married. Speaking again on behalf of others in his situation, he said, \\"We all tried to become parents. We went to great lengths to become parents. I had a surgery to become a parent … [but] I was unfairly deemed a donor with no recourse.\\" The bill, \\"doesn't give me my son back … [but] it gives standing for men to constitutionally get their rights and go into court and say, 'I'm the dad,' and let a judge decide if he's not,\\" Patric added. \\"I haven't seen Gus in 25 weeks, and I just want you to think about that number in case you have a child or you've lost a child.\\" He's also concerned about the welfare of his son, whom he said could be \\"sitting daily, wondering what happened in the most severe form of alienation that one could imagine.\\" Patty Glaser, an attorney for Gus's mother, Schreiber, told ABC News a different story. Patric \\"was quite clear\\" prior to the child's conception and during Schreiber's pregnancy, she said, that he did not want to be a father. In fact, she claimed, Patric wanted his role in the pregnancy to be a secret. \\"The moment they broke up, he demanded 50/50 custody,\\" Glaser said. \\"She said, 'What are you talking about?' That doesn't make any sense. Being a parent is a big responsibility. You don't get to move in and out of parenting between acting jobs. It's a full-time job.\\" Glaser noted that the bill Patric was testifying about is on hold. \\"If Jason Patric were the devil or a saint, irrespective of that conclusion, either way, the legislation needs fixing,\\" she said. \\"It is vague, ambiguous and it's horrific for mothers. … Moms should have a say in this, and the legislation is drafted irrespective of what moms want. That's silly.\\" ||||| 'Lost Boys' actor Jason Patric, who lost a battle for custody of a son conceived using in vitro fertilization, urges California lawmakers to change the law to afford such men greater consideration in court. Many women's rights groups are skeptical. Actor Jason Patric (l.) urged lawmakers to approve a bill that would allow him another chance to seek paternity rights for his 3-year-old son, while appearing before the Assembly Judiciary Committee in Sacramento, Calif., on Tuesday, Aug. 13, 2013. Amid pleas by “Lost Boys” actor Jason Patric and other sperm donors to receive the greater legal rights afforded to fathers, California lawmakers on Tuesday began wrestling with this sensitive issue: Who can claim fatherhood of a child conceived in a lab, and under what circumstances? Mr. Patric – whose ex-girlfriend last year won custody of a son, now 3, conceived through in vitro fertilization – spoke at a hearing where state lawmakers are considering a bill that would give judges in child-custody cases greater latitude to take into account the interests of the men involved. Whether and how much to adjust the balance of maternal and paternal rights is a longtime question, made more complicated by modern advances in reproductive medicine that allow for \\"test tube babies,\\" pregnancies through surrogates, and other innovations. The stakes are high for the men and women involved, but also for the children growing up in a society in which lineage can be confusing, if not outright mysterious, say some family studies experts. “We’re at an unusual point for families in general,” says Randal Day, a family studies professor at Brigham Young University, in Salt Lake City. “We’re racing ahead at a breakneck pace of change without really knowing how it’s going to affect us down the road.” Patric is currently appealing a judge’s decision that gave full custody of Gus, his son with Danielle Schreiber, to the boy’s mother, in large part because the pair had no written agreement as to the parental arrangement. Patric assumed he would stay involved with the boy; Ms. Schreiber said that was never part of the deal. Either way, Patric was involved in the boy’s life until Schreiber decided to fight for sole custody. Turned aside by the courts, the actor appealed to the California legislature to address what he sees as a parental injustice and institutional prejudice against men. “The fact is, I had a little modicum of fame to bring light to a problem that’s going to affect in such a horrific manner children and families,” he said. “I didn’t donate my sperm; I gave my sperm to have a child.… I want my son back,” he said during an interview with ABC's Katie Couric in June. In emotional but measured testimony Tuesday, Patric said he went to \\"great lengths,\\" including surgery, to become a father. He said both he and Schreiber signed an \\"intended parent\\" document, but that current California law prevented him from making his case before a judge. Other men have complained about the same thing, he said. The emergence of sperm banks and the high success rate for in vitro fertilization have created markets where would-be moms can shop for the right attributes in a sperm donor without having to deal with the actual man. They have opened new options for older unmarried women, as well as for same-sex couples who want to raise children who are biologically connected to one of them. But the effects of those advances concern some researchers, including Mr. Day. “There’s a fundamental contribution that men make,” but it's being tested by an emerging view among some mothers, or would-be mothers, that “’I want your sperm because you’re good-looking, you have a high IQ, and you do OK on personality tests, but basically I don’t want you around,\\" he says. Day cites the unknown effects of what he calls “intergenerational confusion,” in which traditional roles such as fathers, mothers, aunts, uncles, and grandparents are upended in part by government policies such as welfare but also by changing cultural mores in which women hold increased power over child-bearing and in determining family structure. Worry that women would see their parental rights erode is why the National Organization for Women and some other feminist groups oppose the bill considered Tuesday by a panel of the California Assembly. Giving judges greater discretion on custody cases involving in vitro fertilization, they argue, would whittle away at women’s autonomy by ceding some power to sperm donors who suddenly want a greater-than-planned role in raising the child. \\"Parents, reliant on a sperm donor's agreement not to parent, could have allowed the donor to develop a close relationship with the child, without thinking that he could later come in and demand paternal rights,\\" warned Assemblyman Tom Ammiano in a letter to the Assembly Judiciary Committee in June. Assemblyman Jerry Hill, who introduced the measure in the lower chamber after it passed the state Senate without opposition, says the tweak is succinct enough to give judges options only in cases where fathers have made a significant and involved contribution to the rearing of the child. \\"This is truly about the modern family, and it has raised questions and issues for the courts that haven't kept up with changing times,\\" he told the Associated Press. Last month, Mr. Hill told Ms. Couric that some groups fear “sperm donors will be coming out of the woodwork, flooding the courts to test parenting rights with children that they have created.” But the reality, he suggested, “is that there’s only a small universe of individuals that this [California bill] really affects.” The committee voted 5-to-2 Tuesday to hold the bill in committee for further discussion. Hill said after the hearing that he will continue to work with various parties to reach agreement on the legislation. Anthropologist Peter Gray of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, author of “Fatherhood: “Evolution and Human Paternal Behavior, agrees that the number of men affected by the suggested tweak in California law is probably small. But he argues that the issue is nonetheless important. “This [bill] is conceptually important, because it’s trying in a sense to lay out a framework that will accommodate men who want to be involved in quite variable genetic or social backdrops.” The case also resonates because it contradicts social and even biological stereotypes about men, says Mr. Gray. “More broadly, we’re often surprised if men want to stick around beyond sperm donations when they have the opportunity to leave, which is part of what makes this [Patric-Schreiber] case so interesting,” he says. “This guy wants to be involved, even though it’s an uphill battle.” Material from Associated Press was used in this report. |||||","response":"Actor Jason Patric appeared before California's Assembly Judiciary Committee to lobby for a bill that would allow him to seek paternity rights for his 3-year-old son, Gus, who was conceived by in vitro fertilization with his ex-girlfriend, Danielle Schreiber.

Premise: The premise expresses a sense of sadness about people with the financial resources and the ability to employ professionals, essentially using their wealth to avoid paying taxes or investing in loss-generating assets for the purpose of tax reductions. Key themes in the premise: 1. Sadness over people with resources. 2. The ability to hire professionals to help avoid paying taxes. 3. Investing in loss-making assets for tax reduction purposes. Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the person feels perfectly okay with people finding ways to avoid paying taxes. Key themes in the hypothesis: 1. Acceptance of tax avoidance methods. 2. No mention of resources or having the money to do so. Upon comparing the key themes of the premise and the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The underlying sentiment of the premise reflects sadness and a sense of injustice due to wealth and resources being used for tax evasion purposes. In contrast, the hypothesis suggests a sense of acceptance and comfort with tax avoidance behavior. In summary, the premise does not entail the hypothesis as the sentiments expressed in both statements are diametrically opposed. The hypothesis conveys acceptance of tax avoidance behavior while the premise communicates disapproval and sadness about individuals leveraging their wealth to minimize or evade tax obligations."},{"question":"What key details about sobekemsaf ii can be extracted from the following bio?

Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","response":"Based on the provided data, a comprehensive description would delve into the elements of location, language, cuisine, and leadership. The Southeast Asian nation of Indonesia, now considered the world's largest island country, boasts an extensive linguistic culture. With over 700 living languages spoken, the primary language of this diverse country is Indonesian. Indonesian language, also known as Bahasa Indonesia, serves not only as the national language but also as a lingua franca, unifying over 270 million people inhabiting more than 17,000 islands of the Indonesian archipelago. The culinary aspect holds a significant place in the cultural representation of Indonesia. One of the notable mentions here is 'Bakso,' a popular Indonesian dish. Bakso is a delectable meatball, or a meat paste made from beef surimi, and is commonly found in the streets of almost all regions of Indonesia. It's a beloved comfort food, often served in a bowl of beef broth, with noodles, rice vermicelli, tofu, and crisp, tasty condiments. However, this provided data also sheds light on an interesting crossover. Not confined to the Indonesian terrain, Bakso's influence can be traced in Chinese cuisine as well. This intermingling testifies to the cultural exchange between the two countries, which is particularly apparent in the culinary arena. Different variants of Bakso within Chinese cuisine might exist, indicating the degree of cultural assimilation and adaptation. Indonesia, in addition to its rich cultural diversity, shares a vibrant political scenario. As per the data, the country's helm is currently under the command of leader Joko Widodo. Joko Widodo, often identified by his colloquial name Jokowi, is serving as the President of Indonesia. His governance spans across various levels, including local city, province, and now the entire nation, highlighting the dynamic nature of political leadership in Indonesia. His presidency encapsulates the aspects of reformative policies and democratic principles, furthering the country's growth. In essence, the data offers a brief but effective encapsulation of Indonesia from various perspectives. It provides insights into the Indonesian linguistic, culinary, and political landscape. Moreover, it underscores the diffusion of elements, such as Bakso, beyond geographical boundaries, enriching the cultural fabric of different nations."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Twentieth Century Fox Television (TCFTV, stylized as 20th Century Fox Television) is the television production subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, and a production arm of the Fox Television Group (both are owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox). 20th Television is the syndication and distribution arm of 20th Century Fox Television.

According to traditional superstition, such clovers bring good luck, though it is not clear when or how that superstition got started. The earliest mention of \`\`Fower-leafed or purple grasse'' is from 1640 and simply says that it was kept in gardens because it was \`\`good for the purples in children or others''. A description from 1869 says that four-leaf clovers were \`\`gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day''. The first reference to luck might be from an 11-year-old girl, who wrote in an 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine, \`\`Did the fairies ever whisper in your ear, that a four-leaf clover brought good luck to the finder?'' Question: are there such things as four leaf clovers? Available options: (i) no; (ii) yes;","response":"(ii) Yes, four-leaf clovers do exist. They are a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover, which is scientifically known as Trifolium repens, and part of the legume family. What distinguishes a four-leaf clover is the presence of one additional leaflet than the usual three-leaflet clover. The reason why these clovers are rare is due to its genetic mutation and environmental conditions. The exact cause of the genetic variation is not entirely clear, but it's believed to involve a recessive gene inherited from both parents. Four-leaf clovers are renowned worldwide, due to their rarity and the myths and legends associated with them. According to traditional superstition, finding a four-leaf clover is thought to bring good luck to the finder. This belief dates back to folklore and legends from various cultures, and it is likely that it stemmed from the simple rarity of the clover. With an estimated frequency of occurrence being 1 in 10,000, finding a four-leaf clover is quite rare, and thus, it became linked with good luck. Although it's not entirely clear as to when the concept of four-leaf clovers bringing good luck started, there have been several compelling instances traced back to historical documents. From being referenced as \\"fower-leafed or purple grasse\\" in 1640, kept in gardens for its alleged health benefits, to descriptions from 1869 where it was said to be gathered during the full moon by sorceresses, the four-leaf clover has a rich history embedded in our culture. One of the first explicit references to luck being tied to the four-leaf clover comes from an 11-year-old girl's 1877 letter to St. Nicholas Magazine. So, yes, four-leaf clovers are real, with a rare occurrence making them unique and quite special. Their association with good luck and various other folklore stories have contributed to their exalted status in popular culture. Today, they are often reproduced as symbols or motifs used in a wide array of merchandise and media, particularly around St. Patrick's Day, enforcing the popular belief of them being harbingers of good luck."},{"question":"Access to the underground workings at the La Camorra mine is via a ramp from the surface, excavated at a -15% grade and connecting numerous levels.

Available choices: +yes +it is not possible to tell +no","response":"No, based on the premise \\"But it was the adventure of Garibaldi's Red Shirts that imposed the unification of the peninsula in 1860.\\", we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Garibaldi's Red Shirts divided the peninsula.\\" is true. In fact, the premise implies the opposite of the hypothesis. The adventure of Garibaldi's Red Shirts, also known as the Expedition of the Thousand, was a military campaign led by Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1860 aimed at unifying the Italian peninsula under a single, centralized government. Garibaldi and his followers, called the Red Shirts due to their red uniforms, played a significant role in the process known as the Italian Unification or Risorgimento. The Red Shirts along with various political and social forces in Italy sought to reduce the power of the foreign rulers and the Papacy in the peninsula and create a unified, sovereign Italian state. Before the unification, the Italian peninsula was divided into numerous states, including the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Papal States, and several smaller kingdoms and duchies. Garibaldi's Red Shirts successfully launched an expedition in 1860, starting with the invasion of Sicily and then the conquest of Naples. In both cases, the Red Shirts were able to overthrow the ruling Bourbon monarchs and gain control over these territories. As a result, the southern territories were annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia, paving the way for the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. The subsequent unification of Italy, which included territorial acquisitions and the transfer of power from foreign rulers to a central Italian government, can be attributed in part to the efforts of Garibaldi and his Red Shirts. They were not dividing the peninsula, but instead aiming to create a cohesive and unified Italy. In conclusion, the premise suggests that Garibaldi's Red Shirts were instrumental in the unification of the Italian peninsula in 1860 rather than dividing it. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"Garibaldi's Red Shirts divided the peninsula.\\" is not true, and the correct answer is “no.”"},{"question":"Given the question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

In this case, it is likely that Wal-Mart is faced with accusations of treating their male and female employees differently in ways that are prejudicial to one group. Such lawsuits can have serious consequences for businesses, both financially and reputationally. Firms may be required to pay damages to impacted employees and may face scrutiny from the media, shareholders, and the wider public. Moreover, such lawsuits can lead to changes in business practices and policies to ensure greater equality between male and female employees in the future. For Wal-Mart, facing a \\"huge\\" sex discrimination lawsuit suggests that the company may be dealing with a substantial challenge that could have considerable implications for its future performance and public image. In such cases, it is critical for businesses to address the allegations and make any necessary changes to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws and the fair treatment of employees regardless of their sex. To summarize, based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it can be concluded that Wal-Mart is indeed facing a sex discrimination lawsuit. This type of legal challenge can have significant consequences for the company, both in terms of financial penalties and potential damage to its reputation. Ultimately, it highlights the importance of businesses ensuring they treat all employees equitably and fairly, regardless of their sex, to avoid such legal issues and maintain a positive public image."},{"question":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: It is eight o'clock.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: When will the tax plan be made law?

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him. But many researchers, especially at the start of their careers, don’t... Why isn't achieving impact easy? - impact requires people to have perseverance - impact requires many people - not enough information - Impact requires access The answer is:","response":"Achieving impact is not easy for multiple reasons: 1. Perseverance: Impactful research requires sustained effort and commitment. Researchers need to invest time and resources in building relationships, presenting their work at conferences, and publishing their findings in reputable journals. Perseverance is crucial as the process of creating an impact from research may involve facing numerous challenges and setbacks. 2. Collaboration: Impactful research often relies on the contributions of a diverse range of individuals and organizations. Researchers who collaborate with others in their field or work with various stakeholders, such as government agencies or non-profit organizations, have a higher likelihood of achieving impact. Collaboration helps in maximizing the reach and relevance of the research. 3. Limited information: The early stages of a researcher's career often lack the experience and resources necessary to understand the intricacies of creating impactful research. This may include having a limited network or insufficient knowledge about the best strategies to ensure that their research is communicated effectively. 4. Access: Gaining access to relevant individuals, organizations, and opportunities is a vital part of achieving research impact. Well-established researchers often have more connections and opportunities to spread their research findings. Early-career researchers may struggle to develop these connections, which can make it challenging to gain visibility for their work and contribute to policy or practice change. 5. Fragmented pathways to impact: For some disciplines, such as social and political sciences, the route to achieving impact is more complex and fragmented than in fields like medicine or technology. Impact in these areas may be achieved through a wide range of activities, such as briefings, committee work, networking, and media coverage. This complexity can make it difficult to pinpoint and measure impact. Overall, creating an impact requires a combination of perseverance, collaboration, knowledge, access, and navigating the unique pathways specific to various disciplines. Early-career researchers can face substantial challenges in achieving impact, as they may lack the experience, networks, and resources necessary for success. However, with time and dedication, researchers can develop the skills and connections to create a lasting impact from their work."},{"question":"Q:Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels...

At the end of the year, Pam withdrew 250. If her current balance is 950, how much did she have in the bank account at the beginning of the year? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To solve this problem, we'll work backwards from the information given. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. Pam's current balance is 950 after withdrawing 250. This means her balance before the withdrawal was 950 + 250 = 1200. 2. Since her balance tripled during the year, we need to find out the original amount (the balance at the beginning of the year). To do this, we'll divide the balance before the withdrawal (1200) by 3 (the factor by which it increased). 3. 1200 ÷ 3 = 400.

She served as the head coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team from 1974 to 2012, before retiring at age 59 because of a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She won eight NCAA championships (a NCAA women's record when she retired) and the third most all time. Summitt won a silver medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal as a member of the United States women's national basketball team. Summitt was born Patricia Sue Head on June 14, 1952 in Clarksville, Tennessee, the daughter of Richard and Hazel Albright Head. In her early years, she was known as Trish. She had four siblings: older brothers Tommy, Charles, and Kenneth, and a younger sister, Linda. She married Ross Barnes Summitt II in 1980 from whom she filed for divorce in 2007. They have one son, Ross Tyler Summitt, born in 1990. When Summitt was in high school, her family moved to nearby Henrietta, so she could play basketball in Cheatham County because Clarksville did not have a girls team. From there, Summitt went to University of Tennessee at Martin where she was a member of Chi Omega Sorority and won All-American honors, playing for UT-Martin's first women's basketball coach, Nadine Gearin. In 1970, with the passage of Title IX still two years away, there were no athletic scholarships for women. Each of Summitt's brothers had gotten an athletic scholarship, but her parents had to pay her way to college. She later co-captained the United States women's national basketball team as a player at the inaugural women's tournament in the 1976 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal. Eight years later in 1984, she coached the U.S. women's team to an Olympic gold medal, becoming the first U.S. Olympian to win a basketball medal and coach a medal-winning team.

Taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. In a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. Fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. The growing root tip is protected by a root cap. The root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). Root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. In some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots. Q: What is the growing root tip protected by? A: Answer:","response":"The growing root tip is protected by a root cap."},{"question":"I regularly take the train and have not encountered any particular difficulties at border crossings.

Despite the Lions getting the opening score of the first quarter with a 46-yard field goal from kicker Jason Hanson, Pittsburgh would answer with running back Rashard Mendenhall's 7-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Detroit closed out the opening period with Hanson making another 46-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Steelers would deliver a big strike with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller. Even though the Lions came right back with cornerback Williams James returning an interception 38&#160;yards for a touchdown, Pittsburgh effectively replied with Roethlisberger's 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward. In the third quarter, the Steelers would add onto their lead as Roethlisberger threw to rookie wide receiver Mike Wallace on a 47-yard touchdown pass. Detroit tried to rally in the fourth quarter as quarterback Daunte Culpepper found wide receiver Dennis Northcutt on a 25-yard touchdown pass, but Pittsburgh's defense made a crucial stand with three-straight sacks (courtesy of linebacker LaMarr Woodley, cornerback William Gay, and linebacker Lawrence Timmons), followed by cornerback Ike Taylor swatting away the Lions' last hope from a hail-mary pass.

I am not here to blindly follow your orders or bend to your whims.\\" His voice was steady, a testament to the inner strength that had brought him to this pivotal moment. The elvin leader, a tall and elegant figure with piercing green eyes, stepped forward, her silken robes flowing gracefully around her slender form. \\"And what reason do you have to defy us?\\" she asked, her voice as smooth as honey yet tinged with an unmistakable hint of irritation. \\"Why should you place your interests above those of the greater good?\\" Cutter took a deep breath, knowing that the weight of his next words would determine not only the course of his own life but possibly the fate of everyone around him. \\"Because I believe that there's a better way.\\" He paused briefly, allowing the significance of his statement to sink in. \\"A way to unite us all, despite our differences, rather than forcing us into a conflict that will bring nothing but destruction and despair.\\" The assembled beings exchanged glances, and an uneasy silence fell upon the gathering. Some looked at Cutter with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism, while others appeared openly hostile, as if they couldn't fathom the idea of challenging the established order of things. But there was also a small group who looked at him with hope, eager to hear more about his proposal for unity and peace. The elvin leader studied Cutter for a moment, her expression inscrutable. \\"Tell us more of this 'better way,' human,\\" she finally said, her tone suggesting that she was at least willing to give him a chance to explain himself. Cutter nodded, his resolution reinforced by the encouragement he saw in some of the faces in the crowd. \\"We've all been taught to fear and mistrust each other, based on our species and our magical abilities,\\" he began, his voice filled with passion. \\"But we are more than our labels and our powers – and we have the capacity to understand and accept one another if we're willing to try. Instead of forcing us into a position where we feel threatened and are compelled to fight, we should be fostering communication and trust.\\" His eyes swept over the assembled beings, as if trying to reach every single one of them in turn. \\"Together, we are stronger than we could ever be apart. But only if we can find a way to set aside the prejudices that have been ingrained in us and embrace each other as allies and friends.\\" Cutter paused, his words hanging in the air, leaving an indelible impact on those who listened. \\"I propose that we form a council – a group of representatives from each species and magical group – who will work together to find solutions to the problems that face us all and create a more peaceful and just world for everyone.\\" The elvin leader looked thoughtful, her gaze locked onto Cutter's face as she considered his words.

There are 20 episodes and they are each 30 minutes long. How many hours does he have to watch a day? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To determine how many hours John needs to watch per day, we first need to calculate the total time required to watch all episodes and then divide that by the number of days. Total time = number of episodes × length per episode Total time = 20 episodes × 30 minutes Total time = 600 minutes Now, we need to convert the minutes into hours. 600 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours Since John wants to finish watching the show in 5 days, we divide the total hours by the number of days.

Answer:","response":"If more evaporation occurs, it could lead to a reduction in the amount of water available to enter the cracks in rocks. This may result in a decrease in the frequency or intensity of freeze-thaw cycles, as there would be less water to freeze into ice and cause the cracks to expand. Consequently, this could lead to slower weathering and a reduction in the rate at which rocks split into smaller pieces. So, the supposed perturbation would have an indirect effect on the process, potentially leading to slower weathering."},{"question":"Here is a dialogue: Jenny: hi Jenny: beer today? Jenny: or vodka?

The Slaters of Wolverhampton are plagued with Mrs. Slater's chronic debilitating asthma and her cooking limited to what comes in canned goods that she can heat in boiling water.

In this context, it has been argued that the phrase \\"all lives matter\\" undermines the focus on the unique challenges faced by black people and serves to diminish the central message of the original movement.

Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts. I was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning. I spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her: “What do you know about Machiavellianism?” I swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose.

Answer:","response":"Title: Absolute Nightmare - Avoid at All Costs! Review: I don't even know where to begin with this abysmal app called com.google.android.marvin.talkback. Giving it one star is a generous act on my part, as I would have gone into negative numbers if that were possible. To say that my experience with this app has been frustrating would be an understatement. First of all, installing the app was a tremendous headache. The download process took ages, and once it finally installed, it consumed a massive amount of space on my device. In all honesty, I've never seen such a big app with so little to offer. Additionally, the constant app crashes were infuriating, forcing me to restart my device multiple times. Speaking of its features, the functionality of this app is supposed to assist users with visual impairments, but it is far from user-friendly. The app's interface is confusing and poorly designed. One would expect an accessibility app to be simple and easy to navigate for its target audience, but this app is the polar opposite. Accessibility features are buried under layers of confusing settings and options, making it almost impossible to enable or customize them. The text-to-speech feature, meant to aid visually impaired users, only adds to the frustration. The robotic voice is unbearable and often difficult to understand. Furthermore, the app consistently mispronounces words and fails to detect punctuation correctly. Users who rely on this feature for communication or navigation will find it utterly disappointing and unhelpful. The talkback feature is equally flawed. With the app's inability to detect certain buttons, users end up tapping items several times while the feature provides no feedback. As a result, any blind or visually impaired user would find the app a significant hindrance than an aid. To add to its many shortcomings, the app is ridden with bugs and lags, making it impossible to properly appreciate any of the other app features. It has drained my battery life significantly, to the point that my phone is virtually useless within hours. To make matters worse, the customer support is a joke. When I tried to reach out with inquiries and bug reports, all I received were generic and unhelpful responses. In conclusion, the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app is an absolute disaster and a disgrace to the app ecosystem. As a product developed by a leading technology company, I expected so much better. I strictly advise users with visual impairments to search for alternative accessibility apps. I implore the developers to either overhaul the app entirely or remove it from the app store, as it does more harm than good for its target audience. For those contemplating downloading this app, spare yourself the trouble. The com.google.android.marvin.talkback app is not worth the time, energy, or precious storage space."},{"question":"Here's a question: James sat down and looked at the menu, then he placed an order. Where might he be? Here are possible answers to this question: - shop - cafe - internet sites - table - advertisement I believe the correct choice is \\"cafe\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","response":"James is most likely at a cafe. Let's analyze each of the possible answers and understand why \\"cafe\\" is the most appropriate choice. 1. Shop: While it is possible that some shops may have menus, it is quite rare, and a shop is more focused on selling merchandise rather than taking food orders. In addition, one typically does not sit down to order and consume food at a shop. 2. Cafe: A cafe is an establishment where customers can usually sit down, look through a menu, and order food or beverages. This scenario aligns perfectly with the information provided about James sitting down and looking at the menu before placing an order. Thus, it is highly probable that James is at a cafe. 3. Internet sites: Internet sites can be used to browse menus and place orders for food or beverages. However, the provided information mentions that James physically sits down and looks at a menu, which does not correspond to the online experience. Therefore, it is unlikely that James is on an internet site. 4. Table: The mention of James sitting down and looking at a menu suggests that he is indeed at a table. Nevertheless, the prompt asks for a suitable location, and \\"table\\" serves more as an object found in specific locations. Therefore, while \\"table\\" is connected to the experience, it does not provide the complete context. 5. Advertisement: Advertisements can showcase menus and available food options. However, the act of sitting down, looking through a menu, and placing an order is not directly connected to an advertisement.

Context: Apologies again that it’s been a while since I last posted. You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Would \\"The term \\"blended malt\\" replaced \\"vatted malt\\" used under the prior labelling conventions.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: (1). No (2). Yes Answer:","response":"(1). No The production process of single malt scotch is quite distinct from the concept of blended malt, and the change in labeling terminology does not provide an exhaustive understanding of how single malt scotch is made. To provide a detailed answer on how single malt scotch is made, here is a step-by-step guide to the production process: 1. Malting: The process starts with malting, where barley grains are soaked in water for a few days to stimulate germination and convert starch into fermentable sugars. The germinated barley, now referred to as \\"malt,\\" is then dried using hot air or traditionally, over a peat fire which gives the final product a distinct smoky flavor. 2. Milling: The dried malt is then sent to a mill, where it is ground into a coarse powder called \\"grist.\\" This process helps to break down the malt's fibrous husk and expose the sugar-rich content inside. 3. Mashing: The grist is then mixed with hot water in a large container called a \\"mash tun.\\" This process extracts fermentable sugars from the malt and creates a sweet liquid known as \\"wort.\\" The wort is then drained from the mash tun, leaving behind the spent grains. 4. Fermentation: The wort is transferred to a fermentation vessel, usually made of steel or wood, where yeast is added. The yeast feeds on the sugars in the wort and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation usually takes about 48-96 hours, resulting in a liquid called \\"wash\\" with an alcohol content of about 7-8%. 5. Distillation: The wash is then distilled in copper pot stills, which help to remove impurities and concentrate the flavors. Single malt scotch undergoes a double distillation process. First, the wash is heated in a \\"wash still,\\" where the lightest and most volatile compounds evaporate, leaving behind heavier compounds in the form of \\"pot ale.\\" The evaporated vapors are then cooled and condensed into a liquid called \\"low wines,\\" with an alcohol content of about 20-25%. The low wines are then distilled again in a \\"spirit still,\\" further increasing the alcohol content and refining the flavors. 6. Maturation: The distilled spirit is transferred to oak casks, where it is aged for a minimum of three years. The casks may have previously held bourbon, sherry, or wine, which can impart unique flavors and characteristics to the final product. As the spirit ages, it interacts with the wood, developing its color, taste, and aroma. The angel's share, the portion of the whisky that evaporates during maturation, also contributes to the final flavor profile. 7. Bottling: Once the scotch has been aged to the desired maturity, it is bottled at its final strength, typically between 40-46% alcohol by volume (ABV). In conclusion, the production process of single malt scotch encompasses several steps, including malting, milling, mashing, fermentation, distillation, maturation, and bottling. \\"The term \\"blended malt\\" replaced \\"vatted malt\\" used under the prior labeling conventions\\" would not be a reasonable description of how single malt scotch is made as it pertains to a different category of scotch whisky altogether that involves blending multiple single malts from different distilleries."},{"question":"What happens next in this paragraph?

To answer this question, I will research materials that can resist or block magnetic fields. Step 1: Research materials that resist magnetic fields I found that certain materials called \\"mu-metals\\" and \\"superconductors\\" can resist or alter magnetic field lines. Mu-metals are made of nickel, iron, and small amounts of other metals, and they can effectively redirect magnetic field lines. Superconductors, when cooled to near-absolute zero, can repel magnetic fields due to the Meissner effect. Conclusion for the first question: Yes, there are materials like mu-metals and superconductors that can resist magnetic field lines. Second question: Is there any material to restrict magnetic field? To answer this question, I will search for materials that can limit or confine magnetic fields. Step 1: Research materials that restrict magnetic fields During the research, I found that the same materials mentioned earlier, mu-metals and superconductors, can also help restrict or confine magnetic fields.

Graham (R-S.C.) said Monday that he will block every one of President Obama's nominees on the Senate floor until the administration discloses information about the survivors of last year's attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Where are the #Benghazi survivors? I'm going to block every appointment in the US Senate until they are made available to Congress. — Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) October 28, 2013 Graham's comments came the morning after CBS's \\"60 Minutes\\" aired a report Sunday night featuring a rare eyewitness to the attack — a former British soldier who used a pseudonym. One of the four Americans killed during the attack was the U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens. Graham, a top critic of the administration's handling of the killings of four Americans in Benghazi, has accused the administration of telling the survivors not to talk about their experience. Of the several dozen surviving diplomatic and security officials who were in Benghazi the night of the attack, all but one has returned to work in ongoing assignments. The State Department has said repeatedly that any non-security official who wants to talk to Congress about the experience is free to do so, but has protested, along with the Justice Department, attempts by congressional Republicans to subpoena security officials on grounds that it could compromise any testimony they might give at any future prosecution of the perpetrators. Despite written administration appeals, Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee subpoenaed two Diplomatic Security officials — one who was in Benghazi and another who was in Tripoli, the Libyan capital — who provided closed-door depositions to the committee this month. Graham has previously threatened to block specific nominees while seeking information on Benghazi. A spokesman noted that Graham briefly blocked the nomination of John Brennan to serve as the next CIA director until the White House acknowledged that President Obama did not call anyone in Libya the night of the raid but spoke with the Libyan president the day after. Graham’s announcement comes on the same day that the Senate is scheduled to hold a vote to confirm Richard Griffin as the top lawyer at the National Labor Relations Board and as Senate Democrats are expected to hold votes soon on several nominees to federal judgeships, including picks to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Holding up votes on any position at the NLRB would be notable, because the White House withdrew the names of several picks this summer as part of a bipartisan deal to move forward with a series of confirmation votes and maintain the current rules of the Senate.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"No, these questions are not the same. They represent different scenarios and goals. Let's analyze each question and explain the differences between them. Question 1: \\"I am doing a BS in physics. Will I be able to get into an engineering school for a master's?\\" This question revolves around the possibility of a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics to get into an engineering school for a Master's degree. The focus of the question is on the transition from Physics to Engineering and the eligibility for graduate studies in an Engineering school. Question 2: \\"I am doing my master's in physics. I want to pursue I.A.S. in my career. How should I go forward?\\" In this question, the person is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Physics and aims to pursue I.A.S. (Indian Administrative Service) as their career path. The focus here is on how to proceed towards a career in the Indian Administrative Service after completing a Master's in Physics. While both questions involve academic pursuits in Physics, the goals, and contexts are quite different.

The book, which enjoyed immense popularity in the years before World War I, is an early example of the espionage novel and was extremely influential in the genre of spy fiction. It has been made into feature-length films for both cinema and television. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established as a sovereign state on 1 January 1801 by the Acts of Union 1800, which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The growing desire for an Irish Republic led to the Irish War of Independence, which resulted in Ireland seceding from the Union and forming the Irish Free State in 1922. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, and the state was consequently renamed the \\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\". - The Anglo-Irish Treaty, commonly known as The Treaty and officially the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty Between Great Britain and Ireland, was an agreement between the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and representatives of the Irish Republic that concluded the Irish War of Independence. It provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State within a year as a self-governing dominion within the 'community of nations known as the British Empire', a status 'the same as that of the Dominion of Canada'. It also provided Northern Ireland, which had been created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, an option to opt out of the Irish Free State, which it exercised. - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - Robert Childers Barton ( 4 March 1881 -- 10 August 1975 ) was an Irish nationalist , politician and farmer who participated in the negotiations leading up to the signature of the Anglo - Irish Treaty . His father was Charles William Barton and his mother was Agnes Childers . His wife was Rachel Warren of Boston , daughter of Fiske Warren . His double first cousin and close friend was Robert Erskine Childers . - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - The Irish Free State (; 6 December 192229 December 1937) was an independent state established in 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921. That treaty ended the three-year Irish War of Independence between the forces of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and British Crown forces. - The Irish War of Independence or Anglo-Irish War or the Tan War was a guerrilla war fought from 1919 to 1921 between the Irish Republican Army (IRA, the army of the Irish Republic) and the British security forces in Ireland. It was an escalation of the Irish revolutionary period into armed conflict. - Robert Erskine Childers DSC (25 June 1870 24 November 1922), universally known as Erskine Childers, was the author of the influential novel \\"The Riddle of the Sands\\" and an Irish nationalist who smuggled guns to Ireland in his sailing yacht \\"Asgard\\". He was executed by the authorities of the nascent Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. He was the son of British Orientalist scholar Robert Caesar Childers; the cousin of Hugh Childers and Robert Barton; and the father of the fourth President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Context: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

This memo is necessary only because we seem not to understand that coal pays the bills.\\" Those are the words of Massey Energy ( MEE - news - people ) President and CEO Don Blankenship in an Oct. 19, 2005, memorandum to his deep mine superintendents. This, according to a complaint by Delorice Bragg and Freda Hatfield on behalf of their deceased miner husbands, who died in a fire in the Aracoma Alma No. 1 Mine in Logan County, W.Va. This suit alleges that Blankenship was \\"demanding that the mine operators forego activities (such as safety projects) that did not add to corporate profit.\\" That complaint points to this memo as \\"a direct and proximate cause of the unsafe workplace conditions that led to [these miners'] deaths.\\" Massey settled the Aracoma suits by paying a civil fine of 1.7 million and an additional 2.5 million in fines for criminal violations, according to U.S. District Court in Charleston documents. Flash forward to April 5, 2010, when 25 miners were killed (four are presently unaccounted for) in the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, W.Va. According to a company statement, Massey Energy will pay for the funeral costs of the deceased UBB miners. The average American funeral costs 6,195, according to the National Funeral Directors Association's 2006 General Price List Survey. And that price doesn't even include a tombstone, flowers or obituary. For those 25 miners, the funerals would cost about 154,875. Massey's Upper Big Branch Mine South received 197 citations from the Mine Safety & Health Administration for various unsafe mine conditions. Forty-nine of those citations are still being contested and three of them were deemed non-assessable. Massey's 144 paid citations came up to 47,661, according to an MSHA database. The contested citations would have added 73,513 to the 47,661, making for a total 121,174 in citation fees. UBB had 515 citations in 2009, according to an MSHA database. There are unionized and non-unionized mines; UBB was not unionized, according to Phil Smith, spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America. He adds that the number of citations is typically higher at unionized mines because workers are more freely able to point out dangerous conditions. The latest press statement by Massey Energy states that, \\"Since January 2009 UBB has had less than one violation per day of inspection by MSHA, a rate consistent with national averages. Most of the citations issued by MSHA to UBB in the last year were resolved on the same day they were issued.\\" From 2008 to 2009 \\"the Upper Big Branch mine had 500 violations, including 50 very serious 'unwarrantable failures.' Massey tripled its production in the mines,\\" says Jeff Biggers, author of Reckoning at Eagle Creek: The Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland. Summary:","response":"In 2005, Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship allegedly urged mine superintendents to prioritize coal production over safety projects, as indicated in a memorandum. This memo was cited as a significant cause of unsafe working conditions leading to miner deaths. Massey Energy settled related lawsuits by paying a 1.7 million civil fine and an additional 2.5 million for criminal violations. The company's Upper Big Branch mine, which experienced a fatal explosion killing 25 miners in 2010, received 197 citations for unsafe mine conditions. The mine had 515 citations in 2009 and saw a significant increase in both violations and production from 2008 to 2009."},{"question":"How is \\"Yes, if we do not say at the same time that solidarity forces us to create an opportunity to protect the euro with eurobonds to invest, to continue to make the ecological and economic transformation.\\" said in Romanian?","response":"Sigur, dacă nu spunem în același timp că solidaritatea ne obligă să creăm o oportunitate de a proteja euro cu euroobligațiuni pentru a investi, pentru a continua să facem transformarea ecologică și economică.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"The two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question addresses the amount of water lost through breathing, while the second question explores ways to increase daily water consumption. To provide detailed answers to both questions, let's address each separately. 1. How much water does a person lose in a day through breathing? Water loss through breathing is known as insensible water loss and occurs as the body exhales humidified air. The amount of water lost through breathing depends on several factors, including the temperature, humidity level in the environment, and an individual's breathing rate. On average, though, a person loses about 300 to 500 milliliters (approximately 10 to 17 fluid ounces) of water per day through breathing. Factors affecting water loss through breathing include: - Physical activity: Exercise increases the breathing rate, which can lead to increased water loss. - Environmental conditions: Dry air can cause more significant water loss as the air inhaled is humidified to saturation by the body before being exhaled. - Metabolic rate: Water loss through breathing can vary with the metabolic rate, which can fluctuate depending on factors such as diet, age, and overall health. It's essential to replenish the water lost through breathing and other processes by maintaining adequate hydration to ensure the body's proper functioning. 2. How do you drink more water every day? Drinking sufficient water daily helps maintain overall health and bodily functions. Here are some tips for increasing your daily water intake: - Carry a water bottle: Keep a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day to make it easier to drink water wherever you go. - Set reminders: Use your phone, smartwatch, or an app to set reminders to drink water at regular intervals, ensuring you stay on track. - Infuse your water with flavor: Adding fruit, vegetables, or herbs (e.g., lemon, cucumber, or mint) may make it more appealing and help you drink more. - Drink before meals: Drinking a glass of water before meals can help curb appetite and increase water consumption. - Replace other beverages: Replace sugary drinks, soda, and alcohol with water to reduce calorie intake and increase hydration levels. - Use a marked water bottle: Choose a water bottle with measurements on the side to track your daily water consumption easily. - Opt for water-rich foods: Consuming foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables, can contribute to your daily water intake. - Establish a routine: Drink water at specific times of the day, such as after waking up, before a workout, or during breaks at work, to create a consistent habit. Remember, individual water needs might vary depending on factors such as age, body weight, sex, activity level, and climate. It's essential to pay attention to your body's thirst cues and adjust your water intake accordingly for optimal health."},{"question":"- relatives is jeffery dench -lrb- brother -rrb- - years active is 1957 -- present - caption is dench at the baftas , february 2007 - honorific suffix is ch dbe frsa - birth name is judith olivia dench - spouse is michael -rrb- williams -lrb- 1971 -- 2001 ; his death - children is finty williams - birth date is 9 december 1934 - image is judi dench at the baftas 2007.jpg - birth place is heworth , york , england - religion is religious society of friends - alma mater is central school of speech and drama - occupation is actress , author Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

These terms are used to describe a group or gathering of lapwings, which are medium-sized wading birds belonging to the family Vanellinae, in the larger Charadriiformes order. Lapwings are found across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and are characterized by their distinctive crests and rounded wings. The term \\"deceit\\" is used as a collective noun for lapwings due to their unique behavior when protecting their nests and offspring from potential threats. Lapwings are known for being clever and resourceful when it comes to warding off predators. They employ a tactic known as \\"injury feigning\\" or \\"brood distraction\\" where the adult bird will pretend to be injured, drawing the predator's attention away from their nest or chicks, thus deceiving the predator into thinking they have an easy catch. Once the threat is lured away from the nest, the lapwing suddenly \\"recovers\\" and flies off to safety. This cunning behavior of lapwings has earned them the collective noun \\"deceit.\\" On the other hand, the term \\"lap\\" is derived from the Old English word \\"hlȳp\\" or \\"hlǣp,\\" which means to run or jump hurriedly. This relates to the way lapwings move when they are on the ground, quickly running and jumping to catch prey like insects and worms. With the graceful, agile movements and the repetitive flaps of the wings they make while flying, their collective behavior appears like they are taking \\"laps\\" on the ground or in the air. There are several species of lapwings with distinct features and habitats, such as: 1. Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus): Found throughout Europe and Asia, the northern lapwing is easily identified by its sleek black and white plumage, green iridescent back feathers, and long crest. 2. Red-wattled lapwing (Vanellus indicus): Known for its unique red wattles located near its eyes, the red-wattled lapwing is a common sight across South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Northern Africa. 3. Spur-winged lapwing (Vanellus spinosus): Native to Africa and the Middle East, the spur-winged lapwing gets its name from the spur located on the edge of its wings, which it uses for defense and in territorial disputes. 4. Masked lapwing (Vanellus miles): Found in Australia, New Guinea, and the surrounding islands, the masked lapwing is characterized by its striking yellow facial wattles and black and white plumage. Apart from their fascinating behavior and appearance, lapwings are also known for their distinct vocalizations. Calls range from melodious, plaintive cries to harsh, metallic notes, which they use to communicate with each other and for defending their territory. In conclusion, the collective noun for lapwings is a deceit or a lap of lapwings, referring to their cunning behavior and agile movements, respectively. These intriguing birds boast characteristic appearances and exhibit fascinating behaviors that make them stand out in the diverse world of avian species."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"I will now write a sentence in Spanish, as it is a widely spoken language that is also known by many non-English speakers.

(CNN) -- Its name means \\"bending over in pain.\\" It has no treatment or vaccine. Its symptoms resemble Dengue fever. And it has infected more than 1 million people -- 155 of them fatally -- since spreading to the Americas one year ago. The mosquito-borne Chikungunya virus has long been diagnosed in travelers returning from countries in Asia and Africa, where the disease is widespread. But in December 2013, the first people infected by mosquitoes local to the region were reported on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. This was the first outbreak of the debilitating disease in the Western Hemisphere, health officials said. All countries in Central America have now reported local transmission of Chikungunya [pronounced chik-un-GOON-ya], and the United States had 11 confirmed cases of local infection this year as of December 12, all in Florida. There also have been 1,900 imported cases across the United States in returning travelers. \\"It wasn't until 2013 that unfortunately a traveler resulted in local transmission of Chikungunya,\\" said Erin Staples of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), referring to the people infected in Saint Martin. Those infected carry the virus in their bloodstream; it can then be picked up by mosquitoes as they bite, making them carriers. The virus has since spread rapidly and shows no signs of leaving, as ecological conditions are perfect for the disease to flourish. \\"We knew it would spread,\\" said Staples, a medical epidemiologist. The big question perplexing officials: Why now? Global rise in Chikungunya infections Global rise in Chikungunya infections Global rise in Chikungunya infections Global rise in Chikungunya infections Global rise in Chikungunya infections Global rise in Chikungunya infections Global rise in Chikungunya infections Two mosquito species primed to the temperatures of Central and South America carry Chikungunya. The species -- Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus -- also carry the virus behind Dengue fever. \\"Given the level of Dengue in the region, we knew there could be the same levels of Chikungunya,\\" Staples said. Both diseases can cause joint pain and inflammation, headaches, rashes and fever, and can lead to death in rare cases. But this tropical disease with an exotic name (which originates from the African Makonde dialect) causes more intense joint pain and inflammation. For some people the pain can last for months or years, resulting in additional psychological strain. The lack of immunity among people living in the Americas provided a blank canvas for Chikungunya to spread throughout the population this year. As of December 12, more than 1.03 million people have been infected, in addition to the 155 who died, according to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). Almost all of the fatalities occurred in the Caribbean island countries of Guadeloupe and Martinique. We have minimal to no immunity as people haven't seen Chikungunya before.Dr. Erin Staples, CDC \\"Where we saw the biggest jump was after it reached the Spanish-speaking countries in the region,\\" said Staples, referring to the weakened infrastructures and health systems of countries such as the Dominican Republic, which has reported more than 520,000 cases -- more than half of the overall outbreak and 5% of the island country's population. As South American countries approach their summer, numbers are expected to rise there as the mosquitoes flourish in the heat. \\"Brazil, Peru, Paraguay are coming into their summer months and reporting their first local transmission,\\" Staples said. Already, more than 2,000 people have been infected in Brazil. Is there cause for concern? Because infection with Chikungunya is rarely fatal, the issue of most concern to officials is the burden on health services and the impact of the debilitating symptoms on the economy. \\"The high number of cases can overload health services,\\" says Dr. Pilar Ramon-Pardo, regional adviser for PAHO, the regional office of the World Health Organization. Until recently, monitoring for Chikungunya was not part of routine surveillance in the region. \\"Clinicians have to be ready to diagnose,\\" she said About 20% to 30% of cases are expected to become chronic, with symptoms such as arthritis and other rheumatic manifestations leading to physical disabilities, Ramon-Pardo said. Further long-term effects are psychological as people become more depressed and tired. All of this can result in missed work and lower school attendance, she said, hurting local economies. Is it here to stay? The warm climate of the region offers potential for Chikungunya levels to be maintained for years to come, just like Dengue fever. But areas of most concern are the tropics. The high number of cases can overload health servicesDr. Pilar Ramon-Pardo, PAHO \\"The areas which have year-round favorable climate for the mosquito are at the greatest risk,\\" says Dr. Laith Yakob of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which is monitoring the spread of the outbreak. While the climate and mosquitos have long been present, Ramon-Pardo said, \\"we don't know why this is happening now.\\" She said globalization is likely to blame, with increased population movement from one country to another. This offers more opportunities for local mosquitos to bite infected humans. The CDC's Staples said she is temporarily at ease regarding numbers in the U.S. \\"We're moving into fall and winter periods, which should see activity decrease,\\" she said. Cold temperatures reduce mosquito survival rates. The rapid spread of Chikungunya this year also could help minimize future infections. \\"Chikungunya will go through a region quite rapidly and create a level of population immunity which helps mitigate large outbreaks of the disease,\\" Staples said. Unlike Dengue, infection with Chikungunya results in lifelong immunity. Like many other infections, Chikungunya could, however, remain in the background through animals capable of carrying the virus in their bloodstream and acting as so-called reservoirs of the disease. \\"In Asia and Africa there is a transmission cycle in small mammals and monkeys,\\" Ramon-Pardo said, meaning these animals keep the virus present within the population. \\"In the Americas ... we don't know yet.\\" Those words -- \\"we don't know\\" -- resonate throughout the community of scientists and government officials trying to control the outbreak. The future risk of spread, levels of future immunity, risk from animal reservoirs, why this is only happening now, and the total economic impact are all unknown. \\"Mathematical models are under construction by numerous research groups around the world to improve confidence over projections of future spread,\\" said Yakob, whose team is modeling the disease. As they work, control efforts continue. When it comes to controlling Chikungunya, there are two main strategies -- reduce the likelihood of bites and remove the ever-biting mosquito. Prevention is the priority. There are a lot of questions. Only time will tell what we'll seeDr. Erin Staples, CDC Unlike the mosquitoes behind malaria, which bite at night, the species behind Chikungunya bite any time, day or night. Those living in affected areas are asked to use repellent, sleep under bed nets and wear long clothing to avoid getting bitten. The air conditioned and indoor environments of people living in the U.S. mean numbers are likely to stay low there. But mosquito control is at the heart of it all. Mass spraying of insecticides and removal of any sources of shallow water in which mosquitoes can breed are taking place across the continents. According to the CDC's Staples, Florida has been highly aggressive with its approach to control. \\"We're only at 11 (cases) due to such proactive measures,\\" Staples said. For now, prevention is all they have as officials wait and see how the outbreak pans out. \\"There is no vaccine currently and no good antivirals, so we are trying to control the spread of the disease,\\" Staples said. \\"There are a lot of questions and only time will tell what we'll see for Chikungunya in the future.\\" Debilitating case of mosquito-borne chikungunya in U.S. Mosquito-borne virus chikungunya worries CDC What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"There is a sickness called Chikungunya that is making many people in the Americas, especially in Central America, feel very sick.

The hypothesis suggests a direct result of Jimmy Johnson buying the team and them doing a lot better. Step 2: Comparing the two: The premise tells us that \\"it was bad\\" when Jimmy Johnson took over and made his decisions, which seemingly conflicts with the result suggested by the hypothesis. Step 3: Analyzing the contradiction: The premise suggests negative outcomes following Jimmy Johnson's involvement, while the hypothesis suggests positive outcomes. Step 4: Conclusions: Given the negative sentiment in the premise versus the positive sentiment in the hypothesis, we can determine that the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

In general they include units that carry or employ a weapon system such as infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. The use of multiple combat arms in mutually supporting ways is known as combined arms. - Cavalry (from French \\"cavalerie\\", cf. \\"cheval\\" 'horse') or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman, dragoon or trooper. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals, such as camels, mules or elephants. Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons, a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title. - Mounted infantry were infantry who rode horses instead of marching, but, as infantry does in general, fought on foot (in the modern era with muskets or rifles, but before that with swords, spears, bows, or crossbows). In contrast, cavalry fought on horseback. The original dragoons were essentially mounted infantry. According to the 1911 \\"Encyclopædia Britannica\\", \\"Mounted rifles are half cavalry, mounted infantry merely specially mobile infantry.\\" Today, with motor vehicles having replaced horses for military transport, the motorized infantry are in some respects successors to mounted infantry. - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among: - Karl von Schmidt ( January 12 , 1817 -- August 25 , 1875 ) was a Prussian cavalry general . Schmidt was born at Schwedt on the Oder in the Province of Brandenburg , and entered the 4th Ulans as a second lieutenant in 1834 . Schmidt 's long regimental service was varied by staff service and instructional work , and in the mobilization of 1859 he had the command of a landwehr cavalry regiment . In 1863 he was made colonel of the 4th Cuirassiers , which he commanded in the , for the cavalry arm , uneventful campaigns in the Second Schleswig War of 1864 and the Austro - Prussian War of 1866 . He then commanded a newly raised regiment of Schleswig - Holstein troops , the 16th Hussars , but at the outbreak of the Franco - Prussian War he was still an obscure and perhaps a mistrusted officer , though his grasp of every detail of cavalry work was admitted . But an opportunity for distinction was grasped in the cavalry fighting around Mars - la - Tour ( August 16 ) , in which he temporarily led a brigade and was severely wounded . He was soon promoted major - general and succecded to the temporary command of his division on the disablement of its leader . In this post Schmidt did brilliant work in the campaign on the Loire , and even in the winter operations towards Le Mans , and earned a reputation second to none amongst the officers and men of his arm . After the war he took a leading part in the reorganization of the Prussian cavalry , which in ten years raised its efficiency to a point far beyond that of any other cavalry in Europe . In 1875 , though his health was failing , he refused to give up the conduct of certain important cavalry manoeuvres with which he had been entrusted . But a few days of heavy work in the field brought on a fatal illness , and he died at Danzig on the 25 August 1875 . In 1889 the 4th Ulans , in which his regimental service was almost entirely spent , were given the name \`\` von Schmidt '' . Schmidt 's drill and maneuvre instructions were codified and published after his death by his... - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - A warrior is a person specializing in combat or warfare, especially within the context of a tribal or clan-based warrior culture society that recognizes a separate warrior class or caste. - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer. What entity does 'karl von schmidt' has the relation 'occupation' with? The answer to this question is:","response":"Karl von Schmidt had the relation 'occupation' with the Prussian cavalry. He was a Prussian cavalry general who served in various capacities, such as regimental service, staff service, and instructional work. He played a significant role in the reorganization of the Prussian cavalry, which eventually led to it becoming one of the most efficient cavalry forces in Europe."},{"question":"Given the question: I read this background article the other day: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. I am facing a new situation today: Two engineering students learned about petroleum products, While Dan learned more about plastics, Jim learned about fuels. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student learned less about fuels for trains? The answer is:","response":"Dan learned less about fuels for trains. This is because Dan focused more on learning about plastics, which are also derived from petroleum products, but not the specific fuels that power vehicles like trains. On the other hand, Jim specifically concentrated on learning about fuels which are more prominently used to power vehicles such as cars, trucks, airplanes, and trains. Therefore, compared to Jim, Dan acquired less knowledge about fuels for trains."},{"question":"I heard that Cameron broke my leg by accident during the big basketball game.

Here’s more Caitlyn: teal hair extensions, (sometimes) makeup-free and emotionally raw. It opens with a very candid Caitlyn. It’s 4:30 a.m., she’s not wearing makeup and she’s feeling a little stressed. “What a responsibility I have to this community,” she sighs with a bit of fear in her voice. “I just hope I get it right” She’s very clear about her role: an educator and an advocate. She turns the mirror a bit away from her and showcases the issues: More murders, exponentially higher rates of suicide, throes of misunderstanding … and no contract with E! to publicly share their stories. Not everyone has that type of platform or the money for new clothes or cosmetic surgeries and she gets that. She just wants help in whatever way she can – for now, that means becoming comfortable with herself. A nervous Caitlyn still needs to meet some of her family: “A very good looking woman” We’ve seen and heard a lot from Caitlyn’s mother, Esther, over the past few months. She was part of that Diane Sawyer interview and she moved everyone to tears at the ESPYs. But here we see her off guard. It was the first time she’s seen her child since Bruce became Caitlyn and the tension was a bit thick. She was coming over, with daughters Lisa and Pam by her side, for her birthday. Hands twitching nervously, Caitlyn greets everyone with a big hello. “I thought you were going to look more like me,” Pam says. Oh Pam, you slay us. Long, flowing locks of teal Daughter Kylie, hoping to surprise Caitlyn, shows up at her house unannounced with a special surprise: teal hair extensions. This is the first time they’re meeting in person and Caitlyn, clad in a fluffy white robe, is shocked to see her. Immediately, she goes in for the sweetest hug. They both go over to see Esther, who’s getting her makeup done. Three generations of women together. Such a small moment, sure, but a very beautiful one. (And, yes, the teal works.)

She’s having a bit more of a difficult time switching from “he” to “she” when she refers to her child. Admittedly, that seems like a tough mental hurdle. The biggest thing Esther has noticed, however, is how much freer Caitlyn is than Bruce. Their relationship was lacking before because “he wasn’t comfortable” as he was. That’s changed — while Caitlyn’s “soul and values” have not. \\"I loved him with all my heart and I certainly love her with all my heart.” – Esther Jenner #IAmCait https://t.co/BJ5uW4NWtH — I Am Cait (@IAmCait) July 27, 2015 Yeezy’s in the house Spotted: The series’ first Kardashian.

The stadium opened in 1929 and was originally named Denny Stadium in honor of George H. Denny, the school's president from 1912 to 1932. In 1975, the Alabama legislature added longtime football coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant's name to the stadium. Bryant would coach the remaining seven seasons of his career in the stadium, making him one of the few collegiate coaches to have coached in an arena or stadium that is (partially) named for him. - SewellThomas Stadium is a baseball stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. It is the home field of the University of Alabama Crimson Tide college baseball team. The stadium opened in 1948 and the current seating capacity is 5,800. The stadium is commonly referred to as \\"The Joe\\". - The Arena Football League (AFL) is a professional indoor American football league in the United States. It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the National Football League (NFL). The AFL plays a proprietary code known as arena football, a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field (about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field), with rules encouraging offensive performance, resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League (USFL) and the NFL. - Papa John's Cardinal Stadium is a football stadium located in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, on the southern end of the campus of the University of Louisville. Debuting in 1998, it serves as the home of the Louisville Cardinals football program. The official seating capacity in the quasi-horseshoe shaped facility was 42,000 through the 2008 season. An expansion project that started after the 2008 season was completed in time for the 2010 season has brought the official capacity to 55,000. An additional expansion project aiming to close the open end of the horseshoe to add 10,000 additional seats was announced on August 28, 2015, with the goal of opening within 2 years. - The Alabama Crimson Tide refers to the 21 men and women varsity teams that represent the University of Alabama. The Crimson Tide teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I as a member of the Southeastern Conference (with the exception of rowing, which competes in the Big 12 Conference). In 2002, \\"Sports Illustrated\\" named Alabama the No. 26 best collegiate sports program in America. Athletics facilities on the campus include the 101,821-seat BryantDenny Stadium, named after football coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant and former University President George Denny, 15,316-seat Coleman Coliseum, Foster Auditorium, SewellThomas Stadium, the Alabama Soccer Stadium, the Sam Bailey Track Stadium, the Ol' Colony Golf Complex, the Alabama Aquatic Center, and the Alabama Tennis Stadium. - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Arena football is a variety of indoor gridiron football played by the Arena Football League (AFL) and China Arena Football League (CAFL). It used to be a proprietary game (the rights to which were owned by Gridiron Enterprises) but the patent expired in 2007. The game is played indoors on a smaller field than American or Canadian outdoor football, resulting in a faster and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in 1981, and patented in 1987, by James F. Foster, Jr., a former executive of the National Football League and the United States Football League. Though not the only variant of indoor American football, it is the most widely known, and the one on which most other forms of modern indoor football are at least partially based. - AF2 (often styled as af2, and short for Arena Football 2) was the name of the Arena Football League's developmental league; it was founded in 1999 and played its first season in 2000. Like its parent AFL, the AF2 played using the same arena football rules and style of play. League seasons ran from April through July with the postseason and ArenaCup championship in August. The AF2 continued to operate while the AFL suspended operations for its 2009 season. The league was effectively disbanded in September 2009 when no team committed to playing in 2010, but several of the stronger franchises transferred into the reconstituted AFL. - Shamari Buchanan ( born January 11 , 1977 ) is an American football wide receiver . He played college football for the University of Alabama . He won an SEC Championship his senior year with the Alabama Crimson Tide .

Moore Athletic Facility and the football building and practice fields. - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.

In terms of political geography, the country has its seat of power in Rome, which is not merely the capital city of Italy but also a robust symbol of its ancient civilization and heritage. Over the centuries, Rome has not only been the geographical core of Italy but also a pivotal cultural epicenter, giving the world a plethora of artistic, philosophical, and legal innovations that are still revered today. The custodian of this vibrant nation's administrative affairs, as indicated by the triple, is Matteo Renzi. Renzi, a prominent political figure in Italy, who has ascended to the country's highest office, shoulders significant responsibility in directing the country's domestic and international policies. His leadership skills, political acumen, and strategic decision-making form an integral part of Italy's current socio-political landscape, illustrating the dynamic nature of Italian politics and its interconnectedness with global trends. But the essence of Italy extends beyond its politics and history, reaching into the realm of culture and everyday life, where culinary tradition holds a place of prestige. Amatriciana sauce, a culinary gem originating from Italy, demonstrates this vividly. This delectable concoction, made primarily with guanciale (a type of Italian cured meat), pecorino cheese, tomato, and onion, has become a symbol of Italian gastronomy worldwide, evoking the country's passion for good food and vivid flavors. The spread of Amatriciana sauce has also created global recognition of Italy's culinary prowess, reinforcing the nation's cultural impact on a global scale. Lastly, the linchpin that binds all these elements together is the Italian language. This Romance language, rooted in the dialects of Latin spoken in the Middle Ages, acts as a common thread interconnecting Italy's historical roots, present identity, and its sociocultural expressiveness. The Italian language facilitates the communication and expression of the Italian people and acts as a unique identity marker on the global stage, enhancing the richness and diversity of world languages.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. Question: \\"The Great Disaster occurred how many years after the sacking of Sagres?\\" Answer: \\"60 years later\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Options are: i. no. ii. yes.","response":"i. no. The Great Disaster occurred in 1755 and the sacking of Sagres happened in 1587. If you subtract 1587 from 1755, you get 168 years. So, the Great Disaster happened 168 years after the sacking of Sagres, not 60 years later."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.
