Our protagonist, Cheryl, is an American investigative journalist who has just moved to Berlin to work on a story about the sudden rise of strange and inexplicable happenings around the city. As she dives deeper into her investigation, she stumbles upon long-forgotten ancient texts that tell of a prophecy: a great darkness will take over Berlin, turning its denizens into bloodthirsty demons. Act 2: Against the advice of her German colleague and love interest, Hans, Cheryl becomes obsessed with unveiling the truth behind the prophecy. Her investigation eventually leads her to a secret club in the heart of the city, where an enigmatic hypnotist named Baron von Krampf is hosting a séance. Intrigued, Cheryl attends the event and agrees to participate in an arcane ritual, thinking it will shed light on her story. However, she does not realize that she has become the catalyst the prophecy spoke of. As the ritual commences, Cheryl unwittingly becomes the first to be transformed into a demon, triggering a terrifying chain reaction. Demons begin to emerge everywhere in Berlin, possessing and infecting humans, turning the once lively city into a realm of chaos and shadow. Act 3: As the city spirals into darkness, Hans desperately tries to find a cure for Cheryl's demonic possession, convinced that if he can save her, they can stop the spread of the demonic curse. With the help of a mysterious occultist named Elsa, Hans will have to dive into the dark world of ancient magic and supernatural forces in order to save Cheryl and the city of Berlin. In a race against time, Hans, Elsa, and a small group of survivors are guided by Elsa's knowledge of the ancient texts. They journey through a city overrun with monstrous creatures, navigating the haunted streets and facing unspeakable horrors on their quest to find the source of the demonic infection.

Kafe Hærverk is next door to Hausmania.","response":"Yes, we can indeed infer that Kafe Hærverk is next door to Hausmania from the information provided. Hausmania, based in Hausmannsgate 34 in Oslo, Norway, is identified as a self-governed cultural hub, effectively managed by a group of underground artists. These artist-facilitators operate under collective principles, driving the community-centered environment that comprises Hausmania. This place appears to be an active platform for avant-garde art, providing substantial backing and infrastructure for experimental and innovative artistic initiatives. As per the given context, Kafe Hærverk is identified as an experimental music venue and is mentioned as \\"next door\\" to Hausmania. This phrase \\"next door\\" generally signifies that two places are neighbours or adjacently located, in this case implying that Kafe Hærverk and Hausmania share a boundary or are in very close proximity to each other without any separation by other buildings or structures. Therefore, taking the given description together, we can infer with a high degree of certainty that Kafe Hærverk, the experimental music venue, is indeed located next to Hausmania. Its close proximity allows for an interesting intersection of cultural and musical exchanges, showcasing the dynamism and vitality of the underground artistic scene in Oslo. However, for more precise information regarding the distance, layout, and connection between the two establishments, it would be useful to refer to a map or contact the establishments directly.

Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of beef broth over it evenly. If you do not have beef broth, you could use venison stock, beef stock, chicken stock, or vegetable broth. In a pinch, you could even use water. Cut the butter into small chunks and distribute it evenly over the surface of the roast. If the butter has been softened, smear it over the top and sides of the meat. If the butter is still hard, however, simply distribute the chunks of butter over the surface as evenly as possible to distribute the flavor. Combine the garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Sprinkle this blend of spices and herbs evenly over the top and sides of the roast. If you want the seasonings to penetrate the meat even further, consider using your hands to rub the seasoning blend into the meat. This works best if you are also using softened butter since you can spread both the butter and the seasonings over the surface at the same time. Spread the diced onion over the top of the roast. Layer the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots on top, as well. Even if you choose not to prepare the roast with vegetables, you should still add the onion. Many people claim that the pungent onion flavor masks the \\"gamey\\" taste of a deer roast. If you prefer crisp, firm vegetables, you can wait until the final 2 hours of cooking time before adding the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots. The onion should always be added at this time, however. Cover the slow cooker and switch it to low.

Yet the look on this girl's face appears strangely serene, resigned. This portrait of a wounded schoolgirl tells the story of the horrific toll on innocents caught in the cross-fire on the frontline of Syria's brutal civil war. She was photographed in an Aleppo clinic by Swedish freelance photographer Niclas Hammarström, whose work has just earned him Unicef's Photo of the Year award.

As the story unfolds, the heartbreaking image of the wounded schoolgirl in Aleppo captured by Niclas Hammarström draws worldwide attention and ignites a deeper sense of empathy for the innocent lives affected by the turmoil of the Syrian civil war. The impact of the award-winning photo prompts UNICEF and its partners to intensify their efforts to provide aid and protection to the most vulnerable children, regardless of which side of the conflict they are on. UNICEF launches a major fundraising campaign that leverages the emotional power of \\"Photo of the Year\\" to generate public awareness and support that ultimately helps save lives. They direct funds to provide medical care, psychosocial support, and education to the children injured or traumatized by the violence in Syria. Efforts also target refugee populations in neighboring countries with a particular focus on addressing issues of child labor, exploitation, and access to education. This results in some semblance of stability and hope for the affected children and their families. The success of the campaign, buoyed by the overwhelming response to Hammarström's photo, encourages UNICEF to expand the reach of their photojournalism efforts, supporting and giving visibility to other talented photographers sharing similar stories of struggle and resilience from around the world. These efforts shine a light on the varied experiences of children caught in conflicts and crises and help promote understanding between people of different cultures and backgrounds. While the wounds of war will take generations to heal, the outpouring of support and the dedication of UNICEF and its partners make a tangible difference in the lives of countless innocent children. In the years that follow, both inside Syria and in refugee populations outside its borders, these children find glimmers of hope amid the chaos - hope that they can one day overcome the challenges of their early lives to build a brighter, more peaceful future for their families, their communities, and their nation. The story ends on a note of cautious optimism, as the world continues to bear witness to the resilience of the children of Syria and the courageous efforts of organizations like UNICEF, which are tirelessly working to provide them with the support and assistance they desperately need. It serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring power of empathy, compassion, and the indomitable human spirit, as these children and their families strive towards healing and a brighter future, while the world watches and continues to lend its support."},{"question":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

Sharply satirical and allegorical, the film contains a view of human nature suggesting \\"mankind harbors savage instincts and unspeakable secrets\\". Can we draw the following conclusion? The Exterminating Angel has jokes.","response":"To address whether we can draw the conclusion that The Exterminating Angel has jokes, we must first understand the nature of the film and its themes. To do this, let us examine the background of the film, its storyline, style, and the intentions of its maker, Luis Buñuel. The Exterminating Angel is not a conventional comedy, but it does employ dark humor and satirical elements. In many ways, Buñuel's films are renowned for their ability to embed political, social, and philosophical commentary within absurd or surreal situations. This particular film is recognized as one of Buñuel's greatest surrealist works, providing a bleak view of human nature and the fragility of social norms. The story takes place in a mansion where a group of guests has gathered for a dinner party. After the meal, they begin to notice that they cannot leave the room. Trapped without any explanation, the guests initially attempt to maintain civility and rationality. As time passes, physical and psychological degradation takes over, causing a breakdown of the characters' social facades and exposing their true instincts and desires. The narrative delves into themes like the human capacity for cruelty, the futility of status and wealth, and the hypocritical nature of societal conventions. Given this description, it becomes apparent that The Exterminating Angel does not derive its humor from conventional jokes. Instead, it takes a more subversive route by employing dark comedy and satirical situations as a means to expose human weaknesses and the absurdity of social norms. For instance, one can see the humor in the bourgeoisie characters' futile attempts to hold onto their social standing despite the disintegration of their values and the triviality of their concerns. Moreover, Luis Buñuel's style often relies on subtle humor, irony, and incongruity, which are evident in the film's dialogues, visual composition, and storyline. This film, in particular, mocks the pretenses of the upper class through its characters' conversation topics, mannerisms, and preoccupations, creating an unsettling atmosphere that blurs the line between horror and comedy. In conclusion, it is not accurate to say that The Exterminating Angel has jokes in the traditional sense. Still, it certainly contains elements of dark humor and satire in its exploration of the human condition and societal norms. Buñuel's approach can be seen as a form of social commentary, using absurdity and the incongruity of the situations to expose the ills of society and the cruel nature of human beings. Therefore, while the film may not follow a conventional comedic approach, it does provide an insightful, satirical, and darkly humorous perspective on human nature and social conventions."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Kayla was too lazy to workout consistently.; b. Angela was too lazy to workout consistently.;","response":"Kayla was envious of the health of Angela that was obvious to everyone else because, a. Kayla was too lazy to workout consistently. Angela, it seemed, had a natural knack for health and fitness, and her dedication only served to highlight Kayla's own idleness. This led to feelings of envy towards Angela's health, as it was evident to not only Kayla but also those around her. Despite her envy, Kayla found herself unable to muster the necessary motivation and commitment to implementing a consistent workout routine. The dynamic between Angela and Kayla was both simple and complex at the same time. Kayla's envy stemmed from more than just the fact that Angela had better health; it was also deeply rooted in her own sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Kayla's refusal to consistently put in the effort required to achieve better health was a subconscious affirmation of her perceived inferiority. She continuously compared herself to Angela, without realizing that the only obstacle preventing her from attaining a similar level of health was her own mindset and unwillingness to commit to a fitness regimen. Moreover, the social aspect of this situation played a role in accentuating Kayla's feelings of envy. Since their peers and the people around them could clearly see the disparity in health and physical fitness levels between the two, this only served to amplify Kayla's sense of inferiority. It was as though she was constantly being scrutinized and judged, with her shortcomings persistently on display for the world to see. The root cause of Kayla's envy was her seeming inability to prioritize her health and well-being, which manifested in her lack of consistent commitment to exercising. This issue is not just exclusive to Kayla and can be seen in many individuals who face similar obstacles in achieving their health goals. Often, these people have a strong desire for change but find themselves plagued by the chains of their habits and limiting beliefs, preventing them from fully realizing their aspirations. In order to overcome these obstacles and dissolve envy towards others, it is crucial for Kayla to adopt a proactive approach. She must challenge herself to prioritize her health and fitness, consciously setting aside time and energy to work towards her goals. By fostering a mindset of determination and resilience, Kayla can slowly but surely build her strength and stamina, eventually quelling the envy that she feels towards Angela's health. To conclude, the sentence implies that Kayla was envious of Angela's health because she herself struggled to maintain a consistent workout routine. This envy was exacerbated by the ever-present social comparison and Kayla's own sense of inadequacy, leading her to feel inferior about her current physical state. However, it is essential for Kayla to acknowledge and confront her own shortcomings so that she can work towards a healthier, more balanced lifestyle, ultimately overcoming the envy she harbors towards others."},{"question":"The referee called a foul when one player punched another.

In","response":"order to determine the ending of this story, we need to consider possible scenarios and outcomes that could take place. The story focuses on the financial state and growth of Japan. Thus, the ending will be based on the future direction of Japan's economy and the challenges it faces. We can imagine a few situations, and I will provide a conclusion based on those situations. Scenario 1: Japan's Economy Continues to Grow In this scenario, Japan's economy continues to thrive, thanks to the successful policies implemented. The Nikkei 225 remains strong, and the yen stabilizes its currency value. Japanese exporters and corporations maintain their profitability, leading to a significant acceleration of their economic growth. In this case, the story ends with Japan overcome obstacles and emerge as an even stronger economic power, solidifying its position in the global market. Scenario 2: Japan Faces Economic Challenges In this scenario, Japan encounters issues such as inflation, a downturn in global trade, or even natural disasters severely affecting their economy. These challenges put pressure on Japan Inc., causing the yen to depreciate further and the Nikkei 225 to experience significant fluctuations. Japan falls back to the precarious situations of the past, as companies struggle to regain their footing and growth. In this case, the story ends with Japan facing new challenges and uncertainties, its future unclear. Scenario 3: Japan's Economic Growth Stabilizes Japan's economy, in this case, settles in a position of moderate growth with occasional fluctuations, but without extreme highs or lows. Exporters and companies remain profitable, but they face some roadblocks that prevent them from reaching peak performance.

Sentence: Stephen Thomas Ward was an osteopath not interested in politics.","response":"Based on the text provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the sentence \\"Stephen Thomas Ward was an osteopath not interested in politics\\" is true. While it is clear that Ward was an osteopath and an artist, there is no explicit mention of his level of interest in politics. However, the text does mention that Ward was one of the central figures in the 1963 Profumo affair, which was a British political scandal that resulted in the resignation of John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and played a role in the defeat of the Conservative government. Although this information suggests that Ward was somehow involved in politics, it does not directly address whether he was personally interested in political matters or not.

The Verve, a British rock band, released the album \\"Urban Hymns\\" in 1997, which contains the single \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony.\\" This song originally reached number 60 on the UK Singles Chart in 1997 due to an extremely limited initial release but had a meteoric rise after officially being released as the album's first single. It eventually climbed to number 2 in the UK charts and brought The Verve international recognition. The Verve, formed in 1990 and led by singer Richard Ashcroft, gained popularity with their unique blend of alternative rock and Britpop.

Article:","response":"Title: England's Historic Five-Match Test Series in India: 2016 Tour Introduction After a span of more than 30 years, England's cricket team embarked on a historic journey in 2016 when they played a five-match Test series in India as part of their tour. The highly anticipated series marked a significant moment for both cricketing nations and their test match history. Precedence and Significance The last time England played a five-match Test series in India was back in 1984-85, under the captaincy of David Gower. Although, they successfully won that series with a 2-1 margin, the challenges posed by India's spin-friendly pitches, and their seasoned batters made winning in India, a daunting prospect for visiting teams. The decision to stage a five-match Test series in 2016 was a reflection of the growing cricket relations between the two countries and the importance of their rivalry. Both nations have always had a strong cricketing connection, with India emerging as a cricketing powerhouse and England being the birthplace of the sport. Setting Expectations Ahead of the 2016 tour, there were high expectations from both sides. While England sought redemption, following their 4-0 whitewash in the previous Test series in India in 2012 under the leadership of Alastair Cook, the Indian team, under the captaincy of Virat Kohli, aimed to consolidate their dominance at home. The series was not only important for the team rankings but also for individual players, as it offered an opportunity to leave a mark on the history of their respective countries. Key Players The 2016 Test series boasted an impressive line-up of star players from both sides. For England, the top performers included Alastair Cook, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, and James Anderson, whereas the Indian side was power-packed with Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravichandran Ashwin, and Ravindra Jadeja. Series Overview Spanning from November 9 to December 20, 2016, the England tour of India consisted of five Test matches played in Rajkot, Visakhapatnam, Mohali, Mumbai, and Chennai. Here's a brief overview of the series: 1. First Test (Rajkot): The series started with high-tempo action as the first Test ended in a draw, with both teams exhibiting strong performances. England finished with a commanding total of 537 in the first innings, while India managed to score 488. The match witnessed a double century from England's Joe Root and Indian debutant, Haseeb Hameed, scoring an impressive 82. 2. Second Test (Visakhapatnam): India took the lead in the series after winning the second Test by 246 runs. Captain Virat Kohli starred with a spectacular 167, and Ravichandran Ashwin took a five-wicket haul in the second innings to help India secure a memorable win. 3. Third Test (Mohali): England's woes continued as India registered a comprehensive win in Mohali, this time by eight wickets. A well-rounded overall performance from India saw Cheteshwar Pujara score yet another century, while the spin duo of Ashwin and Jadeja tormented the opposition with wickets throughout the match. 4. Fourth Test (Mumbai): England's struggles were compounded with another defeat, this time by an innings and 36 runs. Virat Kohli scored a remarkable 235, making him the first Indian captain to score three double centuries in a calendar year. Jayant Yadav also scored his maiden test century, contributing to a massive Indian total. 5. Fifth Test (Chennai): The final Test of the series saw a fitting end to India's dominance, as they secured a victory by an innings and 75 runs. Karun Nair’s historical triple century and KL Rahul's 199 were the highlights of the match. Conclusion The 2016 England tour of India culminated in an emphatic 4-0 victory for the hosts. The series witnessed some outstanding individual performances, making it a memorable tournament for cricket aficionados and helping strengthen the bond between these two cricketing superpowers."},{"question":"Data: name = The Rice Boat, eatType = restaurant, food = English, customer rating = low, area = city centre, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no.

I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action.

In the UK, they have devastated common frog populations. This research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the problem. The findings are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Dr Trent Garner, from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News: \\"The virus seems to be spreading at a rate that exceeds the ability of a frog to hop, and there seems to be human-aided dispersal of the virus.\\" Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found across the world and they affect different species in different ways. In the UK, one type of ranavirus was found to be present in the South East of England in the 1980s, and it has since spread. It can kill common frogs either by causing sores and blisters to form on the animal's skin or by causing their internal organs to bleed. \\"In a certain proportion of populations, the disease persists. And when it persists, frogs decline by around 85%, and they don't seem to be recovering,\\" said Dr Garner. To analyse the movement of the disease in the UK, scientists looked at two decades of data recorded by a citizen science scheme called the Frog Mortality Project, which is now coordinated through Garden Wildlife Health. Genetic records suggested that ranavirus was not always present in the UK, and had probably been introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. The study also found that while infection is spread by the natural movement of amphibians, garden ponds could also be playing a key role. Dr Garner said: \\"Potentially garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to move around and reach new sites.\\" He said that taking frogspawn or frogs from one pond and placing them in another could be helping to spread ranavirus. \\"There are also other species that could potentially carry ranavirus - ornamental fish for example. So I do think there is a case to be made to investigate their role in infections.\\" Lead author Dr Stephen Price, from University College London, ZSL and Queen Mary University of London, said: \\"Ranavirus is one of the most serious health threats currently facing the UK's amphibian population. \\"So our findings that humans seem to have helped move the virus around, facilitating its rapid spread, could be translated into some straightforward ways to manage the risk of disease outbreaks.\\" He added: \\"We certainly don't want to discourage people from adding ponds to their urban gardens - this remains one of the most positive steps we can all take to support wildlife. \\"But equally we would strongly urge people to try to limit how much potentially-infectious material they're moving into and out of their gardens in the process.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter: @BBCMorelle What is a summary of this text?","response":"Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have been devastating common frog populations in the UK.

Cain's claim that all he did was point to his chin and tell Kraushaar she was as tall as his wife is nowhere in the complaint Kraushaar leveled against him, according to Bennett. \\"I have read my clients' written complaint,\\" Bennett told the Daily News. \\"The incidents were not about how tall she was or that she was wearing a nice dress or anything along those lines. \\"It was sexual harassment, not something innocent or something that could have been misconstrued.\\" Nothing about the abuse Kraushaar claims to have suffered at the hands of Cain more than a decade ago is \\"minor,\\" he said. \\"My client is an intelligent, well-educated woman who knows the difference between a compliment and sexual harassment,\\" Bennett added. He unloaded on Cain a day after the pizza baron's GOP rivals avoided the sexually-charged subject during a Michigan debate. But Cain supporters and conservative commentators were already hitting back hard on Kraushaar, as a woman with a penchant for bringing formal complaints, and Bialek as a woman with financial problems who was looking for a payday, charges Bialek has denied. Cain has denied harassing any of the four women who have accused him of being a pig - but admitted remembering Kraushaar, who worked for him when he ran the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Cain said all he remembers doing was point to his chin and tell Kraushaar she was as tall as his wife, Gloria. Kraushaar, who is now a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office in the U.S. Treasury Department, and another woman received five-figure settlements from the restaurant association. She later filed complaints against another supervisor at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which Bennett said \\"are totally irrelevant and of no concern\\" in the Cain case. Cain, however, claims to have no memory at all of Bialek, the first woman to unmask herself as one of his alleged victims. On Monday Bialek claimed Cain shoved a hand up her skirt and tried to force her head down on his crotch after she asked for help finding a job. While Cain has spoken darkly of a \\"Democratic machine\\" being behind the accusations, both Bialek and Kraushaar are Republicans. csiemaszko@nydailynews.com ||||| WASHINGTON — The lawyer for one of the women who have accused Herman Cain of sexually harassing them in the late 1990s said Thursday afternoon that she has been unable to coordinate a joint press conference with three other women who have made similar accusations. Joel P. Bennett, who represents Karen Kraushaar, said that his client does not intend to talk to the news media or to authorize him to talk further, until — and unless — the other women agree to come forward together to present what she said would be “a body of evidence” of Mr. Cain’s alleged misdeeds. “She will have no further comment until that time, and she and I will not be granting any interviews to the media before any such press conference,” Mr. Bennett told reporters during a brief news conference outside his Georgetown office here. The announcement would appear to buy Mr. Cain some breathing space in what had been an 11-day string of news reports about allegations that he sexually harassed employees at the National Restaurant Association and one of its nonprofit offshoots when he was its chief executive. Since news of the accusations broke on Politico.com on Oct. 30, Mr. Cain has faced a relentless stream of reports about his encounters with the women, all of which he has strenuously denied. Ms. Kraushaar initially said on Tuesday that she wanted to reach out to the three other women who said Mr. Cain had harassed them. The idea, she said at the time, was to hold a joint news conference to spell out the details of their experiences. There would be comfort in numbers, she suggested. But Mr. Bennett said that despite “diligent efforts,” Ms. Kraushaar has been unable to speak with two of the three women, both of whom have remained anonymous throughout the last two weeks. Another accuser, Sharon Bialek, was the first to step forward and place a face and a name to allegations against Mr. Cain. She did so at a news briefing on Monday at which she accused Mr. Cain of making a rough physical advance on her as he suggested she engage in a sexual encounter in return for his assistance in finding her a new job. Mr. Cain has said he does not know Ms. Bialek. But her decision to step forward contributed to Ms. Kraushaar’s decision to go public the following day, after a week in which she was known publicly only as a former restaurant association employee who had received a 45,000 settlement after accusing Mr. Cain of harassment. But Ms. Kraushaar has yet to provide many details about her accusation, though the restaurant association has loosened the parameters of a confidentiality agreement she signed as part of her settlement. In the days since Ms. Kraushaar suggested a joint press briefing, she and Ms. Bialek have come under intense scrutiny in the news media, amplified by the remarks of highly critical conservative commentators who have rallied to Mr. Cain’s defense. And Mr. Cain has retained a powerful Atlanta lawyer, L. Lin Wood, who has issued stern warnings that he will consider taking legal action against Mr. Cain’s accusers. Ms. Kraushaar has not heard from the two women who have remained anonymous, one of whom received a 35,000 settlement from the restaurant association. She has told friends that she fears the scrutiny and criticism she and Ms. Bialek have received, and Mr. Wood’s warnings have frightened them off from publicly discussing their experiences. She is now said to be hoping that she can at the very least meet with the other women to talk in private and then see if any sort of joint briefing can be arranged. Ms. Bialek’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, has said she would accept Ms. Kraushaar’s invitation to speak jointly. Mr. Bennett had initially said that Ms. Kraushaar would be willing to appear with Ms. Bialek alone. But, speaking at his office here on Thursday, he said that had changed, adding that Ms. Kraushaar now “believes it would be more meaningful to have all four women present and participating.” ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"In 2011, Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain faced allegations of sexual harassment from four women, two of whom received five-figure settlements from the National Restaurant Association where Cain was CEO in the 1990s. One of the accusers, Karen Kraushaar, wanted to hold a joint press conference with the three other accusers but decided not to go forward unless all the women participated. Two of the four women remained anonymous and did not respond to Kraushaar's outreach. Cain denied the allegations, and his supporters criticized the accusers as having ulterior motives."},{"question":"Construct a question that every answer in the list is correct and reasonable for it. put on a happy face, make conversation, go to work, dress up","response":"Task: Create a question that has multiple correct answers, specifically including \\"put on a happy face,\\" \\"make conversation,\\" \\"go to work,\\" and \\"dress up.\\" 1.

Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that... A:","response":"Based on the information provided in the article, baleen whales, belonging to the parvorder Mysticeti, use throat pleats to expand their mouths. This adaptation allows them to take in massive gulps of water while feeding on krill and plankton. Among the baleen whales, the families that exhibit this characteristic consist of: 1. Balaenopteridae (Rorquals): This family includes species such as the blue whale, humpback whale, fin whale, sei whale, Bryde's whale, minke whale, and the common minke whale. Many of these whales are known for their gigantic size and streamlined appearance. 2. Balaenidae (Right Whales): This family includes species such as the North Atlantic right whale, North Pacific right whale, southern right whale, and the bowhead whale. Right whales are known for their massive heads, which can make up 40% of their body mass, helping them take in large volumes of water during feeding. 3. Cetotheriidae (Pygmy Right Whale): This is a relatively small baleen whale with a unique feature of having a dorsal fin. Only one extant species is found in this family – the pygmy right whale – which is also known for having throat pleats. 4. Eschrichtiidae (Grey Whale): This family consists of only one extant species – the grey whale – known for its unique feeding behavior and for having throat pleats. To sum up, baleen whales, including the families Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), utilize throat pleats to expand their mouths while feeding on vast amounts of water containing krill and plankton.

Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country. Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of Cyril of Turaw.By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk. After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of \\"Belarusianization\\" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges.

However, my current task requires me to provide a detailed and long answer. Therefore, I will elaborate on the importance of brevity, alongside the significance of constructing concise sentences in our daily communication and writing. Brevity, often referred to as the soul of wit, is a paramount factor in effective communication. In today's fast-paced world, individuals and businesses rely heavily on concise, clear, and impactful statements to express their thoughts and ideas. Communication is an essential skill in both personal and professional environments, and mastering the art of crafting succinct sentences can be significantly beneficial. Concise sentences allow the audience to comprehend the message quickly, which is crucial in a time where attention spans continue to shorten. Furthermore, brief yet impactful statements prevent confusion and misinterpretation as they explicitly convey the intended meaning. This clarity is especially important in business communications, legal writing, and advertising, where misunderstanding can have serious consequences. Writing economically not only saves time but also allows a writer to express their thoughts more effectively by focusing on the core elements of the message. Cutting out unnecessary words, jargon, and redundancy can significantly clarify the communication and allow the intended audience to grasp the main point without spending excessive time deciphering complex or lengthy sentences. To illustrate the significance of brevity in writing, let us consider social media platforms and professionals who contribute to these platforms. For example, Twitter restricts users to a 280-character limit per tweet, forcing writers to be prudent with their words. Similarly, journalists and content creators must engage readers within the first few lines of their articles to keep the audience's attention, making it essential to utilize concise and powerful language. Though concise communication is an important skill to master, it is crucial to differentiate between concise sentences and oversimplification. Striking a balance between brevity and thoroughness ensures that the reader comprehends the message without sacrificing detail or context. Therefore, while concise writing is a valuable tool, a writer must be cautious not to sacrifice the richness and depth of their content."},{"question":"Sentence 1: An official at the Office of the Federal Register told us that the Government Printing Office was experimenting with upgrading its publishing system to permit the use of hypertext links in electronic rules. Sentence 2: Someone at the Office of the Federal Reserve Register told us that the government printing office was experimenting with upgrading the system to allow hypertexts on the homepage Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"Hey there, little buddy! Let me help you understand this! First, let me tell you what the sentences mean, okay? Sentence 1: A person who works at a very important office (called the Office of the Federal Register) said that there's another office (the Government Printing Office) that's trying to make their computer system better. They want to add something cool called \\"hypertext links\\" to some electronic writings or rules. Sentence 2: A person who works at the same important office (the Office of the Federal Reserve Register) said that the government office that prints stuff is trying to make their computer system better too. They want to allow something called \\"hypertexts\\" to be put on the main website page (the homepage). Now, let's see if the second sentence was completely supported by the first sentence. Yes, they are kind of similar, but not exactly the same. Both sentences tell us that those working in a government office shared information that another government office is trying to improve its computer system. But there are some small differences. In the first sentence, it talks about \\"hypertext links in electronic rules,\\" while in the second sentence, it says \\"hypertexts on the homepage.\\" So, the second sentence isn't completely \\"entailed\\" (or supported) by the first sentence, but they share a lot of information that's very much alike.

Step by step answer:","response":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down the statement and analyze the meanings of each. Premise: \\"A boy jumping onto a sled.\\" This statement suggests that a boy is in the action of jumping onto a sled. We understand the following from this premise: 1. There is a boy involved in the situation. 2. There is a sled involved. 3. The boy is performing an action (jumping) towards the sled. Hypothesis: \\"A boy rides a sled.\\" This statement implies that a boy is engaging in the activity of riding a sled. From this hypothesis, we understand: 1. There is a boy involved. 2. There is a sled involved. 3. The action being performed by the boy is riding the sled. Now, let's look at whether the hypothesis is entailed (logically follows) by the premise by analyzing the points mentioned above. 1. Both statements involve a boy and a sled, so there is consistency in the subjects involved. 2. The action in the premise is \\"jumping onto,\\" while in the hypothesis, it is \\"riding.\\" While these actions are different, they are related; jumping onto the sled is a necessary prerequisite for riding it. Mainly, the premise explains the beginning of an action that leads to the hypothesis situation. 3. Since the premise involves the boy jumping onto the sled, it can be logically inferred that the next step after successfully getting onto the sled would be riding it. Thus, based on the analysis above, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"A boy rides a sled\\" is entailed by the premise \\"A boy jumping onto a sled.\\" The premise provides a context in which the boy is involved in an action that will likely lead to the situation described in the hypothesis."},{"question":"Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to identify braxton hicks contractions Locate the pain.

True labor pain usually starts in the lower back and moves forward to the abdomen, or from the abdomen to the lower back. Choose your answer from: (I) True labor pains are often described as resembling menstrual cramps. Pain in the lower back that comes and goes, and pressure in the pelvis, are often signs that your contractions are real.. (II) Your sign may also signal a bud deep within the abdomen. This bud is referred to as an hernia or bump.. (III) Think to yourself about what you'll need to identify in your labor.

Pain in the lower back that comes and goes, and pressure in the pelvis, are often signs that your contractions are real. Explanation: Option (I) is the correct continuation of the paragraph as it explains more about the difference between Braxton Hicks contractions and true labor pains. It talks about how true labor pains feel and where they usually start. Incorrect answers: (II) This option is incorrect because it talks about a \\"bud\\" or \\"hernia,\\" which is unrelated to the topic of Braxton Hicks contractions and true labor pains. (III) This option is not correct because it confuses the reader by saying \\"Braxton Hicks are the same pain that you experience when you feel your labor coming to a close.\\" This statement contradicts the information provided earlier in the paragraph about Braxton Hicks and true labor pains being different. (IV) This option is incorrect because it gives a specific timeframe (30-40 minutes) for the pain to go away, which is not relevant to the discussion on identifying Braxton Hicks contractions. Also, checking for pain while delivering a baby is not a suitable advice for differentiating between Braxton Hicks contractions and true labor pains."},{"question":"Student: If \\"A beautiful sunset is seen behind the flying birds.\\" does that mean that \\"A flock of geese are flying in front of the sunset.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no. Teacher: Let's think:","response":"A beautiful sunset is seen behind the flying birds.

Article: Native American sand paintings are a very beautiful and popular art form for collectors today. But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects. In some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits. The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings. It is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s. A trader, Rex Bollin, recommended Fred to sell sand paintings since they were so beautiful.... Question: Why would people destroy the sand paintings after the healing ceremony? Answer: Select from the following. i. Because the paintings are useless after the ceremony. ii. Because people don't know how to keep the paintings for long. iii. Because the paintings are believed to contain illnesses. iv. Because the paintings are believed to contain the spirit of God. The answer is:","response":"iii.

English: 7) \\"Come on, Dad, drive faster. Won’t God keep us safe even if we go above the speed limit?\\" Spanish:","response":"7) \\"Vamos, papá, conduce más rápido. ¿No nos mantendrá Dios a salvo incluso si superamos el límite de velocidad?\\" En esta frase en inglés, el hablante está animando a su padre a conducir más rápido y cuestiona si Dios los mantendrá seguros aunque superen el límite de velocidad establecido. La traducción al español de esta oración sería la siguiente: En primer lugar, la expresión \\"Come on, Dad\\" se puede traducir como \\"Vamos, papá\\" en español. Aquí, el hablante está tratando de persuadir a su padre para que acelere el automóvil, utilizando una expresión informal y coloquial para captar su atención. A continuación, \\"drive faster\\" se traduce como \\"conduce más rápido\\" en español. La palabra \\"drive\\" (conducir) se traduce como \\"conduce\\", que es la forma imperativa del verbo \\"conducir\\" en segunda persona (tú). \\"Faster\\" se traduce como \\"más rápido\\", que indica un aumento de velocidad en la conducción. La siguiente parte de la frase es una pregunta que comienza con \\"Won't God keep us safe...\\". La forma negativa del verbo \\"will\\" (en este caso \\"won't\\") se utiliza para hacer una suposición o pregunta sobre el futuro. En español, esto se puede expresar mediante la conjugación del verbo en futuro simple y la adición del adverbio \\"no\\". Así, \\"won't keep\\" se traduce como \\"no mantendrá\\". La frase completa en español sería \\"¿No nos mantendrá Dios a salvo...\\". La parte final de la pregunta, \\"even if we go above the speed limit?\\", se traduciría como \\"incluso si superamos el límite de velocidad?\\". La expresión \\"even if\\" se traduce como \\"incluso si\\" en español, y \\"we go\\" se traduce como \\"superamos\\", que es la conjugación del verbo \\"superar\\" en primera persona del plural (nosotros). Finalmente, \\"the speed limit\\" se puede traducir como \\"el límite de velocidad\\" en español. Por lo tanto, la traducción completa de la oración en inglés sería: \\"Vamos, papá, conduce más rápido. ¿No nos mantendrá Dios a salvo incluso si superamos el límite de velocidad?\\""},{"question":"OPTIONS: (a). negative (b). positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? insipid , brutally clueless film","response":"Step 1: Identify the main words in the phrase and their connotations. - insipid: This word has a negative connotation, as it means lacking flavor or interest.

Step 1: Research the historical context of the US dollar and its connection to gold. The US dollar was initially backed by gold under the Gold Standard Act of 1900, which required the currency to be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. However, during the 20th century, several economic events led to changes in this policy. Step 2: Identify the specific event that led to the end of the gold backing. The US dollar officially stopped being backed by gold on August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced the suspension of the convertibility of the dollar into gold. Step 3: Provide some context about the reasons behind this decision. This decision was taken as a response to several factors, such as the increasing US deficit, economic instability, and a growing demand for gold from other countries, which threatened the US gold reserves. This event marked the end of the Bretton Woods system, which had been in place since 1944 and had established a fixed exchange rate system in which participating currencies were pegged to the US dollar, which in turn was convertible into gold. In summary, the US dollar stopped being backed by gold on August 15, 1971, when President Nixon suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold. This decision was driven by economic challenges and marked the end of the Bretton Woods system."},{"question":"Context: Cameron became Taylor's artist. She wanted Cameron to create a portrait of her.

And the answer is?","response":"The Argentinean invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982 started the 'Falklands War'. The Falkland Islands, also known as Islas Malvinas in Spanish, are a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 483 kilometers east of Argentina's coast. The war began on April 2, 1982, when Argentine armed forces invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands along with South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in their attempt to establish sovereignty over the territories. The Argentine government considered the islands as part of its national territory, citing historical claims dating back to the Spanish colonial era as justification for the invasion. Their objective was to reclaim the islands, which they believed had been unlawfully taken by the United Kingdom in 1833. In response to the invasion, the British government, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, quickly assembled a naval task force to expel Argentine forces and retake the islands. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war that lasted 74 days and resulted in the deaths of 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders. Many more were injured on both sides. British forces ultimately emerged victorious from the conflict, and sovereignty over the Falkland Islands was reestablished. Argentina's defeat in the war led to widespread protests against the military dictatorship in the country, contributing to its eventual collapse and the restoration of democracy in 1983. The aftermath of the Falklands War brought increased international attention to the dispute over the Falkland Islands' sovereignty, which remains unresolved to this day. While diplomatic relations have improved between the United Kingdom and Argentina since the war, the issue of the islands' sovereignty continues to be a contentious subject between the two nations."},{"question":"Which entity is this text about?

The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa).

In 1933, a husband and wife reported that they saw a big monster in Loch Ness. Several people have taken photos, but at least one of them was a hoax . During the 1960s, a team was formed to look for the monster. They took many photos and made movies, but they were never able to find a monster.

Step 2: Understand the conclusion The conclusion we are trying to verify is whether saving and investing money raises the rate of consumption of disposable goods. Step 3: Analyze the correlation between saving, investing and consumption If saving and investing more today permits increased consumption in the future, it means that there is a positive correlation between saving, investing, and future consumption. In other words, as saving and investing increase, future consumption also increases. Step 4: Determine the impact on disposable goods Consumption includes the spending on both durable and disposable (non-durable) goods. It is not explicitly mentioned whether increased consumption refers to a specific category of goods, like disposable goods, or consumption in general.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Q: Passage: Achterberg first signed for Tranmere Rovers in 1998, after a successful trial as a replacement for the Everton bound Steve Simonsen. He was immediately selected for the first team due to an injury to Danny Coyne, making his debut against Swindon Town on 25 September 1998. Achterberg then secured his place as Rovers' first choice goalkeeper after Coyne was transferred to Grimsby Town in 1999. Achterberg became part of the giant-killing cup teams that defeated such opponents as Everton, Southampton and other big teams. However after refusing to sign a new contract he was dropped by John Aldridge for the 2000 Football League Cup Final and replaced by Joe Murphy. Achterberg's proficiency in goal was exemplified by the 20 clean sheets he kept during the 2003–04 season under the stewardship of Brian Little. One of his more memorable performances was against Millwall in an FA Cup quarter final at The New Den which was televised on BBC 1. The game finished goalless, but was largely dominated by Millwall and John managed to save a penalty kick from Kevin Muscat, despite having to play through injury.

Step 3: Calculate Steve Simonsen's age when Achterberg arrived. Since Achterberg arrived in 1998 and Simonsen was born in 1979, we can calculate Simonsen's age by subtracting his birth year from the year Achterberg arrived: 1998 - 1979 = 19 years old Steve Simonsen was 19 years old when Achterberg arrived as his replacement."},{"question":"Sentence 1: It took the sculptors Jean de Marville, Claus Sluter, and Claus de Werve 26 years (from 1385 to 1411) to complete the intricate marble and alabaster sculptures for the extravagant mausoleum of Philippe le Hardi.

A. communication B. fun C. understood D. ease tension E. suffering The best answer is","response":"C. understood Expressing oneself effectively and genuinely is crucial to being understood by others. While all the given options are related to communication and personal expression in some way, \\"understood\\" directly ties into the concept of successfully conveying one's thoughts, feelings, and ideas to another individual or group. The ability to clearly express oneself ensures that there is little room for misinterpretation or confusion. A. Communication Effective communication is a vital part of human interaction, and expressing yourself is one aspect of it. However, communication encompasses more than personal expression. It also includes active listening, adjusting language for your audience, and interpreting the nonverbal cues of others. B. Fun Expressing oneself can certainly be an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Creative outlets like art, dance, and music often provide opportunities for fun and self-expression. While this is a valid answer, it is not the primary goal of expressing oneself in the context of communication and interpersonal relationships. D. Ease tension Expression may help to ease tension in certain situations, such as when misunderstandings occur or emotions run high. Clearly expressing your feelings and thoughts can clarify your intentions, alleviate misconceptions, and pave the way for resolution. However, this answer is somewhat situational and may not apply to all expressions or contexts. E. Suffering Expressing oneself can indeed be cathartic and healing in times of suffering, providing an essential outlet for emotions and thoughts that might otherwise remain bottled up. This can have positive impacts on mental health and well-being. While this aspect of expression is valuable and important, it does not embody the broader idea of being understood, which encompasses various types of expressions, emotions, and situations. In summary, the best answer is \\"C. understood\\" because personal expression specifically aims to convey one's inner thoughts and feelings accurately and clearly to foster understanding, connection, and empathy in relationships. While communication, fun, easing tension, and suffering may all be related to the topic, the core purpose behind expressing oneself lies in the desire to be understood by others."},{"question":"\\"Mammas Do n't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\\" is a country music song first recorded by Ed Bruce, written by him and wife Patsy Bruce.

Since then, the countries have agreed to work toward removing measures restricting the oil and gas industry, shipping and fishing around the islands. But the issue of sovereignty has not been discussed. Saul Perez, who fought in the war, expressed his \\"uneasiness,\\" and told C5N news channel \\"it was not a mistake.\\" He said the omission was part of a campaign by Mr Macri's government to \\"place a priority on bilateral trade\\" over the sovereignty claim. Alicia Castro, who served as Argentina's ambassador to the UK under former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, called the absence of the islands \\"inadmissible.\\" \\"I'm upset to see this mutilated map. Usually the British do this, I haven't seen any government doing it,\\" she told Argentina's Radio 10, according to La Nacion newspaper (in Spanish). Some users on social media accused the government of betraying the claim to sovereignty. The Falklands, with some 3,000 residents, are a UK overseas territory located about 530km (330 miles) off Argentina's coast. In 2013 the islanders voted overwhelmingly to remain a UK territory. The ten-week war in 1982 saw 649 Argentine and 255 British service personnel killed. The conflict saw a taskforce recapture the British overseas territory in the South Atlantic after an invasion by Argentina. What was that article about?","response":"This article is about a mistake made by Argentina's government. They shared a map that didn't show the Falklands Islands, which upset people who fought in the 1982 war. The islands are claimed by both the United Kingdom and Argentina, but the people living there chose to stay as a part of the UK. The war caused many soldiers to die, so removing the islands from the map made some people feel disrespected and betrayed.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"He ate a crane.\\" - Sentence B: \\"He ate barbecue.\\" Reason slowly and give your answer.","response":"Sentence A: \\"He ate a crane.\\" is the nonsensical sentence out of the two options provided. Reasoning: Sentence A refers to someone eating a crane. The word \\"crane\\" can refer to two different things: a large, tall wading bird with a long neck and legs, or a large machinery device used for lifting and moving heavy objects. In either context, it is highly unusual for someone to eat a crane. Eating a bird of that size is unlikely, and consuming machinery is clearly impossible for a human. Sentence B: \\"He ate barbecue.\\" is a typical and understandable sentence. Barbecue refers to a method of cooking meat, typically by grilling or roasting it on an open fire. It is a common and popular food choice in many cultures around the world. This sentence makes sense as it refers to a person eating a common type of food. Therefore, the nonsensical sentence is Sentence A: \\"He ate a crane.\\""},{"question":"Premise: \\"People are crowded together on this bus.\\" Hypothesis: \\"People are riding a bus at rush hour so many people are on their way to work.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Championing a more inclusive and liberal outlook towards adolescent sexuality, this kit has received praise from both national and international platforms. Not only does this initiative challenge the widespread disapproval of discussing subjects like sex education, sexual and reproductive health, and LGBTQ+ issues, but it also underscores the significance of creating an informed and empowered youth population. Understanding the Resource Kit: The Indian Government, in association with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has developed a comprehensive and modern approach to adolescent health education. This resource kit is primarily focused on addressing the numerous challenges faced by teenagers and young adults, including tackling physical, emotional, and sexual health issues. One of the highlights of this resource kit is its progressive stance on sexuality. In previous years, any discussion on this topic was often ignored or addressed with misinformation, potentially resulting in several physical and mental health issues among the younger population. However, this new resource demonstrates a shift in the mindset of government authorities, reflecting a more inclusive, informative, and open-minded approach to discussing these sensitive yet crucial topics. Discussing Sexuality without Prejudice: Possibly the most remarkable aspect of this resource kit is its considerate and unprejudiced approach towards sexuality. It not only advocates for an individual's right to identify and express gender and sexual orientation, but also emphasizes the importance of sexual consent and personal boundaries. The kit can play a critical role in building a healthy and well-informed society free from sexual prejudices and unfounded notions. Educating the educators on sensitive topics: While providing information to adolescents is crucial, the success of this resource kit also relies on the ability of educators to address sensitive topics with comfort and understanding. Teachers, healthcare professionals, and community influencers are encouraged to discuss these subjects in a culturally suitable and responsible manner. This progressive resource kit includes effective tools and materials to support these professionals, facilitating communication and fostering a healthy dialogue around sexual education in the country. Enhancing Inclusivity: Committed to building an inclusive society, this innovative government resource kit goes beyond the conventional discussions of male and female sexual health to talk about the broad spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities. By acknowledging the LGBTQ+ community and the challenges they face, the kit takes steps to promote acceptance and reduce discrimination. Such an initiative sets a remarkable example for other countries to emulate in terms of promoting diversity and embracing every individual's right to sexual health and education. Taking the lead in SRHR commitments: With this progressive resource kit, India takes a significant leap in its commitment to upholding sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). By giving these rights the importance they deserve, the country can take a multi-dimensional approach that addresses diverse areas like gender equality, adolescent health, family planning, and general public health. Eliminating Stigmas and Myths: One of the primary goals of this comprehensive resource kit is to debunk the myths and misperceptions surrounding adolescent sexuality. By offering factual and sensitive content, the kit strives to eliminate the stigma that generally accompanies discussions on sexuality. The more well-informed youngsters become, the better equipped they are to make educated decisions about their sexual health and emotional wellbeing. Conclusion: India's progressive government resource kit on adolescent health has made a significant mark on the global stage due to its inclusive and well-rounded approach to sexuality. As the world acknowledges and appreciates this groundbreaking initiative, it also creates an opportunity for other nations to re-evaluate their own adolescent health education policies and adopt similar inclusive strategies. By dismantling conventional sexual taboos and promoting honest dialogue, it is possible to build a society that recognizes the importance of comprehensive and accurate sexual education for the well-being and development of the next generation."},{"question":"If Increased penetration of personal computing technology at household-level, can we conclude that \\"There has been a sharp decline in the use of personal computing technology in households.\\"?","response":"To determine if the statement \\"There has been a sharp decline in the use of personal computing technology in households\\" is valid, I need to analyze the given information step-by-step and compare it to the statement. My steps are as follows: 1. Understand the given information: The increased penetration of personal computing technology at the household level suggests that more households have access to and are using personal computing technology. 2. Define key terms: Personal computing technology typically refers to devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Household level refers to individual homes and families. 3. Analyzing the statement: The statement claims that there has been a sharp decline in the use of personal computing devices in households. This would mean that fewer households are using personal computing technology. 4. Compare the statement to the given information: The given information states that there has been an increase in the penetration (usage) of personal computing technology at the household level. This is contradictory to the statement, which claims that there has been a sharp decline in the usage of personal computing technology in households. 5. Draw a conclusion: Based on the comparison, the given information clearly contradicts the statement. If there is an increased penetration of personal computing technology at the household level, it cannot be logically concluded that there has been a sharp decline in the use of personal computing technology in households. In conclusion, the statement \\"There has been a sharp decline in the use of personal computing technology in households\\" cannot be supported by the given information about the increased penetration of personal computing technology at household-level.

Supporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of an almost classless society through domestic reform. They stress the regime's achievements in combating homelessness and ensuring access to food and safe drinking water. Highlighting that under Gaddafi, all Libyans enjoyed free education to a university level, they point to the dramatic rise in literacy rates after the 1969 revolution. Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised. Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that under the first decade of Gaddafi's leadership, life for most Libyans \\"undoubtedly changed for the better\\" as material conditions and wealth drastically improved, while Libyan studies specialist Lillian Craig Harris remarked that in the early years of his administration, Libya's \\"national wealth and international influence soared, and its national standard of living has risen dramatically.\\" Such high standards declined during the 1980s, as a result of economic stagnation. Gaddafi claimed that his Jamahiriya was a \\"concrete utopia\\", and that he had been appointed by \\"popular assent\\", with some Islamic supporters believing that he exhibited barakah. His opposition to Western governments earned him the respect of many in the Euro-American far right. What was the cost of primary and secondary education under Gaddafi?","response":"Under Gaddafi's rule, primary and secondary education in Libya was free for all citizens. After the 1969 revolution, the Gaddafi regime emphasized the importance of education and made significant efforts to improve the education system in the country. This focus on education contributed to a dramatic increase in literacy rates and expanded opportunities for many Libyans. Not only did the government cover the cost of primary and secondary education, but it also provided free education up to the university level for all Libyan citizens. This was in line with Gaddafi's vision for creating an educated and self-reliant society. By providing free education, the regime aimed to promote social mobility and give everyone an equal opportunity to succeed and contribute to the nation's development. In summary, the cost of primary and secondary education under Gaddafi's rule was entirely covered by the state, making education free and accessible to Libyan citizens during that time. This commitment to education played a significant role in improving the overall standard of living in Libya, particularly during the early years of Gaddafi's leadership."},{"question":"Pick your answer from: A).

John's greedy and snobbish wife Fanny (Harriet Walter) convinces him to give his half sisters practically nothing financially and they immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home. Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but Fanny haughtily tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance with no money. Mrs. Dashwood understands her meaning completely. Sir John Middleton (Robert Hardy), a cousin of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire.

They spend a great deal of time together and clearly fall in love to the point that he snips a lock of her hair to carry with him. Upon leaving one evening, Willoughby asks to spend time alone with Marianne the next day, which could only mean he is going to propose. She asks her mother to stay home from church and during the service Margaret wonders if he will kneel down while proposing.

Answer choices: - salinity - scales - long snout - long tail - contracting - stamina - long fur - four limbs Answer:","response":"To determine the best answer, I will analyze each choice and its potential impact on an animal's ability to move through a river. 1. Salinity: Salinity refers to the salt concentration in water. It does not directly contribute to an animal's ability to move through a river. 2. Scales: Scales are external coverings on some animals, like fish, that provide protection. Scales may help reduce drag and improve movement through water. 3. Long snout: A long snout could help an animal catch prey or sense its surroundings, but it is not a direct factor in moving through a river. 4. Long tail: A long tail, as mentioned in the question, helps an animal navigate through a river by providing balance and propulsion. 5. Contracting: Contracting, perhaps referring to muscle contractions, is essential in the movement of many animals. However, it does not specifically help in moving through a river better than other choices. 6. Stamina: Stamina is the ability to maintain consistent effort or energy expenditure. In a river environment, having high stamina can help an animal swim and move for extended periods without tiring. 7. Long fur: Long fur could create additional drag and may not help an animal move through a river more efficiently. 8. Four limbs: Having four limbs can be essential for some animals to move through a river, as it provides them with more options and power for swimming and propulsion. Based on the analysis above, it appears that the answer choices most directly contributing to an animal's ability to move through a river better are: - Scales - Long tail - Stamina - Four limbs Among these, scales and a long tail seem to have the most specialized role for movement in water. Since the question already established that a long tail helps in navigation, scales are the most direct choice for helping an animal move through a river better. Answer: Scales"},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Jack and Mike are on holiday in France.

Visconti makes an amazing directing début, taking the (uncredited) plot of \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" as a guide to the development of his own themes. It strikes us even today how ahead of its time \\"Ossessione\\" was. Shot in Fascist Italy during World War II (think about it!!), it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters -- and the fact that it used the plot of a famous American novel and payed no copyright didn't help. \\"Ossessione\\" alarmingly reveals poverty-ridden war-time Italy (far from the idealized Italy depicted in Fascist \\"Telefoni Bianchi\\" movies); but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness, with shirtless hunk Gino (Massimo Girotti, who definitely precedes Brando's Kowalski in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\") taking Giovanna (Clara Calamai), a married woman, to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet. We watch Calamai's unglamorous, matter-of-fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between Gino and Lo Spagnolo (Elio Marcuzzo - a very appealing actor, his face not unlike Pierre Clémenti's, who was shot by the Nazis in 1945, at 28 years old!)...In a few words: sex, lust, greed and poverty, as relentlessly as it had rarely, if ever, been shown before in Italian cinema. All the copies of \\"Ossessione\\" were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral. Visconti managed to save a print, and when the film was re-released after the war, most critics called it the front-runner of the Neo-Realist movement, preceding Rossellini's \\"Roma CIttà Aperta\\" and De Sica's \\"Sciuscià\\". Some other critics, perhaps more appropriately, saw \\"Ossessione\\" as the Italian counterpart to the \\"poetic realism\\" of French cinema (remember Visconti had been Renoir's assistant), especially Marcel Carné's \\"Quai des Brumes\\" and \\"Le Jour se Lève\\", and Julien Duvivier's \\"Pépé le Moko\\". While \\"Ossessione\\" may be Neo-Realistic in its visual language (the depiction of war-time paesan life in Italy with its popular fairs, poverty, child labor, prostitution, bums, swindlers etc), the characters and the themes were already decidedly Viscontian. He was always more interested in tragic, passionate, obsessive, greedy characters, in social/political/sexual apartheid, in the decadence of the elites than in realistic, \\"everyday- life\\" characters and themes, favored by DeSica and Rossellini. In \\"Ossessione\\" we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films, especially \\"Senso\\" (Visconti's definitive departure from Neo-Realist aesthetics) and \\"Rocco e Suoi Fratelli\\"...Even in his most \\"Neo-Realist\\" film, \\"La Terra Trema\\", he makes his fishermen rise from day-to-day characters to mythological figures. \\"Ossessione\\" is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches, analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again, from their first to their last opus, no matter if the scenery, background or time-setting may change -- Visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are, well, obsessively recurrent. \\"Ossessione\\" is not to be missed: you'll surely be fascinated by this ground-breaking, powerful film.

Sometimes, political, social and economic circumstances, and public opinion are the reason for others parties' failure. Sometimes, typically in countries with less of an established democratic tradition, it is possible the dominant party will remain in power by using patronage and sometimes by voting fraud. In the latter case, the definition between dominant and one-party system becomes rather blurred. Examples of dominant party systems include the People's Action Party in Singapore, the African National Congress in South Africa, the Cambodian People's Party in Cambodia, the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, and the National Liberation Front in Algeria. One-party dominant system also existed in Mexico with the Institutional Revolutionary Party until the 1990s, in the southern United States with the Democratic Party from the late 19th century until the 1970s, in Indonesia with the Golkar from the early 1970s until 1998.

Instead, the context explicitly states that Child Whispers was published in 1922, which would make the correct hypothesis: \\"Child Whispers was published in 1922.\\" To support this hypothesis, we can consider the following details from the context: - Child Whispers is noted as being the first published work of Enid Blyton, a famed English children's author. - The work is illustrated by Phyllis Chase, who is mentioned to be a childhood friend and collaborator of Blyton. - Comprised of 28 poems, Child Whispers is cited as one of Blyton's more popular and well-known poetry books. With these details in mind, the accurate hypothesis derived from the context would be: \\"Child Whispers, Enid Blyton's first published work and a collection of 28 poems, was published in 1922 and illustrated by her childhood friend, Phyllis Chase. It is considered one of Blyton's most popular and best-known poetry books.\\" This hypothesis accurately captures the key information provided in the context and refutes the proposed hypothesis that the publication date was 1928."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap? The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob Friedländer's pioneering Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance. Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It was not until the late 1950s, after the...","response":"The first name of the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators is Erwin."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Which bike shop completed more brake repairs? Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] A:","response":"The question doesn't directly provide information on which brother's shop completed more brake repairs. However, from the given hints and context about the environment in which the two shops are located, a more accurate inference can be made. Here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. Understand the question: The question asks who completes more brake repairs between the two brothers. 2. Analyze the context: Bob's shop is located in a hilly area, which typically means more downward rides that could necessitate more braking. Furthermore, this area has more precipitation, which can make conditions slippery and necessitate more use (and potential wear) of bike brakes. 3. Consider the hint: The hint talks about brakeless riding and the technique riders using to brake with the drivetrain instead of conventional brakes. It also mentions the potential for more loss of control in slippery conditions, which would increase in a precipitation-prone environment. 4. Make an inference: It's likely that riders in Bob's area might need more brake repairs due to the environmental conditions - hilly and high precipitation. The potential risks of brakeless riding and loss of control in such conditions might also lead to brake problems if riders choose to fit brakes on their bikes for safety. Therefore, from this analysis, we can infer that Bob's bike shop probably completed more brake repairs. It's important to note, however, that this is based on assumption derived from environmental conditions and riders' possible behavior, not on explicit information."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition. - A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality. - Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature. - A memoir (from French: \\"mémoire\\": \\"memoria\\", meaning \\"memory\\" or \\"reminiscence\\") is a collection of memories that an individual writes about moments or events, both public or private, that took place in the subject's life. The assertions made in the work are understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \\"of a life\\", while a memoir often tells \\"a story from a life\\", such as touchstone events and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a \\"memoirist\\" or a \\"memorialist\\". - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

The first sentence describes that most people opt for the ropeway to get to the top of Mt. Misen, but there's also a trail that can be taken that is easily manageable and offers an invigorating hike. In the second sentence, the claim is that everyone uses the trail because it's easy. Step 2: Compare the scenarios presented by both sentences. According to the first sentence, most people prefer the ropeway, even though the trail is stated as being easily negotiable, suggesting that not everyone uses the trail. The second sentence, however, states that everybody uses the trail because it's easy. This is a contradiction. Step 3: Determine entailment. Entailment refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one requires the truth of the other. Since the scenarios presented in the two sentences contradict each other, we can conclude that there is no entailment between these two sentences. If the second sentence was entailed by the first, it would mean that both sentences are saying the same thing, or that the second sentence could be conclusively deduced from the first one.

Cheryl's parents were together for more than a decade but never married; they separated when she was eleven years old. At the age of seven, Cheryl appeared in a television advert for British Gas. In 2004, Girls Aloud released a cover of The Pretenders' \\"I'll Stand by You\\" as the official single for the BBC's charity telethon Children in Need. In 2007, the group announced a joint release of Aerosmith and Run DMC's \\"Walk This Way\\" with Sugababes as the official single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief. The song was recorded at Comic Relief co-founder and trustee Richard Curtis' request. In March 2009, Cheryl climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief. The climb, organised by Gary Barlow, was also undertaken by fellow Girls Aloud member Kimberley Walsh, as well as Alesha Dixon, Fearne Cotton, Denise Van Outen, Chris Moyles, Ben Shephard, Ronan Keating and Barlow himself.

To change those Legos into building blocks, you use a magic wand. This is similar to type casting in Python! Type casting means changing one kind of information into another kind. For example, sometimes we have a number written like \\"12\\" instead of 12, but we need it to be a real number to do some math. We use type casting to make that change! In Python, there are some simple words to do this magic. They are called int(), float(), and str(). Here's how to use them: 1. To turn words into a number: \`int(\\"12\\")\` will become 12. The \\"int\\" word tells Python to change it to an integer (a whole number). 2. To turn words or numbers into decimals: \`float(\\"7.2\\")\` will become 7.2. The \\"float\\" word means a number with a decimal point. 3. To turn numbers into words: \`str(21)\` will become \\"21\\".

Today, I want to tell you a fun story about something called photosynthesis. It's something that plants do, and it's really important! Child: What's photosynthesis? Well, photosynthesis is a special process that plants use to make their food. They need sunlight, water, and a thing called carbon dioxide, which we breathe out. Child: How do they make food? You see, plants have tiny parts called chlorophyll inside their leaves, and they're green. When sunlight hits the leaves, chlorophyll captures the light's energy. They use that energy, along with water and carbon dioxide, to make a kind of sugar, which is their food. Child: Wow! So, plants eat sugar? That's right! The sugar they make is called glucose, and it helps them grow. They also release something called oxygen, which is really important for us because we need it to breathe. Child: That's cool! So, plants help us breathe? Absolutely! When plants make food through photosynthesis, they release oxygen into the air, and we breathe it in. So, plants and humans help each other. We give them the carbon dioxide they need, and they give us the oxygen we need. Child: I like plants! They're helpful! Yes, they definitely are!

Your goal is to complete the story by selecting the sentence that makes the story sound fully coherent. Steps to complete the task: 1. Begin by carefully reading the provided sentences of the story. Sentence1: May was a shelter cat the pet store took in for adoption day. Sentence2: Cathy and her family visited the pet store on adoption day. Sentence3: Cathy fell in love with May as soon as she saw her. Sentence4: After applying to adopt May and being approved, Cathy adopted May. 2. Read and analyze both sentence choices: (A) May and Cathy got along greatly. (B) May went outside and Cathy never saw her again. 3. Evaluate which sentence choice fits best in the context of the story. Consider the coherence and flow of the story when making your selection. In this case: - Sentence (A) \\"May and Cathy got along greatly\\" is a logical continuation of the story as it shows a positive outcome after Cathy adopts May. - Sentence (B) \\"May went outside and Cathy never saw her again\\" seems less coherent and does not fit the positive theme of the story, as they just adopted May and it seems unlikely that she would disappear immediately after. 4. Based on your analysis, select the sentence that best completes the story. In this case, sentence (A) is the best choice as it maintains the coherent flow and theme of the story.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Xi province started sustainable agriculture and permaculture 40 years ago, while Huan province still uses conventional methods of cultivation. Animals grazing the fields extensively lead to desertification, the loss of carbon and nitrogen in the soil, and other problems. Permaculture was beneficial in Xi province, they re-built 10 inches of top soil in 10 years which is 6 times faster than the natural rate, which lead to a more diverse ecosystem and more biodiversity. Which province experienced less dust storms? Answer:","response":"Xi province experienced less dust storms due to the implementation of sustainable agriculture and permaculture, which helped rebuild topsoil and increase biodiversity."},{"question":"MSC Cruises Topics Page The line is offering seven-night voyages to Canada and New England for as little as 429 per person.

A billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Apple is expected to continue after a 65-year-old Massachusetts business consultant read about the plaintiffs' floundering case online and volunteered to represent consumers in the suit. A federal judge said she was tentatively satisfied with a proposal to add Barbara Bennett the new named plaintiff in the lawsuit over Apple's iTunes software and the price of its iPods. The case actually started with three plaintiffs suing Apple nearly 10 years ago, but two of them withdrew and the judge disqualified the last one, Marianna Rosen, on Monday amid indications that Rosen didn't herself purchase any of the affected iPods during the time frame covered by the suit. But serial numbers show plaintiff OPTIONS: - Apple's iPod was bought in July 2009 - Barbara Bennett's iPod was bought in July 2009 - Court's iPod was bought in July 2009 - Marianna Rosen's iPod was bought in July 2009 - Massachusetts's iPod was bought in July 2009 - Rosen's iPod was bought in July 2009 - Steve Jobs's iPod was bought in July 2009 - iPods's iPod was bought in July 2009 - iTunes's iPod was bought in July 2009","response":"But serial numbers show plaintiff Barbara Bennett's iPod was bought in July 2009. This addition supports the passage as it clarifies that Barbara Bennett, the new named plaintiff, did in fact purchase an iPod within the specified time frame of the lawsuit. This information is relevant to the case as it establishes her eligibility to represent consumers in the class-action lawsuit against Apple over the company's iTunes software and the price of its iPods. Providing this information also helps to distinguish Bennett's involvement in the case from the disqualified plaintiff, Marianna Rosen, who was removed due to her lack of purchases within the time frame covered by the suit. Overall, the most logical choice to complete this passage is the one that shows the new plaintiff's clear connection to the case and her valid standing within the lawsuit."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Jon's back ached. Frost had come early this year and the ground broke like stone. Jon had spent eight seasons breaking this ground to plant spring's crops and every year it got harder. Sweat beaded on his brow and he felt his cotton shirt stick to his skin under his coat. Jon took off his soft-brimmed hat and wiped his forehead. He examined the hat as he let his breath return. The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth. Daven ran over the hill and down the cart path leading to their small cobblestone house. The boy had only left a short while ago and he held no sack with the bread and cheese his mother had told him to buy. Jon furrowed his brow. The boy continued to run and soon the wind carried his cry to his father's ears. \\"Papa! A carriage is coming! Two horses!\\" Jon's furrowed brow remained. Surely the boy meant a cart from a neighboring farm. No carriage made it out this far. \\"It's from the city! A soldier drives it!\\" Jon felt ice water flow over him. He turned to the house. \\"Sandra! Get the musket out of the pantry!\\" Jon saw his wife's face appear at one foggy window. Jon gestured wildly at her. \\"Get it!\\" They were too late.

Spanish:","response":"\\"en pecado me concibió mi madre\\" (Salmo 51,5), donde se refiere al hecho de que sus padres y familia no querían que él naciera. Esta frase, tomada del Salmo 51 en la Biblia, expresa la idea de que el salmista, en este caso el rey David, reconoce su condición pecadora desde el mismo momento de su concepción, lo cual es una expresión de humildad y una admisión de la naturaleza humana propensa al pecado. Al relacionarlo con el contexto que mencionas, se puede entender que David está hablando también de que su familia no deseaba o no tenía intenciones de que él naciera, lo cual podría haber contribuido a su percepción de sí mismo como alguien que lleva el pecado desde el inicio de su existencia. Es importante recordar que los Salmos son una colección de canciones y poemas que, aunque están basados en experiencias personales, también pueden ser interpretados de una manera más general y simbólica. En este caso, el Salmo 51 es considerado una oración de arrepentimiento, en la cual David pide perdón a Dios por sus pecados y busca la purificación y la renovación espiritual. La mención de su concepción en pecado es una forma de reconocer su necesidad de la gracia y el perdón divino. En el contexto de la interpretación que proporcionas, también podría entenderse como una percepción por parte de David de que su situación familiar dificultó su vida, pero al final, su relación con Dios fue capaz de superar esos obstáculos y encontrar consuelo y guía espiritual."},{"question":"Is \\"At the west end of the zone inside a grade II listed building is the Pannier Market that was completed in 1959 – pannier meaning \\"basket\\" from French, so it translates as \\"basket market\\".\\" a good answer to the question \\"In what year was Pannier Market finished?\\"","response":"Yes, the given information \\"At the west end of the zone inside a grade II listed building is the Pannier Market that was completed in 1959 – pannier meaning \\"basket\\" from French, so it translates as \\"basket market\\".\\" answers the question \\"In what year was Pannier Market finished?\\" as it explicitly states that the Pannier Market was completed in 1959.

Brett didn't want Christopher to teach him English because Available choices: -- Brett was very bad with grammar and spelling. -- Christopher was very bad with grammar and spelling.","response":"I choose the story that continues with: Christopher was very bad with grammar and spelling. Step 1: Consider the implications of the chosen story. Choosing this option suggests that the reason Brett doesn't want Christopher to teach him English is that Christopher himself struggles with grammar and spelling. This story would likely revolve around the challenges of learning from someone who is not proficient in the subject they are teaching, the potential frustration that arises, and the importance of seeking out a qualified teacher. Step 2: Develop the story. In this story, Brett recognizes that Christopher is not the best person to teach him English due to his own struggles with grammar and spelling. Brett may feel that learning from someone with limited proficiency could hinder his own progress and even instill bad habits. Step 3: Continue the story. As Brett and Christopher try to navigate through their English lessons, tensions rise as they continuously run into obstacles caused by Christopher's inadequate grammar and spelling skills. Brett starts to feel like he is not learning anything valuable from these sessions and longs for a qualified teacher. Step 4: Introduce a solution or resolution. Realizing that he cannot continue learning from Christopher, Brett decides to seek out other resources to learn English. He finds a local tutor who is well-versed in grammar and spelling. As Brett begins his lessons with this new tutor, he quickly realizes the positive impact a skilled teacher can have on his learning experience. Step 5: Conclude the story. Although Brett feels immense gratitude towards Christopher for his willingness to help, he understands the importance of learning from someone proficient in the subject. Both Brett and Christopher learn a valuable lesson about the importance of having a strong foundation in whatever they teach or learn, and they both continue to improve their English skills through qualified guidance and dedicated practice."},{"question":"Question: Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"I buy milk and put it in the fridge.\\" - Sentence B: \\"I buy paper towels and put them in the fridge.\\" Please answer this question gradually:","response":"To answer this question, let us analyze each sentence and compare them against one another. Sentence A: \\"I buy milk and put it in the fridge.\\" - In this sentence, the action and the context seem logical. Milk is a perishable item that requires refrigeration to maintain freshness and prevent spoilage. Therefore, putting milk in the fridge after buying it makes sense. Sentence B: \\"I buy paper towels and put them in the fridge.\\" - In this sentence, the action and the context seem somewhat unusual. Although buying paper towels is a normal action, putting them in the fridge isn't a typical or necessary practice. As paper towels do not require refrigeration, storing them in the fridge is not a logical thing to do. Comparing the two sentences, Sentence B (\\"I buy paper towels and put them in the fridge.\\") is the one that doesn't make sense, given that refrigeration is not a necessary or logical step in the storage of paper towels."},{"question":"What are the best habits to have?

Fact 2: Bighorns have hollow hair that traps body heat. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What do bighorns' hollow hairs do?\\" with the following options: - It helps them survive - Plant growth is reduced - prevent heat loss - share properties - protect them - allow growth - Decrease bodily water - refract or absorb. Answer:","response":"Bighorns' hollow hairs play a crucial role in their survival and protection against harsh environmental conditions. These specialized hairs act as efficient insulators, helping bighorns prevent heat loss from their bodies. By trapping body heat within the hollow structure of the hair, bighorns are able to maintain their body temperature and conserve energy that they would otherwise have to expend to generate heat. Adaptations like hollow hairs are particularly important for bighorns since they inhabit regions with extreme temperature fluctuations, such as high-altitude mountain ranges and arid deserts. Their hollow hairs serve as an essential biological adaptation that enables them to withstand these challenging environmental conditions, providing an insulative barrier to help maintain their core body temperature. In summary, out of the given options, the hollow hairs of bighorns primarily serve to prevent heat loss and protect them from the harsh environments they inhabit. This biological adaptation helps them survive and adapt to extreme climates by conserving energy and maintaining their body temperature effectively."},{"question":"Incredible parish!

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Question: Who's immigration agenda has funding for limited parts of it? === The answer to the above question is A:","response":"President Donald Trump's immigration agenda has funding for limited parts of it in the 1.3 trillion spending plan passed by the U.S. House.

Movie title: BiÄe skoro propast sveta Movie plot: A mentally challenged girl is defended by a young man who takes care of pigs. He gets into a fight with the local saloon keeper, prompting the man to get the boy drunk and bribe a priest into marrying the boy to the unfortunate girl. A female teacher arrives in town to teach women how to paint. She uses the young boy as a model and then as a toy for her pleasure. The teacher subsequently takes another lover and abandons the young man, claiming that she was unaware of his marriage. The young boy eventually kills his wife, but his father takes the blame for the crime and confesses his sins before he dies in prison. As a conclusion to this sad movie, the townspeople punish the young boy for what he has done. The answer to this question is:","response":"The teacher taught women how to paint."},{"question":"John, King of England In the 1940s, new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on research into the record evidence of his reign, such as pipe rolls, charters, court documents and similar primary records. Notably, an essay by Vivian Galbraith in 1945 proposed a \\"new approach\\" to understanding the ruler. The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians. Interpretations of Magna Carta and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between \\"partisan\\" factions. There has been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies. Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by Lewis Warren, suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed. Q: Who suggested that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than previously supposed?","response":"Sean Duffy, an expert in Irish medieval history, suggested that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than previously supposed.

An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland. At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth. - The City of Sunderland is a local government district of Tyne and Wear, in North East England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, and a range of suburban villages. - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines. - A simple suspension bridge (also rope bridge, swing bridge (in New Zealand), suspended bridge, hanging bridge and catenary bridge) is a primitive type of bridge that is supported entirely from anchors at either end and has no towers or piers. However, it may have saddles. In such bridges, the deck of the bridge follows the downward and upward arc of the load-bearing cables, with additional light ropes at a higher level used to form a handrail. Alternatively, stout handrail cables supported on short piers at each end may be the primary load-bearing element, with the deck suspended below. Suspended well from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward catenary arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads. Owing to practical limitation in the grade (i.e. the deck being an arc, not flat) and the response to dynamic loads of the bridge deck, this type is quite restricted in its load-carrying capacity relative to its span. This type of bridge is considered the most efficient and sustainable design in developing countries, however, especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges. - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Rebar (short for reinforcing bar), collectively known as reinforcing steel and reinforcement steel, is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. Rebar's surface is often patterned to form a better bond with the concrete. - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms and how they integrate with natural or man-made features. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England. - A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 19th century. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world. - Reinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in compression), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning. For a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least: - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands. - A footbridge (also called a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed for pedestrians and in some cases cyclists, animal traffic, and horse riders, instead of vehicular traffic. Footbridges complement the landscape and can be used decoratively to visually link two distinct areas or to signal a transaction. In many developed countries, footbridges are both functional and can be beautiful works of art and sculpture. For poor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and markets, which would otherwise be unreachable when rivers are too high to cross. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructible in such rural areas using only local materials and labor. - A polymer (Greek \\"poly-\\", \\"many\\" + \\"-mer\\", \\"parts\\") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play an essential and ubiquitous role in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Kingsgate Bridge is a striking , modern reinforced concrete construction footbridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England . It is a Grade I listed building . It was personally designed in 1963 by Sir Ove Arup , connecting Bow Lane on the historic peninsula in the centre of Durham to Dunelm House on New Elvet ( to which building Arup 's studio also contributed ) , and opened in 1966 . Kingsgate Bridge is thought to have been one of Arup 's favourite designs of all , he having spent many hours working on every detail of the plans . Its construction was unusual . The two halves were each built parallel to the river , then rotated through 90 ° to make the crossing . The meeting point of the two halves is marked by a simple bronze expansion joint . In 1965 , the bridge was the winner of the Civic Trust Award . In 1993 , it won Certificate of Outstanding Performance ( Mature Structures Category ) of the Concrete Society . A bust of Arup , cast in resin , was installed on the side of Dunelm House , the students ' union building adjacent to the bridge , in September 2011 . The sculpture is a copy of a 1987 bust by Diana Brandenburger , held by the National Portrait Gallery . It is a replacement for a previous copy of the same bust , in bronze , which was unveiled by Karin Perry , Arup 's daughter , on 16 April 2003 , the 108th anniversary of Arup 's birth , but which was stolen from its plinth during the summer of 2006 . During a university RAG Week in the early 1960s students suspended a car beneath the bridge . In February 1998 , the Durham Union Society president , Tom Joyce , fell through the bridge , but caught himself and was uninjured . - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. What is the relationship between 'kingsgate bridge' and 'county durham'? The answer to this question is:","response":"Kingsgate Bridge is a modern reinforced concrete construction footbridge across the River Wear, located in Durham, which is a city within County Durham in North East England. The bridge was personally designed in 1963 by Sir Ove Arup and opened in 1966. It connects Bow Lane on the historic peninsula in the center of Durham to Dunelm House on New Elvet.

Which one is it? Options: - Sentence A: \\"The people all laughed after they saw the disaster of 911\\" - Sentence B: \\"The people all cried after they saw the disaster of 911\\" Let's reason step by step:","response":"First, let's analyze each sentence's context and evaluate their sensibility. Sentence A: \\"The people all laughed after they saw the disaster of 911\\" - This sentence suggests that people laughed in reaction to the disaster of 911, which was a tragic event that caused significant loss of life and destruction. Laughter is generally considered an inappropriate response to such a tragic event. Sentence B: \\"The people all cried after they saw the disaster of 911\\" - This sentence suggests that people cried in reaction to the disaster of 911. Crying is a normal emotional response for many people when faced with a tragic event, such as the 911 disaster. After having analyzed each sentence, we can conclude that Sentence A is nonsensical, as it suggests an inappropriate and highly unlikely emotional response to a tragic event like the 911 disaster."},{"question":"Having just quit a highly moneymaking job with tech giant Microsoft in the United States,where he'd made millions working as a program manager, _ What Awuah wanted was to create a university in his native Ghana.a state-of-the-art education centre that would help educate the country's next generation of leaders.Awuah moved with his family,back to Ghana.There,he invested his own money and with the help of other donors he founded Ashesi University. \\"Africa needs to have a renaissance ,\\" says Awuah as he explained what drove him to take the risky decision.\\"The world needs to change in this way and I strongly believe that people like me need to be part of the solution;I need to be really actively involved in helping to drive this change in Africa'' Located about an hour's drive from the capital Accra,Ashesi,which appropriately translates to \\"beginning,\\" is the first Ghanaian university to combine technical majors with a liberal arts approach.Its campus,set on 100 acres in a town called Berekuso,was designed to be inspiring for the more than 500 young Ghanaians studying there. \\"So when I look at universities I see Africa fast--forward 30 years.When this 20-year-old is now in his or her 50s,that person is going to be a leader.\\" Today Ashesi,which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year,offers degrees in business, information systems and computer science.There are plans to offer engineering and economics majors in the near future.The school's graduation rate is between 70%and 90%,according to Awuah.

Tech entrepreneurs and endurance athletes Sami Inkinen, 38, and Meredith Loring, 34, hope to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary as the first couple to row from California to Hawaii. In coming days, the San Anselmo residents - he is a co-founder of the real estate search and information site Trulia - will set off on a 2,400-mile journey from Monterey to Oahu.

In 1976, Patrick Quesnel rowed from Washington state to Hawaii, and was followed in the 1980s by British racer Peter Bird. In 2008, Roz Savage became the first woman to row solo from San Francisco to Oahu in 99 days. \\"People have done things like this,\\" said Ray Dean, rowing commissioner of the San Francisco Dolphin Club. \\"I don't think it's crazy, but it is an aggressive challenge.

Inkinen (his name is pronounced SAH-me INK-in-en) grew up on a farm in Finland, has a master's degree in engineering physics from Helsinki University of Technology, and worked for a brief period as a radio chemist in a nuclear power plant in Finland. After selling his first wireless software company, Matchem, in 2000, he came to Stanford to earn an MBA, and while there he co-founded Trulia and became a competitive triathlete. Trulia, started in 2005, now has more than 400 employees and reported a record 50 million unique visitors to its site in April. Extreme challenge Inkinen said he was drawn to triathlons because of the challenges of pushing himself to extremes. But he also loved tracking every aspect of his performance, from the quality of his sleep and meditation to his heart rate. The self-professed \\"data geek\\" has become one of the nation's top amateur triathletes in his age group. Loring grew up as a competitive gymnast in New Hampshire, studied economics and psychology at the University of Massachusetts and earned a master's from Babson College. She was a product manager for FactSet Research Systems, which sells software and analytic applications to investment banks, and moved to the company's San Francisco office in 2008. Soon after, she met Inkinen. Loring is a cyclist and runner, and in late May won the women's division of the Mount Everest marathon in Nepal, a race that is billed as the world's highest trail running event. \\"Both of us were looking for a new and difficult adventure that would push our mental and physical capabilities,\\" said Inkinen of the 2,400-mile row. Weather permitting, the two plan to set out this week from a marina near Monterey Bay Aquarium in their 20-foot-long, 5-foot-wide carbon fiber boat Roosevelt - named for the nation's adventuresome 26th president. The boat weighs 1,400 pounds unloaded, and 2,900 pounds fully loaded with food and gear. It has no engine and no sail, only a sliding seat and muscle power. There will be no support or chase boats, and the Roosevelt is not a part of the inaugural Great Pacific Race, where a dozen teams of rowers left Monterey on June 9 for Hawaii. \\"We have consulted with the Great Pacific Race organizers, but we are doing this as a solo expedition,\\" said Inkinen, who found inspiration in the best-selling book, \\"Unbroken,\\" the story of a World War II bombardier whose plane went down in the Pacific and survived 47 days on a tiny raft. 'Wild of the open ocean' Loring laughed dryly and said, \\"Somehow that was appealing to my husband.\\" \\"After I read the book,\\" Inkinen explained, \\"I realized neither one of us had experienced the wild of the open ocean. Then I started reading other books about what people have encountered on the ocean.\\" Early on in their marriage, the two made a pact to do \\"mental growth experiences\\" together. Loring noted that neither of them had done any rowing before this year. They have since trained at the Sausalito Open Water Rowing Center. Shirwin Smith, general manager of the Sausalito rowing center, has rowed for three decades and would never consider such a journey. \\"The longest I've spent rowing was six hours, and that was in a 35-pound shell, not a heavy boat like Sami and Meredith are going out in,\\" said Smith. \\"But they have gone about their training and preparation in a really disciplined way. They were super fit to begin with, but they came here to get the right form. They learned and practiced in the heaviest boats we have.\\" She added, \\"I remember how I'd wake up at 6:30 a.m. and I could see the two of them making their way up the shore at the upper end of Richardson Bay. They would be out there for hours.\\" Inkinen acknowledged, \\"We had zero rowing experience when we started. The last six months have been about strengthening specific rowing muscles and just getting used to rowing.\\" The two wanted to use the journey as a way to bring attention to a subject they both feel strongly about: the dangers of sugar. Inkinen was stunned years ago when he learned he was prediabetic. He made a study of what he was eating and found sugar hidden in nearly all processed foods. \\"I had always thought that diabetics were overweight or not active,\\" Inkinen said. \\"But the problem is that sugar is in everything, from bread to ketchup. It's like a poison to your body. That's why we're raising awareness to change this. The ultimate goal is to reverse or eliminate childhood obesity and Type 2 diabetes.\\" Any donations made to their campaign, called Fat Chance Row, will go to Dr. Robert Lustig's nonprofit Institute for Responsible Nutrition at UCSF. Lustig is a professor of pediatrics, a widely known antisugar crusader and author of a book called \\"Fat Chance.\\" Inkinen and Loring - she left FactSet in 2010 - also are launching their own sugar-free, protein-based packaged food called Native Life, not yet on the market. For their row across the Pacific, they plan to bring nuts and dried fish, meat, fruit and vegetables. Sleep in water-tight cabin They will have a desalinator to convert salt water into drinking water, a GPS system, emergency beacons and a radar system to warn other boats of their presence and detect oncoming vessels. The main difference between their boat and a traditional rowboat is that the Roosevelt has a water-tight cabin in one end, for sleeping and taking refuge from storms. The boat, made in England, was designed to right herself when capsized. \\"We just did a training session where we were in the cabin and had the boat capsized,\\" said Inkinen. \\"It was kind of like a merry-go-round motion. You see through the hatch that the ocean is rising above your cabin, though not coming in. It's a little scary, but now that we've gone through it, we know that as long as everything is closed, we will spin back around.\\" Loring added, \\"We've taken a lot of safety precautions. We know that we'll probably flip over at least once during the expedition. When we are on deck, we'll always be tethered to the boat, so if we go overboard, we won't be lost.\\" Taking all the precautions doesn't mean things can't go wrong. Just Wednesday morning, a kayaker on the same journey was stranded when his solar panel (used to charge his equipment) malfunctioned, and he had to be rescued by the Coast Guard. For their trip, Inkinen and Loring plan to take turns in the cabin and up on deck, with one rowing for two hours while the other sleeps for two hours around the clock. They will spend an hour on deck together each day, to reconnect, recap and strategize. They expect to travel about 2 knots per hour on average and reach Hawaii in 60 days. \\"We met in August 2008,\\" Loring said. \\"We married Aug. 20, 2010. Hopefully, we'll finish this before our four-year anniversary.\\" Inkinen said he likes not knowing what lies ahead. \\"I've gone through the pain of Ironman triathlons,\\" he said. \\"I've built a company. It's fun. But it's very stressful. I've faced adversity. I know that no one can make me give up - unless it gets too risky. So I'm confident, but this is a whole new thing. We don't know what the lessons will be.\\" As for the prospects of their marriage being intact when they reach Oahu, Loring said, \\"The fact we are doing this as a couple does make it much more fun. And much more risky.\\" ||||| To test marriage, fight against sugar and break records, we are rowing across the Pacific Ocean, 2400+ miles from San Francisco to Hawaii, completely unsupported. If all goes well and we'll continue rowing non-stop 24x7, we'll finish in about two months after our June 2014 launch. This will hurt and push us to the very limits, but the fight will be worth it. Picture News ||||| Tech millionaire and the wife he met on Match.com trying to be first couple to ROW the 2,400 miles from Monterey to Hawaii Sami Inkinen, 38, and Meredith Loring, 34, want to push themselves physically but also raise awareness of the evils of sugar consumption By Joshua Gardner An ultra-fit California couple intends to soon take their hardcore fitness lifestyle to the next level by rowing a boat 2,400 miles from Monterey to Hawaii. Tech entrepreneur Sami Inkinen, 38, and his former competitive gymnast wife Meredith Loring, 34, if they complete the grueling feat, will become the first couple to ever successfully make the trip across the mighty Pacific. But short of being scared to undertake a task only ever completed by a handful of adventure seekers, Inkinen and Loring are more afraid of what it may do to their relationship. Ultimate challenge: Sami Inkinen his wife Meredith Loring are pictured training for their Monterrey to Oahu trek across the Pacific in just a row boat 'It's going to be uncomfortable. We'll be sleep-deprived and hungry and sore, so it will be easier to cross boundaries that we don't want to cross,' Loring told SFGate.com. Her husband agreed: 'The mental side is going to be the most challenging. How we deal with ourselves and with each. But these are two people accustomed to pushing boundaries and coming out on top. Finland native Inkinen started the real estate website Trulia in 2005 while pursuing his MBA at Stanford. He also became a competitive triathlete during that time. Loring grew up competing in gymnastics in New Hampshire and after receiving a master's, she had a successful run with a company that sells software to investment banks. Their decision may not be so surprising when you learn they met on Match.com before making a kayaking date in Sausalito their first meeting. The excursion will mark their fourth wedding anniversary. Inkinen and Loring want to become the first couple to row from Monterey to Hawaii Fit: Inkinen is one of the world's greatest amateur triathletes in his age group and Loring recently won the women's division of a marathon in Nepal dubbed 'the world's highest trail running event.' The sporty couple had never rowed before they decided to cross the Pacific, but were very much in shape going into their new training Inkinen is one of the world's greatest amateur triathletes in his age group and Loring recently won the women's division of a marathon in Nepal dubbed 'the world's highest trail running event.' Currently, their focus is on rowing, though neither had any experience with the sport before the decided to make the trip. 'Both of us were looking for a new and difficult adventure that would push our mental and physical capabilities,' said Inkinen. 'The longest I've spent rowing was six hours, and that was in a 35-pound shell, not a heavy boat like Sami and Meredith are going out in,' said Shirwin Smith of the Sausalito rowing center. 'But they have gone about their training and preparation in a really disciplined way. They were super fit to begin with, but they came here to get the right form. They learned and practiced in the heaviest boats we have,' she said. Death to sugar: Their website Fatchancerow.org will track their progress and serves as a place where donors can give money to help with the couple's pet cause - ending the epidemic of world sugar consumption Their water-tight boat and cabin will come stocked with a desalinator that will allow them to safely drink seawater. They'll also have all the food they'll need, a GPS system, emergency beacons, and a radar system to warn them of oncoming boasts. Several others have made the trip from West Coast of America to Hawaii in a row boat. A man made the trip from Washington state in 1976 and another did the same in the 1980s. Roz Savage was the first woman to row from San Francisco to Oahu, and did it in 99 days. For their chosen route, the record is 64 days, set by Mick Bird in 1997. 'I don't think it's crazy, but it is an aggressive challenge,' Ray Dean of the San Francisco Dolphin Club told the SFGate.com. 'The mental strain is hard to imagine. It's like living locked in your car and you can't get out. 'It's a little boat in a very big ocean.' ||||| Meredith Loring Meredith grew up as a competitive gymnast in New Hampshire, made her career in Wall Street in New York, until she migrated to California. Before breakfast, she has typically completed a three-hour run, five-hour bike ride or both. She has completed several multi-day cycling and running stage races both in U.S. and Europe. Meredith’s passionate about spreading the message about real foods based nutrition to the masses. She's also building a healthy packaged food company that has nothing to do with sugar. Her idea of a first over-night date with her now-husband was to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa. Proof of concept: Carried a steel mountain bike around Mt. Annapurna over a 19,000ft mountain pass in Nepal in a week, after her husband sold the trip as a fun cycling tour. Expedition mantra: I can do one more. ||||| Summary:","response":"Sami Inkinen and Meredith Loring, both tech entrepreneurs and endurance athletes, aimed to be the first couple to row from California to Hawaii in celebration of their fourth wedding anniversary.

During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity. Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere.

It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later.

On July 29, 2010, a young Mexican migrant showed up to work at a Louisiana sugar cane plantation. He worked one day and then complained of fatigue, shoulder pain and numbness. By August 3 he’d been sent to a New Orleans hospital. When he developed a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, doctors thought he might have encephalitis, or maybe meningitis. He didn’t. Doctors tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes, arboviruses, Lyme disease, autoimmune neuropathies and all came back negative. Meanwhile, the 19-year-old was deteriorating. When he had trouble breathing, doctors placed a tube down his throat to help. Vampire bats are out for blood: Here's how they find it Despite “True Blood’s” Louisiana setting, nobody thought of vampire bats because there are no vampire bats in the United States outside of zoos. But the young man had only just arrived in the United States. As an investigation later discovered, he had been bitten on the heel of his foot on July 15 while sleeping back home in Michoacán, a state in Mexico’s southwest. The bat had transmitted rabies, a common complication from vampire bat bites in central and South America. Doctors did begin to suspect rabies — and the state’s public health office was duly notified, but it wasn’t until August 20 that rabies tests came back positive. He died on August 21. Every person who had been in contact with him had to be found and notified. Some who had shared drinking vessels with him, for example, could have caught the disease. But according to CDC, so far there is no evidence anybody did. ||||| U.S. health authorities have announced the first death by a vampire bat in the United States. According to the AFP, on July 15, 2010, a 19-year-old man was bitten by a vampire bat in Michoacan, Mexico. Ten days later, the migrant farm worker left for the U.S. to pick sugar cane at a Louisiana plantation. He fell sick, presenting symptoms of fatigue, shoulder pain, numbness in his left hand and a drooping left eye. MSNBC.com writes, \\"Despite 'True Blood’s' Louisiana setting, nobody thought of vampire bats because there are no vampire bats in the United States outside of zoos. But the young man had only just arrived in the United States.\\" Tests later confirmed that he was infected with rabies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently wrote, \\"This case represents the first reported human death from a vampire bat rabies virus variant in the United States.\\" According to the CDC, the victim had a notably aggressive form of rabies. There have been 32 human rabies cases reported to the CDC since 2000. According to the CDC, \\"Although vampire bats currently are found only in Latin America, research suggests that the range of these bats might be expanding as a result of changes in climate. Expansion of vampire bats into the United States likely would lead to increased bat exposures to both humans and animals (including domestic livestock and wildlife species) and substantially alter rabies virus dynamics and ecology in the southern United States.\\" Reports suggest that other animals are and will continue to be affected by climate change -- how that will impact humans remains to be seen. NPR recently asked if climate change could be \\"making the nation's bears hungry.\\" Vampire bats made news earlier this week when researchers reported that these bats are able to find blood through a heat-detecting molecule covering nerve endings on their noses. According to ScienceDaily, once an adult vampire bat has found a vein to feed on, it can drink half of its body weight in blood. Although they may be feared, killing bats is not the answer, and the CDC writes, \\"the elimination of vampire bats to prevent human or animal rabies remains controversial.\\" A deadly disease, white-nose syndrome, has killed over one million bats of different species in the past five years.

To answer this query, let's delve into the different aspects and stages of an operation and how the phrase \\"Only the start of the operation\\" might fit into the context of the entire process. An operation, whether it's a business process, a project, or a scientific experiment, typically consists of various stages, including planning, execution, monitoring, and evaluation. Each stage contributes to the overall success and effectiveness of the operation, and overlooking any of them can result in suboptimal outcomes or even failure. With that said, let's break down these stages briefly: 1. Planning: This stage is where the goals, objectives, and overall direction of the operation are established. Extensive research, analysis, and preparation of resources take place to ensure that a well-constructed plan is in place. At this stage, team members, stakeholders, and decision-makers identify potential challenges and risks, set a project timeline, and allocate necessary resources. 2. Execution: This is the implementation phase of the operation, where plans are put into action. Teams work together to carry out their assigned tasks, and any changes or adjustments are made as needed. Collaboration, communication, and adaptability are vital during this phase, as unanticipated challenges may arise that require a swift response. 3. Monitoring: During the execution phase, it's crucial to monitor the progress of the operation. Regular check-ins, milestones, and performance metrics help track progress, identify potential issues, and make data-driven decisions. Monitoring also involves comparing actual results with the expected outcomes to ensure smooth progress toward the objectives. 4. Evaluation: Upon completion of the operation, a thorough evaluation takes place. The purpose of this stage is to assess the overall effectiveness of the operation, identify any areas for improvement, and provide insights and lessons to be applied to future operations. This phase often includes gathering feedback from team members, analyzing key performance indicators, and reflecting on any unforeseen challenges that were encountered. Considering the above explanation, it's clear that each of these phases plays a significant role in the successful outcome of an operation. Therefore, stating that \\"Only the start of the operation\\" is representative of the entire operation would be an inaccurate assessment. In conclusion, operations are multifaceted processes with several distinct stages, each contributing to the overall success and effectiveness of the operation. While the start of the operation, specifically the planning stage, sets the foundation and provides direction, it is only one aspect of a much larger process. Thus, it is crucial to recognize and appreciate the complexities of operations and not reduce them to a mere beginning or a single statement."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

We have: 2891 * t - 1048660 = -15669 * t + 348177 - 171877 First, let's combine the numbers on the right side of the equation: 348177 - 171877 = 176300 Now we have: 2891 * t - 1048660 = -15669 * t + 176300 Next, let's move the term with 't' from the right side to the left side by adding 15669 * t to both sides: (2891 * t + 15669 * t) - 1048660 = 176300 Now we add 2891 * t and 15669 * t together: 18560 * t - 1048660 = 176300 Now, let's move the number -1048660 from the left side to the right side by adding 1048660 to both sides: 18560 * t = 176300 + 1048660 Now add the numbers on the right side: 176300 + 1048660 = 1224960 So now, we have: 18560 * t = 1224960 To find 't', we will divide both sides of the equation by 18560: t = 1224960 / 18560 Now let's do the division: t = 66 So, little buddy, the value of 't' is 66!

Surfman Theodore Meekins was on watch that evening of 11 October 1896. A hurricane had struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the tide was so strong that beach patrols had been canceled. Still, Meekins paid close attention to the horizon. This was the type of weather that could blow ships hundreds of miles off course. Offshore, the ship E.S. Newman was caught in the storm. The captain, whose wife and child were on the ship, feared the Newman would soon break up. He made the decision to beach his ship, then fired a signal, praying that someone onshore would see it. Meekins, whose eyes were trained to cut through rain and surf mists, thought he saw the signal, but so much spray covered the lookout windows that he could hardly make sure. Still, he took no chances. After summoning the station keeper, Captain Richard Etheridge, Meekins set off a coston signal, a signal made by using lamps of different colors. Together, the two men searched the darkness for a reply. A few moments later, they saw a flash of light to the south and knew a shop was in distress . Even before the return signal burned out, Etheridge had summoned his men and begun rescue operations. For the lifesavers, the rescue of the Newman was nothing unusual. Over the years, so many ships had off the Outer Banks that sailors called the region the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Noting the dangerous surf and wind conditions, Captain Etheridge quickly decided the surf boats would be impossible to control. Instead, he decided to use another way to help the survivors. The crew set off on the long journey down the beach to the scene of the wreck . Captain Etheridge hoped to fire a line from a gun to the ship's mast .

This approximation has an error of about one day per 3,300 years with respect to the mean tropical year. However, because of the precession of the equinoxes, the error with respect to the vernal equinox (which occurs, on average, 365.24237 days apart near 2000) is 1 day every 7,700 years, assuming a constant time interval between vernal equinoxes, which is not true.

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Some children are harshly criticized or ignored and have a tendency to develop low self esteem. Other people develop insecurity when they fail for the first time at something, or are in a new environment. Know how your insecurities develop, and what makes them worse, to handle them better. There are ways to change your perspective on yourself so that you can begin to feel good about yourself. However, it is a long process. The brain can grow and change long after our bodies reach their permanent size, a phenomenon called brain plasticity. This allows you to learn or to change your thinking patterns at any age. By changing your thoughts, you can ultimately change your behavior. You can do CBT by yourself or with a therapist. Keep in mind that, if you find any of the steps difficult, you should see a therapist who is knowledgeable about CBT to help you. The first step in CBT is to identify your thought patterns. Many people who have negative thoughts about themselves believe they are not worth very much, and they will also believe that there is little they can do to change the situation. You need to begin to change the way you think about yourself by first acknowledging how you feel. Being self aware can be difficult at first. Well meaning friends wishing to help you may just tell you to “get over it” and recognize your strengths. There’s more to it than merely making the decision to change. You should start a journal of all the thoughts you have a day, both positive and negative. Write down the situations that surrounded the event, what your feelings were, and how you handled the situation. This will help you examine your thought patterns over time so you can start changing the negative thinking. Be honest with yourself in the journal. You need to know all your different thoughts to get a full picture. The more honest you are, the more you can change your behavior. Be consistent. Write about everything that you think is important; or, everything that happened at work; or, everything that you worry will happen to your spouse when you’re gone travelling. Once you journal for a while, you should look back over what you've written. This way, you can achieve more objectivity in relation to your thoughts so you can accept them and come to terms with yourself. Try to remember how you felt when you wrote them, and instead of feeling ashamed or bad about your negative thoughts, accept them. Everyone has them and if you first accept them, you can start to change them. By allowing yourself to feel your negative thoughts, you can own them and begin to make changes. Once you recognize the thought pattern that is causing you to have low self esteem, you can begin to change the way you think. Once you journal all of your thoughts and feelings for a few weeks and accept your feelings as being valid, you need to examine your thoughts and start changing the way you think. Look over your journal, looking for common thought patterns. Find a common thread through some of your thoughts or choose a particularly harsh thought. Take that negative thought and try turn it around to something positive. For example, you were feeling bad because you got behind on an assignment at work. Instead of focusing on your short comings, think about all the times you achieved something great at work or pulled off a hard project. Think to yourself, \\"I can turn this around because I have a history of doing great work. I just need to focus and I will do amazing, just like on my other work.\\" You want to take things that you feel and make them into positive situations. Know it is okay to feel them, but acknowledge that there are more productive ways of seeing yourself that will help you feel better about yourself. Forgive yourself for past mistakes or events. There is no way to change the past, and you have to give yourself the opportunity to improve. Do you know the saying, “Dress for the job you want, not the job you have”? Treat yourself according to who you want to be, not who you were. It will be easier to become that person. Once you look over your activities, you may see that you miss out on certain situations because of your low self esteem. If you notice a pattern of behavior, such as refusing to go into certain social situations because of anxiety and negativity, you should start trying to move past these behaviors. Once you change the thought processes around these events, you can push yourself to enter into them without the worry that there will be negative consequences. For example, you often say no to going out with coworkers because you think they will find you boring and you will just make a fool of yourself. Instead of thinking this way, think about the positive things about yourself and what might come out of it. You have other friends who like you and enjoy your company, so you are interesting. You may also make some new friends and become closer to those at work. If you think of the possibilities of a situation instead of the horrible things that might happen, you might be able to think about yourself in a positive light as well. This type of thinking can take time to change. Learning new ways to think about yourself takes practice, but don’t be afraid to think positively about yourself. It may seem difficult at first, but if you keep acknowledging your feelings and recognizing your negative behavior, you can make small moves to change it. After a while, you will find yourself doing it more and more to the point where you have more positive thoughts in your day than negative. If you find yourself having a hard time with this process, you may need to see a therapist. CBT is aided by having a trained professional who knows the methods and might be able to see things about yourself that you may not. In CBT sessions, the therapist works in partnership with you as you work towards your goals.

The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \\"green village\\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things, and bought small pieces of the palace garden with money. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea because their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were.You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich time. Charles made John Flamsteed try to find _ .

Electric motors are widely used in various applications, ranging from household appliances, transportation, and industrial machinery to renewable energy generation. They work on the principles of electromagnetism and convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. Understanding the key components and working principles of an electric motor is fundamental to its operation and maintenance. The principal components of an electric motor include: 1. Stator: It is the stationary part of the motor, consisting of a laminated iron core and wound with insulated copper or aluminum wires. The function of the stator is to generate the magnetic field necessary for the motor's operation. 2. Rotor: The rotor is the rotating part of the motor, which is also made of a laminated iron core and usually has conductive bars or windings embedded in it. The rotor's main purpose is to produce a rotating magnetic field when current flows through it. 3. Bearings: Bearings facilitate smooth and low-friction rotation of the rotor within the stator while keeping them aligned during operation. They can be either sleeve bearings or ball bearings, depending on the motor type and application. 4. Shaft: The shaft is a mechanical component that connects the rotor to the load being driven by the motor. The shaft transfers the mechanical torque produced by the rotor to the external equipment. 5. End bells or end shields: These components provide structural support and serve as a housing for the bearings, ensuring that the rotor remains in the correct position relative to the stator. 6. Cooling mechanism: Electric motors produce heat during operation, and thus require cooling to maintain optimal temperature. Depending on the motor type, cooling can be accomplished through convection using cooling fans, air, or liquids such as water or oil. The working principles of electric motors can be explained through three key concepts: magnetism, electromagnetism, and electromagnetic induction. 1. Magnetism: The magnetic force exists between two magnetic poles - the north (N) and south (S) poles. Opposite poles attract each other, while similar poles repel. This force is utilized in electric motors to create motion. 2. Electromagnetism: When an electric current flows through a wire, it generates a magnetic field around the wire. This magnetic field becomes stronger as the current increases. By coiling the wire around an iron core, the magnetic field is amplified, creating an electromagnet. The direction of the magnetic field can be reversed by changing the direction of the current flow. 3. Electromagnetic induction: According to Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, a voltage is induced in a conductor when it is subjected to a changing magnetic field. This principle applies to both the stator and rotor windings in an electric motor. During the operation of an electric motor, alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) is supplied to the stator windings, generating a magnetic field that induces a voltage in the rotor windings. The voltage creates a current flow in the rotor, resulting in a magnetic field that interacts with the stator's magnetic field. Due to the interaction of these magnetic fields, the rotor experiences a torque that causes it to rotate. This rotation is then transferred to the load connected to the motor shaft, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy."},{"question":"In this task, you're given a statement and three sentences as choices.

That's not using assets to do Sara Lee's work the best.","response":"Part #1: Identifying the neutral choice Usage: A neutral choice that neither agrees nor disagrees with the statement. In this case, choice 2 is the neutral choice because the statement says \\"not redeploying assets,\\" while choice 2 says, \\"properly redeploying assets.\\" The statement implies that something is not being done correctly, while choice 2 asserts that it is being done correctly. This choice neither agrees nor disagrees with the statement, making it the neutral choice. Part #2: Understanding when one's correctness follows from another Usage: If choice X implies the correctness of choice Y, they're connected. For example, choice 1 and choice 3 in this case both express similar views, suggesting that assets are not being used in the best way to achieve Sara Lee's goals. If choice 1 is correct, the correctness of choice 3 follows because they both convey the same idea and vice versa. Part #3: Identifying when choices can't be correct simultaneously. Usage: If choices disagree, they cannot be correct at the same time. For example, choice 2 disagrees with choice 1 and choice 3. Because choice 2 states that assets are being redeployed correctly, it contradicts both choice 1 and choice 3, which suggest that assets are not being used optimally. It means choices 1, 2, and 3 can't be correct simultaneously, as choice 2 directly contradicts choices 1 and 3."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given inputs i and A, where i is an integer and A is a list.

However, it does not specify the year when the islands became dependent on Saint Helena. To answer the question, it is necessary to delve into the history of the islands concerned. Assuming the question is about the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, which are currently administered as dependencies of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, here's some information: Saint Helena itself was discovered by the Portuguese in 1502 and was strategically significant as a stopping point for ships during the era of the East India Company. Ascension Island was claimed by the British in 1815 to curtail any possible French attempt to free Napoleon Bonaparte, who was exiled to Saint Helena. The British garrison on Ascension was reduced in 1922, and administration of the island was transferred to the government of Saint Helena. Tristan da Cunha is an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean, consisting of the main island of Tristan da Cunha and the uninhabited islands of Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough. The islands were first discovered in 1506 by a Portuguese sailor, Tristão da Cunha, after whom they were named. However, the archipelago remained uninhabited until the 19th century. In 1816, the British declared Tristan da Cunha and its surrounding islands as dependencies of Saint Helena to act as a strategic outpost and prevent any possible French attack on Saint Helena. Thus, while the sentence in question does not answer when the islands were declared dependent on Saint Helena, historical context reveals that Ascension Island was declared a dependency of Saint Helena in 1922, while Tristan da Cunha and its surrounding islands became dependencies in 1816."},{"question":"Answer the following Q with stream of consciousness.

Nelson is making a herbarium and needs Justin's advice about pressing the leaves, because Possible answers: 1). Nelson has already done it.; 2). Justin has already done it.;","response":"3). Both Justin and Nelson are novices and want to collaborate on the project. Nelson approaches Justin with a genuine excitement about the herbarium project and hopes to not only get advice but also engage him in the process. The first step they need to do together is gather the materials required for pressing the leaves, such as heavy books, blotting paper or newspaper, fresh leaves, and a flat, hard surface. This is because having the necessary resources will make the process smoother and more efficient. The next step for Nelson and Justin is to share any knowledge they may already have about pressing leaves and discuss the best techniques. They may even look up tutorials or instructions online to ensure they have the most accurate information. This is important because learning from each other will enable them to approach the project with confidence and competence. Once they have had their discussion, Nelson and Justin can move onto selecting the leaves they want to preserve. They will want to choose fresh, healthy specimens without blemishes or tears to achieve the best results. After collecting their leaves, they will have to clean and dry them with care to reduce the risk of mold or other damage. This step is crucial because the condition of the leaves will determine the quality of the final product. The actual process of pressing the leaves calls for the use of blotting paper or newspaper, which must be placed between each leaf and then sandwiched between heavy books. Nelson and Justin will want to ensure that the leaves are evenly spaced and not overlapping to guarantee the optimal pressing. They should also think of periodically repositioning the books on the flat surface to evenly distribute the pressure. Taking these precautions allows for the leaves to be flawlessly pressed and dried. Finally, Nelson and Justin should practice patience and wait for at least two weeks to allow the leaves to dry thoroughly. To mount the leaves in the herbarium, they should handle them delicately with tweezers and attach them to the mounting paper using acid-free glue or tape. At this stage, they can also label the leaves with their names, collection details, and any other relevant information. In summary, Nelson and Justin's collaboration on the herbarium project is an excellent opportunity for mutual learning and growth. By gathering materials, discussing techniques, selecting and preparing leaves, pressing, and mounting them, they can create a beautiful and lasting herbarium together."},{"question":"Premise: He seemed somewhat 104 apathetic in the search, as though he expected no great results from it.

He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. Question: who stuck the needle in the boy's arm? Answer: Options are: i. the boy himself. ii. the boy's mom. iii. not enough information. iv. Doctor Brandenbury. Answer:","response":"iv.

Rick Santorum and Ron Paul are also looking to make noise in Saturday's vote. Some highlights: 9:51 p.m. The candidates are asked to make their case for the state of South Carolina. Ron Paul says he'll fight for people's liberty and freedom, while reducing government debt and spending. Newt Gingrich says he can bring \\"dramatic\\" and \\"deep\\" change to Washington, and he can beat President Obama through debates. He calls the incumbent \\"the most dangerous president of our lifetime.\\" Mitt Romney touts his understanding of the country's values, and says \\"this president is changing the very nature of America.\\" Rick Santorum says he is \\"a conviction conservative\\" who will make \\"a clear contrast\\" with Obama. He tells Republicans not to \\"settle for a moderate\\" (Hello, Mitt). 9:43 p.m. Ron Paul, the doctor, also weighs in on abortion. He says it's as much of an issue of morality as of law. Rick Santorum notes that Paul has often voted against the pro-life position. Paul says he wasn't thinking of Santorum when he spoke of abortion policy and tells him: \\"You are overly sensitive.\\" 9:36 p.m. Abortion comes up. Newt Gingrich says he accepts Mitt Romney's statement that he has changed his mind and now opposes abortion rights -- but his health care plan in Massachusetts had abortion provisions and some of his judges were pro-abortion rights. Romney says he doesn't appreciate having his integrity questioned and that Gingrich has distorted \\"Romneycare\\" and other aspects of his record in Massachusetts. \\"I am a pro-life person,\\" he says, and will pursue policies to protect the unborn when he is president. Rick Santorum piles on Romney, charging Romney's health care plan allowed for abortions. Romney notes he was pro-life in a state where \\"that wasn't easy.\\" Tells Santorum, \\"I appreciate your record; I hope you appreciate mine.\\" 9:35 p.m. Newt Gingrich says when he is president that he will drop Justice Department lawsuits against states that have their own anti-immigration laws. 9:25 p.m. An audience member asks the candidates whether they support \\"amnesty\\" for illegal immigrants. Newt Gingrich says he would send more troops to the border and would quicken the pace of deportations, but he also supports a \\"guest worker\\" program for people who have been in the U.S. for a long time. He says illegal immigrants would have to apply and prove they have strong community ties. Mitt Romney says \\"you build a fence\\" with more troops on the border and sanction employers who hire illegal immigrants; says current illegal immigrants, even those who have been here a long time, should go back to their countries and re-apply for residency in the U.S. Rick Santorum notes that Romney once backed \\"a pathway to citizenship,\\" just as Gingrich does now. Santorum says illegal immigrants have broken the law, and shouldn't be rewarded for that. 9:21 p.m. After a break, the candidates are asked their biggest regret. Newt Gingrich says his biggest regret is spending the early months as a \\"traditional\\" candidate, rather than an \\"idea-oriented\\" one. Mitt Romney wishes he had spent less time criticizing his opponents and more time on the \\"failures\\" of President Obama. Also: \\"I would work to get 25 more votes in Iowa. That's for sure.\\" Rick Santorum regrets nothing, saying he's honored to be in the \\"final four.\\" Ron Paul says he would work on his delivery. 9:11 p.m. Newt Gingrich blasts new proposals for new Internet copyright restrictions, saying it amounts to censorship and is being pushed by \\"the left\\" in \\"Hollywood.\\" Mitt Romney agrees with Gingrich -- on Internet censorship at least. So does Ron Paul. Rick Santorum said the proposals in Congress do \\"go too far,\\" but Internet piracy is a problem that needs to be addressed. Romney says he has the same immigration views he did when he ran for president in 2008 and agrees with Santorum as well. Ron Paul, who is from Texas, says \\"we're all against illegal immigration\\" but also says the U.S. should have \\"a more generous immigration policy.\\" 9:08 p.m. A colleague provides this update: Newt Gingrich paid 994,708 in taxes on 3,162,424 in adjusted income. That's about 31.6%. -- Mitt Romney said earlier this week that he pays about 15% because he has so much investment income. 9:06 p.m. The candidates are asked about losing business to China. Rick Santorum suggests cutting the corporate tax and repealing Obama regulations. 9:03 p.m. Mitt Romney is reminded that his father George Romney released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968. Will he follow his family's example? \\"Maybe,\\" Romney says. \\"I don't know how many years I will release.\\" It's a comment that draws hoots from some audience members. Romney repeats: \\"I'm not going to apologize for being successful.\\" 9 p.m. An audience member asks the candidates: When are you going to release your taxes? Mitt Romney says he will release his tax return when he completes it in April -- and \\"if\\" he is the nominee. Romney says the criticism of his refusal to release tax returns is an \\"attack\\" on his business success. Gingrich notes he has released his tax returns in the past hour -- and that if Romney has a problem with his taxes, Republicans need to know before he clinches the nominee. 8:56 p.m. Mitt Romney jumps into the Rick Santorum-Newt Gingrich kerfuffle, and says it illustrates that both are Washington veterans. He says it proves the need for an outsider in the White House, \\"someone who's lived in the real streets of America.\\" Romney also tells Gingrich he is exaggerating his accomplishments and that \\"you're mentioned once in Ronald Reagan's diary.\\" Gingrich tells Romney he prospered under policies he pursued. Romney tells Gingrich -- speaker of the House for four years -- he was in business for 25 years. \\"You're not going to get credit for 25 years,\\" he says. 8:49 p.m. After a break, Rick Santorum is asked about Newt Gingrich's suggestion that Santorum exit the race so that conservatives can unite against Mitt Romney. Not much, Santorum says: \\"Grandiosity has never been a problem with Newt.\\" Noting that he beat Gingrich in Iowa and New Hampshire, Santorum says: \\"These are not cogent thoughts.\\" Gingrich says he'll be the president who can bring the most change, citing his experience in the Reagan years and the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress. \\"You're right,\\" he tells Santorum. \\"I think grandiose things.\\" Santorum tells Gingrich he served with him, and Gingrich lacked discipline -- and, reaching way back into history, also criticized Gingrich for ignoring the check bouncing scandal in the House. Gingrich continues to trumpet his experience as \\"a rebel.\\" 8:31 p.m. An audience member triggers a long discussion with a brief question: Can \\"Obamacare\\" really be repealed? Really? Mitt Romney says he can use executive orders to turn some health care responsibilities to the states, but that is only the first step of repeal; he would seek full repeal by proposing a better system. Newt Gingrich says it can be repealed with a Republican president and GOP Congress, and says the health care system is \\"a total mess.\\" He bashes the provision that allows children up to age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance, but he says that is needed because they can't find jobs in the Obama economy. Rick Santorum -- who is running fourth in some South Carolina polls -- questions whether Romney can really repeal Obamacare because he instituted a similar heath care plan as governor of Massachusetts; he also bashes Gingrich for once backing a mandate that all Americans buy health insurance. Santorum says both foes played \\"footsies with the left\\" on this issue.\\" Romney says Santorum distorted details of his plan, and they go back-and-forth on various aspects of the Massachusetts health care plan. Gingrich, also criticized by Santorum, says he finds it \\"mildly amazing\\" that his opponent doesn't think he can debate Obama on health care. Gingrich says he helped defeat \\"Hillarycare\\" during the Clinton years. He and Santorum go at it over the individual mandate that Gingrich once backed. Ron Paul, upset after being left out of the discussion, notes that he is a physician. He also notes it will be hard to outright repeal Obamacare, but Congress can reduce its influence. Again says the key is less government. 8:24 p.m. The candidates are asked about veterans unemployment. Ron Paul says the government should help everybody, but notes that veterans need special medical help. Rick Santorum says he backs preferences for veterans because they have sacrificed for the country, and blasts President Obama for military cuts. Mitt Romney says states can also help veterans, and warns against expanding the federal government -- though he too blasts Obama for proposed military cuts, and starts talking defense policy. Newt Gingrich talks about the success of the GI Bill after World War II, and says the U.S. needs another \\"transition\\" system for veterans and improved economy for all Americans. 8:22 p.m. Rick Santorum weighs in on jobs, saying too many government programs are actually hurting working people. He stresses the need to rebuild the manufacturing sector of the economy and draws applause by citing South Carolina's potential. 8:17 p.m. Newt Gingrich is invited to specify his problems with Mitt Romney's work at Bain Capital. He says it strip-mined companies for their wealth and left them bankrupt, including two companies in South Carolina. Romney ignores the Bain criticism and says he wants to talk jobs; he accuses President Obama of crony capitalism. Pressed by John King about Bain, Romney says his company built businesses, created some 100,000 jobs and practiced capitalism. \\"My view is that capitalism works,\\" he says. He adds, \\"There's nothing wrong with making profits.\\" He gets applause for both statements. 8:14 p.m. The candidates are asked how to get people back to work. Ron Paul says government needs to \\"get out of the way,\\" including lower taxes. Newt Gingrich calls for repealing new federal business regulations and more domestic energy development. 8:12 p.m. John King asks the other candidates if Newt Gingrich's ex-wife's allegations are an issue. Rick Santorum says character is an issue; Mitt Romney says, \\"Let's get on with the real issues.\\" Ron Paul complains about the media -- but also notes he's been married 54 years. 8:08 p.m. Moderator John King gets right down to it, asking Newt Gingrich about his ex-wife's claims he once wanted an \\"open marriage.\\" Gingrich says no, and tells King that he is \\"appalled\\" he would the open the debate with such a question. He also says the topic is \\"trash\\" and \\"is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine.\\" King notes that ABC aired the report, and Gingrich yells back at him for repeating. Gingrich also says the story is \\"false\\" and reflects anti-Republican media bias -- all responses that get huge applause from the South Carolina crowd. 8:06 p.m. The candidates introduce themselves. Rick Santorum cities his \\"delayed\\" win in Iowa; Mitt Romney cites his marriage of 42 years (hello, Newt?); Newt Gingrich stresses his Georgia roots; Ron Paul emphasizes his experience, and the fact he is the only veteran in the race. 8:00 p.m. CNN is broadcasting tonight's debate and you know what that means: A long, over-produced opening segment, this one focusing on \\"the fight for the South.\\" There's also a playing of the national anthem. 7:50 p.m. The stage is set, after some last-minute changes; thanks to Rick Perry's departure today, there are only four lecterns: Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul. ||||| Here’s Washington Wire’s live blog of Thursday night’s GOP debate in Charleston, S.C., the last before Saturday night’s primary. It came on a day when Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropped out of the presidential race, leaving only four candidates on the stage: Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul. The debate got off to a tense start when Mr. Gingrich was asked by CNN moderator John King to respond to allegations by an ex-wife that he had asked for an “open marriage.” Mr. Gingrich chastised Mr. King for asking the question, calling the assertions and the media coverage “as close to despicable as anything I can imagine.” “The destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decide people to run for public office,” Mr. Gingrich said to rousing applause from the audience. “I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that.” Keep reading: ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Romney came out in much tougher fashion than he has in past debates, a few hours after he got into it with an Occupy protester at a campaign event. First, he delved into a previous question, about how to fix the economy, and called President Barack Obama \\"the biggest impediment to job growth in this country.\\" King then pressed him to \\"do the math\\" about how he arrived at the 120,000 jobs figure he says he created at Bain. He said he finds it \\"kind of strange on a stage like this with\\" GOPers to be debating this issue. He said the 120,000 came from four businesses in particular that Bain created, and that that figure is to date. \\"I'm very proud of the fact that i've worked throughout my career to create enterprises,\\" he said, adding of his support for capitalism and his feeling that Obama isn't for it: \\"We're gonna stuff it down his throat!\\" Read more about: South Carolina, Debates, 2012 Elections ||||| Story highlights Gingrich replies angrily to first question on ex-wife's allegations Santorum says Romney, Gingrich played \\"footsies with the left\\" Debate comes at end of one of the wildest days in a volatile campaign Romney has been front-runner but polls say his lead is fading The four remaining GOP candidates played to their individual strengths on Thursday and tried to leave a lasting impression in a final, boisterous debate two days before South Carolina's pivotal primary. In a campaign cycle where debates have had direct consequences on the ebb and flow of the race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich turned his contempt for the media into one of his strongest performances yet. When CNN Chief National Correspondent John King opened the debate with a question about open marriage, following an interview by Gingrich's ex-wife saying that he had sought one, the Republican chastised him. \\"To take an ex-wife and make it two days before the primary a significant question in a presidential campaign is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine,\\" Gingrich told King, the moderator of the debate. Gingrich's response elicited loud applause from the audience. The debate came at the end of a ground-shaking day that saw former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum being declared winner of the Iowa caucuses more than two weeks after his apparent second-place finish to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropping out of the race and throwing his support to Gingrich. Texas Rep. Ron Paul was the fourth candidate in the debate. An angry Gingrich chastised CNN for starting off with the question about his marriage. JUST WATCHED Santorum, Romney battle health care Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH GOP candidates asked to show their taxes 02:33 Hours before the debate, ABC News and The Washington Post released interviews with Marianne Gingrich in which she alleged Gingrich asked for an \\"open marriage\\" before their divorce. Marianne Gingrich told The Washington Post that a day after her husband told her about his affair with Callista Bisek in May 1999, the former House speaker delivered a speech titled \\"The Demise of American Culture\\" to a group of Republican women in Pennsylvania. \\"How could he ask me for a divorce on Monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people?\\" Marianne Gingrich said in her interview with the Post. Gingrich said the story was false. The three other presidential candidates on the stage passed on the chance to criticize Gingrich over the allegations by his ex-wife. Romney took the steady, cautious route that he has throughout the campaign, responding to his rivals only when attacked. Santorum presented himself as a more conservative option to Romney than Gingrich and as the candidate who could draw an effective contrast in the fall with President Barack Obama. As the debate was going on, Gingrich's campaign released his tax returns as he had promised to do earlier. Romney was asked if he would follow his father's lead in releasing 12 years of tax returns. Romney's father, George, ran for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. \\"Maybe,\\" Romney said, before highlighting his business experience and his personal success. \\"I didn't inherit money from my parents. What I have, I earned.\\" As he had earlier this week, Santorum said he filed his own returns and they were at home on his computer and he would release them once he returned home. Paul said he had no intention to release his returns, arguing that congressional financial statements are revealing enough. The issue of electability was hotly debated. Earlier this week, Gingrich called for both Perry and Santorum to drop out of the race and support his candidacy because they didn't have the experience for a large undertaking like a presidential campaign. With Perry gone, Santorum was left to respond. JUST WATCHED Romney explains Bain jobs 'math' Replay More Videos ...

While Gingrich and Santorum debated their records in Washington and specifically who was more responsible for the Republican Revolution of the 1990s, Romney raised his hand to argue it's time for a Washington outsider. \\"We need to send to Washington someone who has not lived in Washington, but someone who's lived in the real streets of America,\\" Romney said. Every candidate onstage said they opposed the anti-Internet piracy bill roiling Congress, and criticized the proposal for being too intrusive. However, both Romney and Santorum said they could support a more narrow law that would help protect intellectual property rights online. Displaying the off-the-cuff wit he has used to great effect at a series of GOP debates, Gingrich joked he was none too sympathetic to movie and music producers who pushed for the legislation. \\"You're asking a conservative about the economic interest of Hollywood,\\" Gingrich said to laughter in the audience. \\"And I'm weighing it, I'm weighing it. I'm not rushing in.\\" Meanwhile Paul touted his libertarian-leaning views, adding he had been an early detractor of the bill. He said as president he would be unique in his ability to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to protect civil liberties. The former obstetrician and gynecologist forced his way into the conversation on both health care and abortion, two issues he knows a lot about. \\"I thought maybe you were prejudiced against doctors and a doctor that practiced medicine in the military or something,\\" Paul told King after a section where the other three candidates answered a question on whether a full repeal of President Obama's health care reform was truly possible. After a lengthy debate among the other three candidates over the legitimacy of criticizing Romney's political conversion from pro-abortion rights to anti-abortion rights, the crowd booed and chanted Paul's name when King moved on without letting Paul weigh in. \\"John, once again, it's a medical subject and I'm a doctor,\\" Paul said. Four polls over the last two days show Romney's long-held lead in South Carolina nearly evaporating into single digits by the time the four took the stage, while Gingrich has surged into a virtual tie. Gingrich on Thursday grabbed a major endorsement when Perry announced he was backing Gingrich as he suspended his campaign. Santorum's campaign got a boost on Thursday when the Iowa GOP released the final certified results from its January 3 caucuses, which reversed Romney's eight-vote victory and instead determined that Santorum had won by 34 votes. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"In the final Republican debate before the South Carolina primary, the four remaining candidates discussed various issues including allegations from Newt Gingrich's ex-wife, releasing their tax returns, and their strategies for job creation and immigration.

This is a solemn fact on which young and old might frequently ponder with advantage, and on which we might enlarge to an unlimited extent; but our space will not admit of moralising very much, therefore we beg the reader to moralise on that, for him--or herself. The subject is none the less important, that circumstances require that it should be touched on in a slight, almost flippant, manner. Had Jack Robinson known what lay before him that evening, he would--he would have been a wiser man! Nothing more appropriate than that occurs to us at this moment. But, to be more particular:-- When the party reached the nets, Jack left them to attend to their work, and went off alone to the vats, some of which, measuring about six feet in diameter, were nearly full of fish in pickle. As he walked along the slight track which guided him towards them, he pondered the circumstances in which he then found himself, and, indulging in a habit which he had acquired in his frequent and prolonged periods of solitude, began to mutter his thoughts aloud. \\"So, so, Jack, you left your farm because you were tired of solitude, and now you find yourself in the midst of society. Pleasant society, truly!--bullies and geese, without a sympathetic mind to rub against. Humph! a pleasant fix you've got into, old fellow.\\" Jack was wrong in this to some extent, as he afterwards came to confess to himself, for among his men there were two or three minds worth cultivating, noble and shrewd, and deep, too, though not educated or refined.

Q: Middle school was rough for me because I was an overweight kid growing up in the 90s. I now teach middle school and have a firsthand look at how cruel today’s kids can be. My mom was skinny and didn’t understand the struggle, and never really taught me anything about being healthy. Instead, she would let my skinny little brother eat anything he wanted, and withheld food from me. I finally figured it out after high school and joined the gym, but to this day (I’m 32) I still battle with overeating and probably always will. I love to exercise, but since I struggle with my food intake, I am still an overweight person, but a physically strong one, and I do have an unhealthy addiction to weighing myself on the scale. Recently, I started involving my daughter in my home workouts, and I’ve been showing her how to make healthy choices. We go for light jogs together, or she will ride her bike with me while I jog at my pace, and we do step workouts to music and we play just dance on the switch. We do one of these activities every weeknight, and have been for about a month now. Today she asked me if she could get on the scale to see how much she weighs. I explained to her that it’s not about a number on the scale, but how you feel when your body can do things that you didn’t think it could do (even though I admittedly don’t take my own advice when it comes to this). She still wanted to weigh in. I let her. I’m worried that she will develop an unhealthy scale addiction like I have. I don’t want her to go through what I did, and I want her to be healthy. I know that it’s up to me to lay that foundation for her. I’m just unsure if I’m doing it in the right way. A:","response":"Part #1: Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation Usage: The anecdote provided above describes the author's struggle with being overweight, their relationship with their mother, their own experience with overeating, and their concern for their daughter's relationship with weight and health. This meets the criteria for a complex ethical situation as it involves multiple relationships, concerns, and potential consequences. Part #2: Identify who is wrong here. Usage: In this anecdote, the author themselves is worried they might be wrong by allowing their daughter to weigh herself and possibly develop an unhealthy scale addiction. Part #3: Classify each post into the following categories: AUTHOR, OTHER, EVERYBODY, and NOBODY. Usage: In this case, the response would be OTHER because the author's mom didn't teach them about being healthy and withheld food from them. The author is trying to teach their daughter a better approach to health by involving her in home workouts and making healthy choices, so the fault lies more with the author's mother for not providing a healthier environment for the author growing up. However, it's worth noting that there could be some debate around whether the author is also at fault for not following their own advice about focusing on overall health instead of a number on the scale."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - General Electric, often abbreviated as GE, is an American multinational conglomerate corporation incorporated in New York, and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

On a positive note, the user interface is clean and easy to navigate, which makes it quite effortless to locate the various functions within the app. The app does offer a variety of useful tools that are certainly helpful in some situations. However, there are a few drawbacks that I encountered while using the app. First, the performance can be fairly sluggish at times, which leads to frustrating delays and some crashes. In addition, there seems to be an issue with the app consuming a significant amount of battery life, causing my device to drain faster than usual. Lastly, the customer support for this app could be better. It seems they are slow to respond to queries or address user concerns, which can be quite disheartening.

Dan Rooney was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000 for his contributions to the game. He was credited with spearheading a requirement that NFL teams with head coach and general manager vacancies interview at least one minority candidate, which has become known as the \\"Rooney Rule\\". Rooney served as the United States Ambassador to Ireland, from July 2009 until his resignation in December 2012. On March 19, 2008; Rooney released wide receiver Cedrick Wilson from the Steelers, after he was arrested for punching his former girlfriend. However earlier that month, on March 8, Rooney failed to offer any type of discipline to linebacker James Harrison for slapping his girlfriend. When asked about the incident involving Wilson, Rooney stated that \\"the Steelers do not condone violence of any kind, especially against women,\\". However, he was then confronted about this by Ed Bouchette and Michael A. Fuoco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, who asked why Harrison was not punished for committing the same crime. Rooney said that the cases were different and stated that \\"I know many are asking the question of [why] we released Wilson and Harrison we kept. The circumstances--I know of the incidents, they are completely different. In fact, when I say we don't condone these things, we don't, but we do have to look at the circumstances that are involved with other players and things like that, so they're not all the same. What James Harrison was doing and how the incident occurred, what he was trying to do was really well worth it. He was doing something that was good, wanted to take his son to get baptized where he lived and things like that. She said she didn't want to do it.\\" Rooney later said that Harrison had no intention of harming his girlfriend when he went to her house to pick up his son. \\"The situation angered him. He didn't go there with intent.\\" Meanwhile, Rooney stated that the Wilson case was different. According to Rooney \\"[Wilson] knew what he was doing. He knew where his [former] girlfriend was and went to the bar looking for her. When he got there he punched her. That's different and I understand he expressed no regret. Afterwards Rooney was criticized by the Women's Center and Shelter of Pittsburgh as a result of his comments. ESPN's Matt Mosley later wrote that Rooney's attempt to \\"explain that Harrison's heart was in the right place ... had to be one of the worst Public Relations moments in club history.\\" what else did he state?","response":"Dan Rooney did not make any additional statements directly related to the incidents involving Cedrick Wilson and James Harrison in the provided context. The quotes mentioned in the question summarize his main points and reasoning behind the differing treatment of the two players. Rooney emphasized that the circumstances around each incident were different, and that he believed Harrison's intentions were not malicious, unlike Wilson's actions. Additionally, Rooney explained that Harrison was angered by the situation but did not go to his girlfriend's house with the intent of causing harm. It is worth noting that Rooney and the Steelers faced public backlash and criticism, particularly from the Women's Center and Shelter of Pittsburgh for attempting to justify Harrison's actions. The handling of these situations highlights the challenges that NFL teams face when dealing with off-field incidents and the potential consequences for their players. Dan Rooney's statements aimed to clarify the organization's stance on these matters, emphasizing that they do not condone violence, especially against women, although their actions in these particular situations may not have successfully communicated this message."},{"question":"What is the most logical next event?

This sentence is a more formally structured question with clear intent, aiming to check if a certain aspect or object is part of Italian heritage. It is direct, without any redundancy or hesitation.

Hence, the second sentence can be considered entailed by the first sentence. However, the second sentence represents a clearer and more straightforward way of expressing the same idea."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about steve wade -lrb- singer -rrb- can be gathered from the following bio?

Step 1: Understand the Head - PersonX accuses PersonY of cheating. This describes an event where PersonX is accusing PersonY of dishonest behavior (cheating). Step 2: Understand the Tail - to punish. This refers to an event or action with the purpose of penalizing someone for wrongdoing. Step 3: Assess the relationship between the Head and Tail events. In this case, the Head event (accusing someone of cheating) can potentially lead to the Tail event (punishment) if the accusation is proven and accepted by an authority figure or decision-maker.

She is planning on having 30 guests. For dinner she is making a recipe that makes 2 servings each. Each batch of the recipe calls for 4 potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt. A potato costs .10 and a container of salt costs 2 at the supermarket. If each container of salt has 5 teaspoons, how much money will Susan spend on food? A: 12 Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"To feed 30 guests with a recipe that makes 2 servings each, Susan needs to prepare 15 batches of the recipe (30 guests ÷ 2 servings per batch = 15 batches). For each batch, she needs 4 potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt. Thus, for 15 batches, Susan needs a total of 60 potatoes (15 batches × 4 potatoes per batch) and 15 teaspoons of salt (15 batches × 1 teaspoon of salt per batch). Each potato costs .10, so 60 potatoes will cost Susan 6 (60 potatoes × .10 per potato). Since each container of salt costs 2 and has 5 teaspoons, Susan needs 3 containers of salt to have enough for 15 teaspoons of salt (15 ÷ 5 teaspoons per container). The cost of the salt will be 6 (3 containers × 2 per container). In total, Susan will spend 12 on food (6 for potatoes + 6 for salt)."},{"question":"Answer the following question.

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Q: Background Paragraph: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]. Story: The island of Utopia is a popular tourist destination with its great sandy beaches. Two of the most popular beaches are beach A and beach B. Both beaches also have large wildlife sanctuaries where rare dolphins can be seen. There are some fisheries in both beaches too. This year the government of Utopia is looking for more sources to increase their revenue. They decided to allow sand mining in beach A next year, and earn some extra revenue. Question: In which beach fisheries might financially struggle next year, beach A or beach B? A:","response":"Beach A"},{"question":"2. figure out a money management system and stick to it. or you might discover you're out of money much before you expected. 3.

The tweet seems to respond to a post made by Rachel Maddow (@maddow), a television host, political commentator, and author. The exact content of Maddow's post is not available; however, given the user's response, it can be inferred that it was discussing a serious and controversial issue.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. I am facing a new situation today: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the other group? A:","response":"To answer this question correctly, let's break down the information provided and apply it to the two groups of soldiers. Step 1: Identify the key points from the background article. - Weight lifting exercises increase the size and strength of skeletal muscles. - Running exercises increase the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles. Step 2: Analyze the training programs of the two groups of soldiers. - Blue group: Did weight training for 3 months. - Brown group: Ran 3 miles a day for three months. Step 3: Compare the training programs to the key points from the background article. - Blue group's training (weight training) is geared towards increasing the size and strength of skeletal muscles, not specifically targeting cardiac muscle efficiency. - Brown group's training (running) is aimed at increasing the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles since running is an exercise that directly targets this muscle group. Step 4: Answer the question. Based on the information provided in the background article and the training programs of the two groups of soldiers, the group that didn't increase the efficiency of their cardiac muscle as much as the other group is the Blue group, as their training focused on weight exercises, which primarily target skeletal muscles and not the cardiac muscles."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is saved by their own stupidity?

The actress who appeared in a film about a superhero named Wade Wilson played what role in the series Firefly?","response":"The actress who appeared in a film about a superhero named Wade Wilson is Morena Baccarin. She starred alongside Ryan Reynolds in the Deadpool movies, based on the Marvel Comics character Wade Wilson, who becomes the irreverent and comedic antihero Deadpool. In the science-fiction television series Firefly, created by Joss Whedon, Morena Baccarin played the character Inara Serra. Firefly was set in the year 2517, in which humanity had spread out and colonized a new star system. The show focuses on the lives of a renegade crew aboard the spaceship Serenity as they navigate this complex, diverse universe while dealing with issues of morality, identity, and survival. Inara Serra, portrayed by Morena Baccarin, is a sophisticated and well-educated Companion, which in the Firefly universe is a highly respected and socially powerful profession similar to a courtesan. Companions are more than just sexual partners; they are highly skilled in numerous arts including diplomacy, counseling, and self-defense. Inara leases a shuttle from the spaceship Serenity for her business, effectively making her a member of the crew. Inara's role in the series is integral to the development of the plot and characters. She brings a different perspective to the crew's mostly rough-and-tumble, outlaw lifestyle. Her elegance and poise stand in stark contrast to the other members of the Serenity's crew, and her background gives her insight and understanding of the complex social structure inherent in the Firefly universe's interplanetary civilization. Throughout the show, there is a complex relationship between Inara and the ship's captain, Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds, played by Nathan Fillion. While they often clash due to their clashing moral values and differences in lifestyle, the characters share a deep respect for each other and a sexual tension that remains unresolved throughout the series. Firefly was unfortunately canceled after just one season, but it gained a cult following and later spawned a feature film called Serenity. The role of Inara Serra played by Morena Baccarin remains a beloved aspect of the series by fans and displays her versatility as an actress, which continues to be seen in her performance as Vanessa Carlysle in the Deadpool movies."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a four sentences of story written in natural language.

Kyle visits a local church soon after moving into town. Upon his visit, he develops an immediate liking to the atmosphere, particularly enjoying the music and the classes taught there. His decision to make this church his new place of worship implies that he may have a spiritual or religious inclination. While the text doesn't provide direct confirmation of Kyle being religious, his actions suggest a likely interest or participation in religious activities. He actively seeks out a church, interacts with the pastor, engages with the church's classes and sessions, and eventually commits to making this church his regular place of worship. However, one could argue that enjoying the music and classes does not necessarily imply a religious adherence; people sometimes attend church for the sense of community or for personal enjoyment. Therefore, while the inference that Kyle is religious is strong, it is not absolutely confirmed by the text provided. In conclusion, based on the information given in the text, it can be inferred that Kyle is likely religious, but the text does not explicitly confirm this. Therefore, the sentence \\"Kyle was religious\\" can be considered possibly true or likely true, but not definitively true based strictly on the provided text. Therefore, whether the statement is true or not fully depends on how strictly one interprets the requirement for explicit confirmation in the text, which the text does not provide in this case."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

This can be done by: 1. Assessing the extent of damage: Examine the wood to determine how much damage has been done. Look for areas with missing paint, discolored spots, or signs of rot. 2. Cleaning the affected area: Remove any dirt, debris, and loose paint from the surface of the wood using a stiff-bristled brush, soapy water, and a sponge or cloth. Rinse the area thoroughly with clean water and let it dry completely. 3. Sanding the wood: Lightly sand the damaged areas to remove any remaining paint and to even out the surface. Be sure to use a fine-grit sandpaper and gently sand in the direction of the wood grain. 4. Applying a wood filler (if needed): If there are deep gouges or holes in the wood, use a wood filler to fill them. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to properly apply and dry the filler. 5. Priming the wood: Apply a wood primer to the surface to seal any exposed wood grain and create a better surface for the paint to adhere to. Let the primer dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6. Repainting the surface: Once the primer is dry, repaint the wood using a high-quality exterior paint that is specifically designed for wood. Apply at least two coats of paint, allowing each coat to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. 7. Applying a protective sealant: To further protect the wood from rain and other elements, consider applying a water-repellent sealant. This will create a barrier that helps prevent water from seeping into the wood and causing further damage. By following these steps and regularly maintaining the wood's finish, you can prevent your wood from deteriorating and maintain its luster and appearance despite exposure to rain and other outdoor elements."},{"question":"Question: Where is evil Luthor incarcerated ?

Translate this to English?","response":"The legal and judicial security of private investments is one of the keys to the economic and social development of Africa. The concept of legal and judicial security of private investments refers to the level of protection, in terms of laws and regulations, that investors can expect when making investments in a country or region. This security can be seen as a major determinant in attracting private investments, which are essential for supporting economic growth and development. In the case of Africa, there are several reasons why the legal and judicial security of private investments is integral to the continent's overall economic and social progress. Firstly, in recent decades, African countries have experienced a significant increase in private investments, both domestic and foreign. This influx of capital has led to a rise in economic activity, which in turn has contributed to the creation of new jobs and opportunities for a growing population. A strong legal and judicial system can offer a level of stability that encourages further investment from businesses and individuals who may see the benefits of investing in the African market. Secondly, a well-established legal framework is integral to fostering transparency and confidence in government activities. By having defined rules and regulations governing foreign and domestic investments, governments demonstrate their commitment to creating a safe and stable environment for business operations. In turn, this helps to build trust among potential investors and the broader public. In addition to creating a more attractive investment climate, strong legal and judicial protections can also play a role in combating corruption and promoting good governance. Africa has long struggled with issues related to corruption, which can create uncertainty and complications for investors looking to conduct business on the continent. A strong legal foundation can help deter corruption, ensuring that investments are protected and used for the intended purposes of fostering economic growth and social development. Furthermore, a comprehensive legal infrastructure helps create a level playing field for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the backbone of many African economies. By providing these businesses with accurate information on investment regulations and protections, governments can help them thrive and make more informed investment decisions. This, in turn, can contribute to the overall diversification of economies and the reduction of socio-economic inequality. Lastly, considering the evolving global economy and increased international cooperation, having a strong legal framework for private investments can contribute to Africa's integration into the global market. By participating in international trade agreements and adhering to established best practices, Africa can attract further investment and enter into new partnerships which can lead to a more diverse, robust, and interconnected economy. In summary, the legal and judicial security of private investments is crucial to Africa's economic and social progress. By establishing and maintaining sound legal frameworks, African governments can create an environment that is conducive to investment, helps combat corruption, ensures transparency, and promotes the sustainable development of the continent."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you will be presented with a question in Persian.

Movie title: Death Ship Movie plot: A mysterious black freighter sails through the night, apparently deserted. Detecting a cruise ship close by, the ship alters course as disembodied voices announce in German, \\"Battle Stations! Enemy in sight!\\" Aboard the cruise ship, the prickly Captain Ashland is making his final voyage, attended by his replacement, Captain Trevor Marshall, who has brought along his family. The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a mysterious voice speaking to him in German, telling him \\"This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!\\" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and they separate to retrieve supplies and the injured captain.... The answer is:","response":"The memorabilia on the vessel in the movie \\"Death Ship\\" is from the 1930s era. The survivors exploring the mysterious black freighter find cobwebs and various items from the 1930s as they wander through its corridors, signifying that the ship might have a connection to or be influenced by that time period.

Sir Georg Solti, (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels.

It's short and un-intimidating. The vocabulary develops naturally, incrementally with the story lines, in a way that builds confidence. 'Children's book' is an apt description of the characters and situations, but it doesn't cloy for an adult learning the language. The illustrations are a pleasure and useful because they support the text. Unfortunately this is a very pricey introduction to French at just less than sixty pages. It's as if the publishers tossed it into a very crowded market without much forethought. Better to have planned a series of these booklets to develop a following or as an incentive to adopt a packet of them in an educational setting. Answer: Answer:","response":"The product review has both positive and negative tones. The positive tone is apparent throughout the majority of the review, with the author praising various aspects of the beginner's French language reader. They describe it as \\"enjoyable,\\" \\"short and un-intimidating,\\" and appreciate the natural, incremental development of vocabulary in line with the storylines. They also acknowledge that even though it is a children's book, it still works well for adults learning the language, and they commend the illustrations for being both aesthetically pleasing and helpful in supporting the text. However, alongside the positive tone comes a noticeable negative undertone when discussing the price of the product. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the price, calling the book \\"very pricey\\" for its length (less than sixty pages). They also criticize the publishers' decision to release the book into a crowded market without much apparent forethought and suggest that it would have been better to create a series or package of booklets to encourage customers to make a purchase or adopt the product in an educational setting. Overall, while the review is predominantly positive - praising the content, design, and functionalities of the reader - it includes a significant negative undertone when discussing its price and market positioning. This mixed tone indicates that the reviewer admires the product's quality but is disappointed in the way it has been brought to market and how that ultimately affects its value for the potential consumers."},{"question":"Question: What nation's cameras does the CIPA DC-004 apply to?

Glenn Lee Beck (born February 10, 1964) is an American talk show host, political commentator, and producer. He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze. In 1983 he moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, to work at radio station KZFM. In mid-1985, Beck was hired away from KZFM to be the lead DJ for the morning-drive radio broadcast by WRKA in Louisville, Kentucky. His four-hour weekday show was called Captain Beck and the A-Team. Beck had a reputation as a \\"young up-and-comer\\". The show was not political and included the usual off-color antics of the genre: juvenile jokes, pranks, and impersonations. The show slipped to third in the market and Beck left abruptly in 1987 amid a dispute with WRKA management. Months later, Beck was hired by Phoenix Top-40 station KOY-FM, then known as Y-95. Beck was partnered with Arizona native Tim Hattrick to co-host a local \\"morning zoo\\" program. During his time at Y-95, Beck cultivated a rivalry with local pop radio station KZZP and that station's morning host Bruce Kelly. Through practical jokes and publicity stunts, Beck drew criticism from the staff at Y-95 when the rivalry culminated in Beck telephoning Kelly's wife on-the-air, mocking her recent miscarriage. In 1989, Beck resigned from Y-95 to accept a job in Houston at KRBE, known as Power 104. Beck was subsequently fired in 1990 due to poor ratings. Beck then moved on to Baltimore, Maryland, and the city's leading Top-40 station, WBSB, known as B104. There, he partnered with Pat Gray, a morning DJ. During his tenure at B104, Beck was arrested and jailed for speeding in his DeLorean. According to a former associate, Beck was \\"completely out of it\\" when a station manager went to bail him out. When Gray, then Beck were fired, the two men spent six months in Baltimore, planning their next move. In early 1992, Beck and Gray both moved to WKCI-FM (KC101), a Top-40 radio station in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1995, WKCI apologized after Beck and Gray mocked a Chinese-American caller on air who felt offended by a comedy segment by playing a gong sound effect and having executive producer Alf Gagineau mock a Chinese accent. That incident led to protests by activist groups. When Gray left the show to move to Salt Lake City, Beck continued with co-host Vinnie Penn. At the end of 1998, Beck was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of 1999. The Glenn Beck Program first aired in 2000 on WFLA (AM) in Tampa, and took their afternoon time slot from eighteenth to first place within a year. In January 2002, Premiere Radio Networks launched the show nationwide on 47 stations. The show then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, broadcasting from new flagship station WPHT. On November 5, 2007, The New York Times reported that Premiere Radio Networks was extending Beck's contract. By May 2008, it had reached over 280 terrestrial stations as well as XM Satellite. It was ranked 4th in the nation with over six and a half million listeners. As of July 2013, Beck was tied for number four in the ratings behind Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Dave Ramsey.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose blood sugar increases happens, how will it affect more glucose is produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"If blood sugar levels increase in the body, it would indeed have an effect on the process and trigger a different response. To better understand this, let's first revise the process described and then discuss the perturbation hypothesis and its consequences. Process for restoring blood sugar levels when they drop: 1. Blood sugar levels decrease in the body. 2. The pancreas responds by releasing glucagon in the bloodstream. 3. The liver absorbs the glucagon and converts stored glycogen into glucose. 4. The liver releases the new glucose back into the bloodstream. 5. Blood sugar levels are restored to normal. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis, which suggests that blood sugar levels increase in the body. The effects of increased blood sugar levels are as follows: 1. Blood sugar levels increase in the body. 2. The increase is sensed by specialized cells in the pancreas (primarily beta cells). 3. In response, the pancreas starts releasing insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin acts as a key to help glucose enter cells. 4. As cells in the muscles, fat, and liver take in glucose with the help of insulin, they store it in the form of glycogen or convert it into energy. 5. The increased glucose uptake by the cells reduces the glucose concentration in the bloodstream, and blood sugar levels decrease. The perturbation hypothesis affects the process indirectly. When blood sugar levels increase, it does not directly lead to more glucose production. Instead, it affects the secretion of insulin by the pancreas, which helps regulate the uptake of glucose by cells in the body. Consequently, insulin has a direct effect on subsequent glucose production, as it helps cells take in glucose and stimulates the liver to store the excess glucose as glycogen. In summary, when blood sugar levels increase, it triggers a different response in the body that involves insulin. This response affects glucose production and uptake, ensuring that blood glucose concentrations are properly regulated and maintained within a healthy range."},{"question":"By. Anthony Bond.

Question: suppose a heatwave taking place happens, how will it affect More oxygen is taken in through the nose or mouth. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"During a heatwave, the body's demand for oxygen may increase in order to help regulate the body's temperature and maintain optimal functioning. As a result, it can be said that more oxygen is taken in through the nose or mouth. In the given process, the oxygen taken in through the nose or mouth travels into the body and breaks down glucose, producing carbon dioxide as a waste product. The carbon dioxide is then exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. If the heatwave influences the body's demand for more oxygen, it will potentially affect the second effect mentioned, which is breaking down glucose. In a heatwave, the body works harder to maintain its core temperature, leading to an increase in metabolic rate. As a result, the body's demand for glucose as a source of energy may also increase. With more oxygen being inhaled to meet the heightened energy demand, there will be an increase in glucose breakdown. This, in turn, will lead to a higher production of carbon dioxide as a byproduct. The supposed perturbation of a heatwave leads to more oxygen being taken in through the nose or mouth, which consequently influences the second effect mentioned in the process by increasing the breakdown of glucose within the body. Therefore, the heatwave exerts a \\"more\\" effect on the second effect mentioned in the process.

If a guy a always goes out his way for me at work what does that mean? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"The two questions you've asked share similarities in the sense that they both revolve around the same theme: a person, in this context a guy, who is making an effort to care for or help another individual. However, there are slight differences that set them apart. 1. What does it mean when someone goes out of his way to make sure I'm alright? When someone goes out of their way to make sure you're alright, it generally indicates that they care about your well-being and feel a sense of responsibility towards you. This behaviour demonstrates concern, empathy, and potentially even affection. It's a sign that they're invested in your welfare and are willing to put in extra effort to ensure your comfort or happiness. Possible reasons for such behavior could be: - Friendship: The person sees you as a good friend and wants to be there for you. They might see it as their role in the friendship to make sure you're doing well. - Crush or romantic interest: The person may have romantic feelings for you and, as a result, feels the need to protect and care for you, even in seemingly commonplace situations. - Empathetic or nurturing nature: Some people have a deeply caring disposition by nature, and they go out of their way to ensure the well-being of others. It may be a natural instinct for them to look out for those around them. - Work or social dynamics: In some working environments or social circles, a person may feel it's their responsibility to make sure everyone is doing well. This could either be due to a hierarchical role, or simply because they see themselves as the \\"caretaker\\" of the group. 2. If a guy always goes out of his way for me at work, what does that mean? In this context, the question is more specific, referring to a guy at work who consistently goes out of his way to help you. While the possible underlying reasons remain similar to those discussed in the previous question, there are some additional considerations that pertain specifically to the workplace. - Professional responsibility: The guy might feel that it's his duty in his job to make sure everyone on the team is doing well. This could be associated with his role, or an unspoken responsibility he has taken upon himself. - Cultivating a positive work environment: The guy could believe that creating a supportive and positive work environment is essential for productivity and success. He might be going the extra mile to make sure everyone is comfortable and content at work, including you. - Networking and rapport: Some people understand the importance of building strong relationships in the workplace for future career growth or professional development. Engaging in supportive behavior is a way to foster such relationships and forge stronger connections with coworkers. To conclude, while both questions involve a person caring and showing concern for another individual, the first question is broader and more general, while the second refers specifically to a work environment. The underlying reasons for the person's behaviour in both questions can be generally aligned, but there are some unique considerations that apply specifically to the workplace context."},{"question":"Translate to French: He had been taken back to his mother in Tsévié by Terre des Hommes, but had returned to the centre one week later.","response":"Il avait été ramené à sa mère à Tsévié par Terre des Hommes, mais était revenu au centre une semaine plus tard.

(Photo: Eric Seals/ Free Press photographer)Buy Photo UPDATE: Tesla says no evidence Autopilot involved in Pa. crash A Southfield art gallery owner told police his 2016 Tesla Model X was in Autopilot mode when it crashed and rolled over on the Pennsylvania Turnpike last week. The crash came just one day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a report on a fatal crash in May involving a Tesla that was in self-driving mode. Albert Scaglione and his artist son-in-law, Tim Yanke, both survived Friday's crash near the Bedford exit, about 107 miles east of Pittsburgh. The Free Press was not able to reach Scaglione, owner of Park West Gallery, or Yanke, but Dale Vukovich of the Pennsylvania State Police, who responded to the crash, said Scaglione told him that he had activated the Autopilot feature. In his crash report, Vukovich stated that Scaglione's car was traveling east near mile marker 160, about 5 p.m. when it hit a guard rail \\"off the right side of the roadway. It then crossed over the eastbound lanes and hit the concrete median.\\" After that, the Tesla Model X rolled onto its roof and came to rest in the middle eastbound lane.

Vukovich said he likely will cite Scaglione after he completes his investigation, but he declined to specify the charge. Anyone who has driven on the Pennsylvania Turnpike knows that its narrow shoulders and concrete medians leave little margin for driver error. There's not enough evidence to indicate that Tesla's Autopilot malfunctioned. Last Wednesday, NHTSA announced it is investigating the design and performance of the Autopilot system after a 40-year-old Canton, Ohio, man died May 7 in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S hit a tractor-trailer while in self-driving mode, The federal agency said both the driver and the Autopilot system failed to detect the large tractor-trailer making a left turn in front of him. But the driver of the truck said there was a Harry Potter video still running when the Tesla came to a stop about a quarter-mile from the impact. Tesla says that before Autopilot can be used, drivers have to acknowledge that the system is an \\"assist feature\\" that requires a driver to keep both hands on the wheel at all times. Drivers are told they need to \\"maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle\\" while using the system, and they have to be prepared to take over at any time. Later this month, NHTSA, which is authorized to set the safety rules for increasingly autonomous vehicles, will issue guidelines intended to set the near-term rules of the road in autonomous vehicle research.Autonomous vehicle advocates argue that over time they can make a quantum improvement in safety. But regulators must operate in the present. Last month at a conference in Novi, NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind argued that technology like Autopilot should be twice as safe as the manual systems they replace. The other risk illustrated in the Florida crash is the tension between what automakers call automated driver assist features, such as emergency braking, lane departure alert and adaptive cruise control, and a more daring level of autonomy that is touted as allowing occupants to text, e-mail, watch movies and otherwise disengage from driving.

In the nonfatal crash, a Tesla SUV rolled over Friday on the Pennsylvania Turnpike after hitting barriers on both sides of the highway. Safety officials continue to investigate a fatal Florida accident in May. The driver of the Pennsylvania vehicle told the Pennsylvania State Police that he was operating it in Autopilot mode. Tesla vehicles sit parked outside a new showroom and service centre in Red Hook, Brooklyn, on July 5, 2016. The electric car company has come under increasing scrutiny following two crashes that occurred while drivers were using Tesla's controversial autopilot service. ( Spencer Platt / GETTY IMAGES ) The accidents have put new scrutiny on Tesla’s Autopilot system and raised questions about whether the technology, which the company describes as only an experimental “beta” test, lulls drivers into a false sense of security. Although Tesla drivers have posted YouTube videos of themselves operating the vehicles completely hands-free — even climbing into the back seat — the company has cautioned that Autopilot is meant only as an “auto-assist” feature that requires drivers to keep their hands on or near the steering wheel at all times. In the Florida crash, the first known fatality involving an autonomous driving system, the driver was killed when his Tesla Model S sedan struck a tractor-trailer that was crossing the roadway. Article Continued Below An account given Wednesday by a witness to the Florida accident seemed to indicate that the Autopilot system continued operating the car at highway speed, even after the vehicle’s top was sheared off by the impact and the Tesla went under the trailer and continued down the road. “The car came from underneath the trailer,” said the witness, Terence Mulligan, who was named in the Florida Highway Patrol’s accident report. Mulligan, who was driving behind the tractor-trailer at the time, said: “The top was gone. It went right by me.” Mulligan, in a telephone interview, said he turned and followed the Tesla, which did not slow down until it had left the road, crashed through two fences and hit a utility pole. His account jibed with the accident report by the Florida Highway Patrol, which said the car was travelling at 65 mph (105 km/h) when it hit the tractor-trailer. Tesla has declined to comment on the details of the Florida crash, which is still under investigation by state and federal officials. In a statement Wednesday about the Pennsylvania crash, Tesla said it had “no reason to believe that Autopilot had anything to do with this accident” based on the information it had collected so far. The Pennsylvania crash involved a Model X SUV heading east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike about 160 km east of Pittsburgh. The car scraped a guardrail on the right side of the road, crossed the roadway and hit the concrete median. It then rolled over onto its roof and came to a stop in the middle of the road. Tesla vehicles have the ability to send data to the company about their condition and operation. In a statement, the company said it received an automated alert from the Model X in Pennsylvania on July 1 showing that its airbags had deployed. But the company said more detailed information about the car’s operation was not received, a situation that could happen if the car’s antenna was damaged in the crash. Article Continued Below Details of the Pennsylvania crash were first reported by the Detroit Free Press. The Pennsylvania State Police declined to release additional details because an investigation is in progress. The Pennsylvania driver, Albert Scaglione, said by phone Wednesday that he had just been released from the hospital and declined to comment on the accident. “My attorneys will be releasing a statement shortly,” he said. A passenger in the car, Tim Yanke, was reportedly not seriously injured. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday that it was collecting information from the Pennsylvania State Police, Tesla and the driver to find out whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash. The federal safety agency has also sent a crash investigation team to Florida to determine if the Tesla Autopilot system was at fault in the accident on May 7, which killed Joshua Brown, 40, from Canton, Ohio. In the Florida crash, charges are pending against Frank Baressi, the driver of the tractor-trailer that was hit by Brown’s Tesla. But no final determination on charges will be made until the inquiry is complete, Sgt. Kim Montes, a spokeswoman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said Wednesday. “We know the truck made a left turn, and the person going straight has the right of way,” she said, referring to Brown’s vehicle. Baressi, reached by phone, declined to comment. In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Baressi said he had heard a Harry Potter movie playing from Brown’s vehicle but also acknowledged, “He went so fast through my trailer, I didn’t see him.” Montes said, “We don’t know if that’s accurate,” adding, “We may never know, obviously, given the damage of the vehicle. In a very violent crash, there’s not going to be a lot left inside a car that could be playing.” A DVD player and a laptop computer were recovered from Brown’s vehicle after the crash. Questions have been raised about why neither Tesla nor the federal safety agency notified the public sooner about the May 7 accident, if only to caution other drivers about using Tesla’s Autopilot feature. After the federal investigation of Brown’s accident was disclosed last week, Tesla released a statement Tuesday saying it had informed the agency of the crash “immediately after it occurred.” But Tesla said it did not tell the federal agency about the accident until nine days later. The Florida Highway Patrol contacted Tesla, seeking help in downloading data from the car’s so-called black-box recorder, seven to 10 days after the crash. The company said in a statement that it was obligated to notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on a quarterly basis when it became aware of a fatal accident involving a Tesla vehicle. “As part of its regular ongoing communication and not as part of any formal process, Tesla told NHTSA about the accident while it was still in the process of conducting its investigation,” Tesla said. “This happened on May 16.” ||||| SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (WXYZ) - A crash of a Tesla Model X on the Pennsylvania turnpike has generated confusion and triggered an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The accident, which happened on July 1, involved two Michigan residents. The driver of the vehicle was Southfield art gallery owner Albert Scaglione. His son-in-law, Tim Yanke, was in the car with him at the time of the accident, which took place at about 5 p.m.near the Bedford exit of the turnpike. Scaglione was said to be driving his 2016 Tesla Model X, a vehicle introduced with great fanfare in September of last year by Tesla founder Elon Musk. Scaglione reportedly told police he had the driver assistance \\"Autopilot\\" feature activated when the car crashed and rolled over. However, there is no indication of that in the accident report filed by Dale Vukovich with the Pennsylvania State Police. Tesla is also disputing that In a statement to 7 Action News, suggesting it has no data to suggest that Autopilot was activated at the time of the crash. \\"We received an automated alert from this vehicle on July 1 indicating airbag deployment, but logs containing detailed information on the state of the vehicle controls at the time of the collision were never received,\\" Tesla said in an email. Attempts by the Palo Alto-based company to reach Scaglione have been unsuccessful. \\"As we do with all crash events, we immediately reached out to the customer to confirm they were ok and offer support but were unable to reach him,\\" the statement continued. \\"We have since attempted to contact the customer three times by phone without success. Based on the information we have now, we have no reason to believe that Autopilot had anything to do with this accident.\\" The federal agency in charge of auto safety said it is also looking into the crash, according to a brief statement emailed to 7 Action News. \\"“NHTSA is collecting information from the Pennsylvania State Police, Tesla and the driver of a Tesla Model X involved in a crash on July 1 to determine whether automated functions were in use at the time of the crash,\\" the statement said. Efforts to reach both Scaglione and his son-in-law have been unsuccessful. There was no comment when 7 Action News visited Park West Gallery Wednesday to ask for Scaglione. The 77-year-old was transported to a local hospital following the accident, according to the police report. The severity of his injuries was listed as unknown. The day before the crash by Scaglione, NHTSA began an investigation into the design and performance of Tesla's Autopilot system after a fatal crash in Florida in 2015. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"A Southfield art gallery owner told police his 2016 Tesla Model X was in Autopilot mode when it crashed and rolled over on the Pennsylvania Turnpike last week.

David Cameron has had the narrowest of political escapes. Success for the \\"Better Together\\" campaign has saved him from catastrophe: he will not, after all, live on in history as the Prime Minister on whose watch the Scottish nation chose to leave the United Kingdom. But serious questions will now be asked in his party and in the country about his future. Cameron will also face an almighty battle in Parliament to deliver the consolation prize of greatly enhanced powers for the Scottish Parliament, the so-called \\"Devo Max\\" package, which he was forced to concede in the panicky latter stages of the No campaign. There was a majority for the Parliament but the 40% margin was not achieved and the","response":"vote was much closer than anticipated. With 52% voting in favor of remaining in the United Kingdom and 48% voting for Scottish independence, the \\"Better Together\\" campaign could hardly call this a resounding victory. In fact, many have questioned whether Cameron's last-minute promises to the Scottish people were the only reason this slim majority was achieved. Both the Labour and Conservative parties will be scrutinizing Cameron's handling of the situation, and discussions about his ability to lead their party, and the country, will certainly gain momentum. With the upcoming general election not far away, this could negatively affect the Conservatives' chances of securing a majority government. As for the \\"Devo Max\\" package, the road ahead will prove to be an uphill struggle. The very nature of this last-ditch effort by Cameron means that there was next to no consultation with other major political parties, and the proposal was seen as a desperate attempt to quell Scottish discontent. Conservative MPs are rumored to be disgruntled about this sudden policy shift and the pandering to demands of one part of the United Kingdom at the expense of the others. Conversely, Labour MPs are concerned that increased autonomy for the Scottish Parliament would diminish their influence over the UK as a whole, as the party has traditionally maintained a strong support base in Scotland. This discord within Parliament will lead to arduous negotiations and a very real possibility of clashes between the major parties. It will be crucial for Cameron to swiftly establish clear and coherent policies for the implementation of the \\"Devo Max\\" package. Failure to do so will leave him vulnerable not only to dissatisfied MPs within his own party but also to the wider public, who may perceive this as yet another example of weak leadership. There are already talks of a potential leadership challenge in the coming months which could put Cameron's position at risk. Prominent figures within the Conservative party, such as Boris Johnson and Theresa May, are rumored to be eyeing a bid for the top job. It seems as though Cameron's relief at Scotland's decision to remain in the UK might be short-lived, as he faces renewed questions about his leadership capabilities and an uncertain political future. Going forward, it is essential for David Cameron not only to deliver on his promises to the Scottish people but also to take steps to address the underlying issues that led to such a close referendum result. This includes a broader political reform, rebalancing of power structures, and ensuring that the UK operates as a cohesive and united entity. It remains to be seen whether Cameron will rise to the challenge or ultimately be remembered as a Prime Minister who lost credibility amidst a battle for political survival."},{"question":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Asif Aryain\\" Answer:","response":"I cannot rate this review as it does not provide any information or context regarding the subject being reviewed.

Take a block of cheese and rub it against a cheesegrater","response":"To make shredded cheese, one should follow these steps: Step 1: Choose the right tool The correct tool for shredding cheese is a cheese grater. A can opener is not designed for this purpose and would not be suitable. Therefore, in this situation, the best option is option (2). Step 2: Select the cheese Select a block of cheese that you want to shred. Consider the type of cheese, its firmness, and its purpose (for example, which dish the shredded cheese will be used in). Step 3: Prepare the cheese If the cheese is cold or hard, let it sit at room temperature for a short while to soften slightly. This will make it easier to grate. Ensure that the cheese block is clean and dry. Step 4: Hold the cheese grater Hold the cheese grater securely in one hand. Make sure to place it on a stable surface, such as a cutting board or countertop. Step 5: Grate the cheese With your other hand, grasping the block of cheese, gently press the cheese against the grater's holes, and make firm, downward motions across the grater's surface. Be sure to apply even pressure while grating. Step 6: Collect the shredded cheese As you grate the cheese, the shreds will collect either on the cutting board or in a container, if your grater has one. Periodically check the collection area and move the shredded cheese to a separate container as it accumulates. Step 7: Clean up Once you have shredded the desired amount of cheese, carefully clean the grater, making sure to remove any cheese remnants from the grater's holes. Store the shredded cheese in an airtight container in the refrigerator until it's ready to be used. By following these steps and choosing the correct tool (option 2), someone would be able to successfully shred cheese according to their goal."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Terrible What's with the unecassery folders?

Analysts weigh in on the game's place in football history: Last night brought us \\"the most Eli Manning moment of Eli Manning’s career.\\" During the game-winning touchdown, we saw \\"a hero shot in which the conqueror looks totally confused by his conquest,\\" with \\"arms half-raised in quasi-triumph.\\" His quiet humility was the polar opposite of Tom Brady's \\"aggro posture,\\" but it remains \\"difficult to understand,\\" writes Josh Levin at Slate. Still, there's no doubt he's a become a football hero, notes Bill Barnwell at Grantland. In 2007, \\"he did not lead his team to a title; he was dragged, kicking and screaming, by a dominant defense. Four years later, Eli Manning stood at the helm and dragged a flagging defense to a second World Championship.\\" It was a close game, but that's nothing new. In fact, the \\"last nine Super Bowls have all now featured seven-point games in the fourth quarter,\\" notes Don Banks at Sports Illustrated. Still, \\"the Giants' comeback from that eight-point deficit was just shy of tying the largest in Super Bowl history,\\" at 10 points. In the end, the Giants \\"stole\\" the game from the New England Patriots, writes Bill Plaschke in the Los Angeles Times. As for Tom Brady's team, \\"Mistakes filled their hands, recklessness rocked their focus, and mortality rumbled in the distance.\\" \\"It was indeed a night when the Giants were 'Wow' while the Patriots were 'What?'\\"","response":"The great game that erupted on the field last night was an electrifying spectacle of tenacity, exhilarating energy, and, somewhat bafflingly, an exhibition of Eli Manning's unexpected form of gallantry. The game commanded a pivotal place in football history, punctuated by what has been fittingly dubbed \\"the most Eli Manning moment of Eli Manning’s career.\\" The essence of this statement could be derived from the game-winning touchdown, where Manning personified the enigmatic conqueror who is unshaken yet relatively bewildered by his conquest. The winning snapshot was captured as Manning displayed \\"arms half-raised in quasi-triumph,\\" a visage that perfectly encapsulates the soft-spoken triumph of him. This visual distinctly contrasted with Tom Brady's ostensibly aggressive demeanor, reinforcing Manning's humble disposition. However, comprehending this unusual but successful approach in high-stakes action remains obscure. As Josh Levin at Slate astutely notes, this 'quiet victory pose' is both hard to encapsulate and to comprehend. Despite the perplexing elements of his demeanor, there's an undeniable consensus about Manning's identity now being solidified as a football hero. Bill Barnwell at Grantland illuminates light on Manning's transformative journey over the years. In 2007, he did not guide his team to a title independently. Instead, his team's dominant defense carried Manning unwillingly and insistently towards victory. However, the fire-forged veteran that we saw four years later led the charge, compelling a faltering defense towards their second World Championship. It was Manning's sheer force of will and leadership that stood tall in the face of adversity. The nail-biting game, intense enough to keep fans on the edge of their seats, is fast becoming a familiar narrative at this stage of football's grandiose tournament. As Don Banks at Sports Illustrated remarks, \\"the last nine Super Bowls have all now featured seven-point games in the fourth quarter.\\" On this occasion, we witnessed the Giants bounce back from an eight-point deficit, only just falling short of matching the largest comeback in Super Bowl history, which stands at 10 points. Even if fractions away from this record, this comeback highlighted the strength and resilience of Manning and his Giants. As the dust settled, it was apparent that the game had been prised out of the grasp of the New England Patriots. As per Bill Plaschke in the Los Angeles Times, \\"the Giants stole the game,\\" as Brady's team was left grappling with their shortcomings. Mistakes cluttered their game, their reckless actions skewed their focus, and a menacing sense of their mortality resonated in their performance's backdrop. Summarizing this nail-biting encounter, the difference between the teams was stark. The Giants were bedazzling, earning exclamations of 'Wow,' while the Patriots stumbled their way, causing spectators to question, 'What?' It was indeed a night of stark contrasts, a night where Eli Manning's understated yet effective heroism gained him a lionized spot in football history. In the end, it was the gallantry of the humble hero that carried the day, silencing critics, and astonishing admirers."},{"question":"Information: - U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin formed in 1976.

Formally, a data differencing algorithm takes as input source data and target data, and produces difference data such that given the source data and the difference data, one can reconstruct the target data (\\"patching\\" the source with the difference to produce the target). - Delta encoding is a way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences ( deltas ) between sequential data rather than complete files ; more generally this is known as data differencing . Delta encoding is sometimes called delta compression , particularly where archival histories of changes are required ( e.g. , in revision control software ) . The differences are recorded in discrete files called \`\` deltas '' or \`\` diffs '' . In situations where differences are small -- for example , the change of a few words in a large document or the change of a few records in a large table -- delta encoding greatly reduces data redundancy . Collections of unique deltas are substantially more space - efficient than their non-encoded equivalents . From a logical point of view the difference between two data values is the information required to obtain one value from the other -- see relative entropy . The difference between identical values ( under some equivalence ) is often called 0 or the neutral element . Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'use' with the subject 'delta encoding'.

He was born in Haswell, County Durham and later moved to Harworth, Nottinghamshire. Simpson began road cycling as a teenager before taking up track cycling, specialising in pursuit races. He won a bronze medal for track cycling at the 1956 Summer Olympics and a silver at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Simpson was born on 30 November 1937 in Haswell, County Durham, the youngest of six children of coal miner Tom Simpson and his wife Alice (nee Cheetham). His father had been a semi-professional sprinter in athletics. The family lived modestly in a small terraced house until 1943, when his parents took charge of the village's working men's club and lived above it. In 1950 the Simpsons moved to Harworth on the Nottinghamshire-Yorkshire border, where young Simpson's maternal aunt lived; new coalfields were opening, with employment opportunities for him and older brother Harry, by now, the only children left at home. Simpson rode his first bike, his brother-in-law's, at age 12, sharing it with Harry and two cousins for time trials around Harworth. Following Harry, Tom joined Harworth & District CC (Cycling Club) aged 13. He delivered groceries in the Bassetlaw district by bicycle and traded with a customer for a better road bike. He was often left behind in club races; members of his cycling club nicknamed him \\"four-stone Coppi\\", after Italian rider Fausto Coppi, due to his slim physique. Simpson began winning club time trials, but sensed resentment of his boasting from senior members. He left Harworth & District and joined Rotherham's Scala Wheelers at the end of 1954. Simpson's first road race was as a junior at the Forest Recreation Ground in Nottingham. After leaving school he was an apprentice draughtsman at an engineering company in Retford, using the 10 mi (16.1 km) commute by bike as training. He placed well in half mile races on grass and cement, but decided to concentrate on road racing. In May 1955 Simpson won the National Cyclists' Union South Yorkshire individual pursuit track event as a junior; the same year, he won the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) junior hill climb championship and placed third in the senior event. Simpson immersed himself in the world of cycling, writing letters asking for advice. Naturalised Austrian rider George Berger responded, travelling from London to Harworth to help him with his riding position. In late 1955, Simpson ran a red light in a race and was suspended from racing for six months by the BLRC. During his suspension he dabbled in motorcycle trials, nearly quitting cycling but unable to afford a new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What does his mother do?","response":"From the provided information, it is not explicitly mentioned what Thomas Simpson's mother, Alice, did for a living or her specific role in the family.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Would France have lower or higher labor supply? Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. A:","response":"Given the context provided, France would likely have a lower labor supply in comparison to Germany due to their pro-socialist government's implementation of tax rates above the critical rate. This outcome can be more comprehensively examined with the aid of the Laffer curve. The Laffer curve is a representation that demonstrates the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. It asserts that there exists an optimal tax rate, or critical rate, where the government maximizes its revenue. If the tax rate is below the optimal rate, it means that the government could potentially increase its revenue by raising taxes. On the other hand, if the tax rate is above the critical rate, it implies that the high tax rates are driving down labor supply. In this case, lowering tax rates would increase labor supply, thus also increasing government revenue. In this scenario, post-second world war West Germany chose to elect pro-capitalist governments that implemented tax rate below the critical rate. This approach likely encouraged a higher labor supply as businesses and individuals could keep more of their income, which in turn can stimulate investment, entrepreneurship, and overall economic activity. On the other hand, France chose pro-socialist governments which led to tax rates above the critical rate. When tax rates are above the critical rate, it effectively discourages the labor supply. High taxes result in less disposable income and can create disincentives for individuals and businesses to work, invest, or undertake entrepreneurial ventures. This higher tax burden reduces the attractiveness of engaging in economic activities, leading to a decline in the labor supply. Consequently, France's labor supply would be lower as a result of these policies. In essence, the Laffer curve suggests that by decreasing the tax rate in France, it could potentially increase the labor supply, which would then lead to a larger government revenue over time. To summarize, the differing taxation policies implemented by West Germany and France after World War II resulted in varying labor supply outcomes. West Germany's pro-capitalist approach led to tax rates below the critical rate and a higher labor supply. In contrast, France's pro-socialist policies led to tax rates above the critical rate, resulting in a lower labor supply. The Laffer curve emphasizes that, when the tax rate is above the critical point, a reduction in the tax rate could potentially increase labor supply and subsequently government revenue."},{"question":"Tweet: My productivity has been SHOT this week. Here's to trying again tomorrow Predict the sentiment of this tweet. Choose your answer from: * negative; * positive;","response":"To predict the sentiment of the tweet, let's analyze the content step-by-step: 1. Identify keywords: The keywords in this tweet are \\"productivity,\\" \\"SHOT,\\" \\"week,\\" and \\"trying again tomorrow.\\" 2. Assess the feelings associated with the keywords: \\"Productivity\\" is a neutral term, but being productive usually has a positive connotation. \\"SHOT\\" is capitalized and implies a strong emotion—possibly a negative one—regarding the user's productivity. \\"Week\\" is also neutral, while \\"trying again tomorrow\\" indicates an intention to improve or do better in the future. 3. Evaluate the overall sentiment based on the keywords: The tweet acknowledges a decrease in productivity—a negative aspect—but it also suggests a desire to improve and try again, hinting at a more positive sentiment. Considering the analysis, the sentiment of the tweet seems to be a mix of both negative and positive elements. However, the focus on trying again tomorrow leans toward a positive outlook.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: (i) no. (ii) yes.","response":"(i) no. The first question is about how South Korea developed its great economy. So, South Korea developed into a strong economy through hard work, smart planning, and support from other countries.

Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

The person being referred to is Caspar David Friedrich, a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

You’ll likely have to take a vacation day, but some work places that allow free leave will understand and encourage a celebration of your birth! Account for the work time lost from your birthday by working ahead prior to the big day. You don’t want to follow up your birthday with a day full of errands and catch up work. Don’t schedule any meetings or errands on your birthday unless they are absolutely necessary. You want to worry about nothing at all for your birthday. Going to bed early ensures you wake up bright and early to take advantage of your clean slate. The average number of hours to aim for when getting sleep is between 7 and 9 hours for the average adult, but adding an hour in either direction may also be appropriate depending on your needs. Don’t drink too much before going to bed. If you drink too much in the evening, you’ll find your sleep interrupted by the need to go to the bathroom all night. Consider tossing the alarm clock for the evening. Just let your body handle everything, and get up only when you feel refreshed. Don’t be afraid to sleep in. It's your day after all. A few extra hours of sleep feel great and might be what you need to get in the right mindset for the day. Go out to a fancy restaurant and get your favorite meal, or order in and let the food come to your front door. Your birthday is a good day to order that new meal or dish you’ve always wanted to try. Many restaurants offer free meals or sides when it's your birthday. Take a look online and see if you can score a few free bites! This applies to retail stores as well. Have some breakfast in bed. If you live with someone, ask if they’ll bring breakfast right to your bed. Bring a food tray and napkins so that you don’t get crumbs or runny egg on your bed.

Cards make a great decoration for window sills or on the kitchen table. If you received gift cards or money for your birthday, think about what you are going to do with those gifts. The day is open, but make sure you don’t let the money burn a hole in your pocket. Buy yourself a cake, or make one yourself. If you make one yourself, consider making it the night before.

Sentence 1: - At risk individuals include those who have suffered strokes or are suffering from cardiovascular disease and angina. Sentence 2: - At-risk individuals will need a special medication regimen to recover. Step 2: Compare the relationships between the main points of the two sentences to establish possible entailment. In Sentence 1, we learn that at-risk individuals are those who have suffered strokes or are suffering from cardiovascular disease and angina. This sentence does not contain information about any specific medication or treatment required for these individuals. In Sentence 2, it is stated that at-risk individuals will need a special medication regimen to recover.

She was the founding producer of the science-fiction series Doctor Who and she had a long association with Thames Television. Her many credits include Adam Adamant Lives! Later in 1974 Lambert became Head of Drama at Thames Television. During her time in this position she oversaw several high-profile and successful contributions to the ITV network, including The Naked Civil Servant (1975), Rock Follies (1976-77), Rumpole of the Bailey (1978-92) and Edward and Mrs Simpson (1978). In 1976 she was also made responsible for overseeing the work of Euston Films, Thames' subsidiary film production company, at the time best known as the producers of The Sweeney. In 1979 she transferred to Euston full-time as the company's Chief Executive, overseeing productions such as Quatermass (1979), Minder (1979-94) and Widows (1983). At Thames and Euston, Lambert enjoyed the most sustained period of critical and popular success of her career. The Naked Civil Servant won a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for its star John Hurt as well as a Broadcasting Press Guild Award and a prize at the Prix Italia; Rock Follies won a BAFTA and a Royal Television Society Award, while Widows also gained BAFTA nominations and ratings of over 12 million--unusually for a drama serial, it picked up viewers over the course of its six-week run. Minder went on to become the longest-running series produced by Euston Films, surviving for over a decade following Lambert's departure from the company. Television historian Lez Cooke described Lambert's time in control of the drama department at Thames as \\"an adventurous period for the company, demonstrating that it was not only the BBC that was capable of producing progressive television drama during the 1970s. Lambert wanted Thames to produce drama series 'which were attempting in one way or another to tackle modern problems and life,' an ambition which echoed the philosophy of her mentor Sydney Newman.\\" Howard Schuman, the writer of Rock Follies, also later praised the bravery of Lambert's commissioning. \\"Verity Lambert had just arrived as head of drama at Thames TV and she went for broke,\\" he told The Observer newspaper in 2002. \\"She commissioned a serial, Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill, for safety, but also Bill Brand, one of the edgiest political dramas ever, and us ... Before we had even finished making the first series, Verity commissioned the second.\\" Lambert's association with Thames and Euston Films continued into the 1980s. In 1982, she rejoined the staff of parent company Thames Television as director of drama, and was given a seat on the company's board. In November 1982 she left Thames, but remained as chief executive at Euston until leaving in November of the following year to take up her first post in the film industry, as director of production for Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment. Her job here was somewhat frustrating as the British film industry was in one of its periodic states of flux, but she did produce several feature films, including Clockwise (1986). Lambert later expressed some regret on her time in the film industry in a feature for The Independent newspaper. \\"Unfortunately, the person who hired me left, and the person who came in didn't want to produce films and didn't want me. While I managed to make some films I was proud of--Dennis Potter's Dreamchild, and Clockwise with John Cleese--it was terribly tough and not a very happy experience.\\" Lambert was Chair of the British Film Institute Production Board from 1981-82.

Scientists at NASA #39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory declared themselves Which topic is this article about?","response":"This article is about the international Cassini spacecraft capturing and sending back photos of Saturn's moon, Titan, during a close flyby. The spacecraft flew within 745 miles of the moon, allowing it to obtain detailed images. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory were involved in analyzing the data and findings that Cassini transmitted during this flyby. Cassini was a joint effort between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) launched in 1997. The mission's primary objective was to study Saturn, its rings, and its moons, including its largest moon, Titan. The spacecraft provided valuable information regarding the composition and atmosphere of Titan, as well as insights into the geological processes of this fascinating moon. Throughout its mission, Cassini made several flybys of Titan, each yielding crucial data that helped scientists understand the complex nature of this moon. In addition to imaging, Cassini's suite of scientific instruments enabled it to analyze the chemical composition of Titan's atmosphere, which scientists believe to be similar to what Earth's atmosphere was like billions of years ago. The Cassini-Huygens mission discovered lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane, on Titan's surface, and some even theorize that it might harbor the conditions necessary for primitive life to exist. The Huygens probe, which was a part of the Cassini mission, successfully landed on Titan in 2005, becoming the first landing on a moon in the outer solar system. The probe transmitted images and data about Titan's surface and atmosphere for a few hours before it ceased operation. The flyby that the article mentions likely contributed new insights into Titan's atmospheric dynamics, weather patterns, and surface features, as well as provided high-resolution images that continue to deepen our understanding of this enigmatic moon. The cooperation between various space agencies working together on the Cassini mission highlights the power of international collaboration in advancing human knowledge of the universe. In September 2017, the Cassini mission concluded with the spacecraft deliberately being plunged into Saturn's atmosphere. This was done to ensure that it would not accidentally contaminate any of Saturn's potentially habitable moons. The Cassini mission has left a lasting legacy in the field of planetary science, and its wealth of data continues to improve our understanding of Saturn and its numerous moons."},{"question":"Translate to Romanian: This list of competences denotes the importance conferred on the GNSS Supervisory Authority and reinforces the demands placed on it to keep its activities and spending within the assigned budget, and to keep to the rules governing the budget's implementation.

The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons.

No, the first sentence and second sentence are not perfect paraphrases of each other because they convey different time frames and locations. In the first sentence, the subject moves to Los Angeles in December 1883 and then spends two years in Fresno. This suggests that the person first lives in Los Angeles for an unspecified amount of time, then moves to Fresno for a period of two years. In the second sentence, the subject moves to Fresno in December 1883 and then lives in Los Angeles for two years. This implies that the person first lives in Fresno for an unspecified amount of time, then moves to Los Angeles for a period of two years. 2). While they are similar in presenting the subject's moves to Los Angeles and Fresno in December 1883, the time spent in these locations is not accurately represented in both sentences. As mentioned earlier, the first sentence conveys the message that the subject moves to Los Angeles first, before moving to Fresno for two years.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"The sentence provided is: \\"The Attack on Pearl Harbor destroyed valuable jewels and pearls.\\" To determine if this sentence makes sense, let's break it down and analyze the key aspects: 1. The Attack on Pearl Harbor: This refers to the surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service on the United States' naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7, 1941. This event led to the United States' entry into World War II. 2. Destroyed valuable jewels and pearls: This phrase implies that the attack caused the destruction of precious stones and pearls. Now, let's consider if the sentence makes logical sense. Historically, the Attack on Pearl Harbor focused on damaging and destroying military assets, particularly the United States' Pacific Fleet. The main targets were battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and aircraft stationed at the base. While it is possible that some valuable jewels and pearls might have been destroyed incidentally during the attack, the primary focus and intent of the attack were not on these items. Thus, the sentence doesn't accurately reflect the primary outcomes or intentions of the attack. As a result, the appropriate answer to your question would be: - no"},{"question":"who was the last team to beat germany??","response":"The last team to beat Germany may change depending on when the question is asked and the latest football matches played.

A variety of factors can impact aging adults' quality of life. Two big ones, according to new research from the University of Arizona, are the health and cognitive functioning of a person's spouse. Analyzing data from more than 8,000 married couples -- with an average age in the early 60s -- researchers found that the physical health and cognitive functioning of a person's spouse can significantly affect a person's own quality of life. The findings have implications for how to most effectively address quality-of-life issues in people's later years. \\"When we think about quality of life for older adults, and improving quality of life, it seems like targeting the individual is only part of the story, and our findings suggests that for older adults, a larger part of individual well-being is defined by our partner's health and cognitive functioning as well,\\" said UA psychologist David Sbarra, a co-author of the paper, which will be published in Psychology and Aging, a journal of the American Psychological Association. The population of Americans age 65 years or older is expected to double during the next 25 years to about 72 million, as baby boomers age and people live longer. By 2030, older adults will account for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. population and health-care spending will increase by 25 percent, largely because of the aging population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\"As we build public health interventions for our aging population when it comes to quality of life, we need to take a more dyadic approach, looking at both partners,\\" said Sbarra, an associate professor in the UA Department of Psychology with joint appointments in Family Studies and Human Development (link sends e-mail) and the Evelyn F McKnight Brain Institute. The study was based on analysis of data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe, or SHARE study, of adults age 50 and older. The data was collected at three intervals over a six-year period, between 2004-2005 and 2010-2011. UA researchers considered survey respondents' self-reports of physical health and quality of life, as well as their scores on cognition tests measuring verbal fluency, word recall and delayed word recall. The UA study looked at health and cognition across a normal spectrum, rather than focusing on clinical cognitive disorders or chronic illnesses. The findings support existing research on the interdependence of older married couples, and they extend that research by identifying cognition and physical health as two specifically important factors that influence spouses' quality of life. Kyle Bourassa, a UA doctoral student in clinical psychology and the paper's lead author, said husbands' and wives' quality of life appears to be equally impacted by their spouse's physical health, with no differences across gender lines. In other words, a wife's physical health impacts her husband's quality of life as much as a husband's physical health affects his wife's quality of life. \\"If you have people whose physical health is low -- maybe they're suffering from an illness or unable to walk -- those kind of physical health issues not only impact the individual but the person they're married to as well,\\" Bourassa said. \\"Their husband or wife is the one who may have to adjust and help with their partner's new lifestyle.\\" With regard to cognition, wives' cognitive functioning appears to have as much of an effect of husbands' quality of life as husbands' own cognitive abilities. Wives' quality of life was not as strongly affected by their husbands' cognition, but there was a measurable impact, Bourassa said. Finally, changes in participants' self-reported overall quality of life at the three intervals in the SHARE survey varied similarly between husbands and wives, suggesting that change in one spouse's life quality over time parallels change in the other's. As adults age, changes in physical health can be a natural part of the process, as can cognitive decline, which can range from normal change in cognition to the onset of disorders such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease. As this change can vary dramatically between different people, it makes sense to look at both physical health and cognition as they relate to quality of life for both partners, Bourassa said. Additional research is needed to determine how changes in these two areas can change quality of life over time, he said. \\"The population of aging adults is going up drastically, and as we have more and more people who are living longer and longer it's really important to understand successful aging,\\" said Bourassa, whose co-authors on the paper included Sbarra and UA psychology doctoral students Molly Memel and Cindy Woolverton. Said Bourassa: \\"You could extend these findings to think about interventions targeting cognition and physical health to improve quality of life not only for the individual, but also for their partner.\\" ||||| Many things can impact older adults' quality of life. But two big ones, according to new research from the University of Arizona, are the health and cognitive functioning of their spouse. By analyzing data from more than 8,000 married couples (with an average age in the early 60s), researchers found that the physical health and cognitive functioning of a person's spouse can significantly affect someone's own quality of life. A press release quoted UA psychologist David Sbarra, a co-author of the paper, as saying, \\"When we think about quality of life for older adults, and improving quality of life, it seems like targeting the individual is only part of the story, and our findings suggest that for older adults, a larger part of individual well-being is defined by our partner's health and cognitive functioning as well.\\" The paper will be published in Psychology and Aging, a journal of the American Psychological Association. Sbarra urged \\"looking at both partners\\" when one partner develops serious health issues. The study underscores the need for caregiver relief and assistance. If a spouse is suffering from an illness or is unable to walk, their care frequently falls to the healthy spouse, who in turn must make their own lifestyle changes to accommodate their needs. UA researchers considered survey respondents' self-reports of physical health and quality of life, as well as their scores on cognition tests measuring verbal fluency, word recall and delayed word recall, said the release. Other studies have also bolstered the idea that caregivers' lives are deeply impacted by the illness of a loved one. Nearly 60 percent of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high; about 40 percent suffer from depression. Due to the physical and emotional toll of caregiving, Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers had 9.7 billion in additional health care costs of their own in 2014, reports the Alzheimer's Association. Caregiving is also costly. The total estimated aggregate of lost wages, pension, and Social Security benefits of people who care for their elderly parents is nearly 3 trillion, according to the MetLife Study of Caregiving Costs. |||||Summary:","response":"As the global population of older adults increases, discussions around successful aging, including physical, mental, and social well-being become more important. New research from the University of Arizona discovered that the health and cognitive functioning of an older person's spouse can significantly affect their own quality of life. The study found that physical health and cognitive functioning impact both husband and wife's quality of life equally, regardless of gender. When one spouse develops significant health issues, it's important to consider the needs of both partners in addressing quality-of-life concerns. This research supports the concept of providing relief and assistance for caregivers, whose well-being may be compromised when caring for a spouse with an illness or disability. This study, published in the American Psychological Association's journal Psychology and Aging, highlights the interdependence of older married couples in terms of health and cognitive functioning. The findings underscore the need for public health interventions targeting both cognition and physical health to not only improve an individual's quality of life but also their partner's. Given the drastic increase in the population of aging adults, understanding the factors that contribute to successful aging is essential, and considering the well-being of both partners involved in caregiving relationships is vital for developing effective interventions and support systems."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico.

Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. What is the relationship between 'carl hayden' and 'mesa'?

Justification: Art, especially abstract art, is open to interpretation by both the artist and the viewer. An artist's emotions and thoughts during the creative process are complex and can be influenced by various factors, such as personal experiences, surroundings, and even their subconscious mind. As a result, it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty the exact emotions and thoughts an artist experienced while creating their art. Additionally, because abstract art may not have a clear or definitive subject, interpretation is based on an individual's perception, adding further ambiguity to understanding the artist's original intent."},{"question":"In this task, given a sentence in the English language, your task is to convert it into the Bengali language.

In which Dickens novel does Daniel Quilp appear?","response":"Daniel Quilp appears in the Charles Dickens novel \\"The Old Curiosity Shop,\\" which was first published in serial form between 1840 and 1841. This novel tells the story of Nell Trent, a young girl, and her kind-hearted, older grandfather. The story revolves around their adventures and struggles as they attempt to keep their small shop solvent while dealing with various nefarious characters, including the menacing, unscrupulous moneylender, Daniel Quilp. Daniel Quilp is a cruel, cunning, and sadistic character in the novel, and he is frequently presented as a foil to the compassion and goodness displayed by Nell and her grandfather. Quilp is portrayed as a deformed, malicious dwarf who takes pleasure in the suffering and despair of others. He is relentless in pursuing Nell's grandfather, who owes him a considerable sum of money, and in harassing the innocent Nell herself. Throughout the narrative, Quilp's dark actions have far-reaching consequences for the characters in the story. His wickedness and the hardships he causes reflect the social injustices and hardships faced by many people during the Victorian era, a common theme in Dickens' work. Several subplots in \\"The Old Curiosity Shop\\" also involve Daniel Quilp, such as his twisted relationship with his wife Betsy, who is often the victim of his cruelty and abuse. Additionally, Quilp is linked to the character Sampson Brass, a corrupt lawyer who, together with his conniving sister, forms an alliance with Quilp to perpetrate further selfish and sinister actions. In conclusion, Daniel Quilp is a central antagonist in Charles Dickens' \\"The Old Curiosity Shop,\\" playing a significant role in driving the narrative and providing a stark contrast to the virtuous qualities embodied by the novel's protagonists, Nell and her grandfather. Quilp's presence in the story serves to shed light on pressing social issues of the time and to explore themes of morality, hardship, and the power dynamics that often dictate human relationships."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: W: I'd love to.

At the conclusion of this process, the bird has successfully established itself as an independent, mature adult, having undergone various key stages of growth, learning, and development. It is now ready to seek out food, shelter, and social interaction on its own, without the support and guidance of its parents. The bird will also be prepared to face predators and other challenges posed by its natural environment. As the mature bird continues living its life independently, it will start looking for a mate and engage in courtship rituals specific to its species. These rituals vary widely between species, but they often involve singing, elaborate displays, or specific physical interactions to attract the attention of potential mates. Once a mate is chosen, the mated pair will build a nest together in preparation for the next generation. The female bird will lay eggs, which both parents may care for through incubation (depending on the species). After the eggs have been incubated for the required period, new chicks will hatch – the beginning of an entirely new cycle of life for these young birds. This whole process repeats itself, allowing the bird's population to grow, adapt, and maintain its presence in the ecosystem. To summarize, the final step in the bird's life cycle is becoming independent and beginning its own life cycle, which includes finding a mate, reproducing, and caring for the future generations of its species. This process is essential for the survival and sustainability of the bird population in their environment, as well as contributing to the overall balance and health of the ecosystem in which they reside."},{"question":"Everyone surrounding the Nationals returned Wednesday to a question that has haunted the team since its days in Montreal: What do we do now?

Embarking on this journey is a conscious decision to immortalize your passion, your experiences, or the people you hold close to your heart. It's a statement, an armor you wear proudly on your skin. Therefore, creating the perfect tattoo sleeve involves careful planning, personalization, and collaboration with a skilled tattoo artist. In this guide, we will discuss how to choose the right images and symbols, work through sessions, explore continuity and color, and ultimately create a masterpiece that's an extension of your inner self. 1. Choosing Images and Symbols That Matter Most to You The first step in creating your tattoo sleeve is to brainstorm and explore images and symbols that hold personal significance. It's essential to dig deep, focus on your values, and consider your inspirations. You may find relevance in family crests, cultural designs, religious icons, or even illustrations of your favorite characters. Reflect on your life's important milestones, experiences you've had, or beliefs you firmly stand for, as these will lay the groundwork for your tattoo sleeve's theme. Make a list, draw out your ideas, or collect visual references to better envision your design. By focusing on images and symbols of personal meaning, your tattoo sleeve will inherently be unique and resonate with your essence. 2. Working in Sessions: Taking Your Time to Create the Perfect Sleeve Once you've gathered a collection of ideas, don't rush to get everything tattooed in one sitting. Breaking the process down into multiple sessions allows for a more refined design that accounts for several factors such as the natural contours of your body, pain tolerance, and healing time. It also ensures there's room for new ideas or modifications that evolve throughout the process. In collaboration with your chosen tattoo artist, break down the design into separate stages. Generally, tattoo artists will start with the outline, followed by shading and filling in, and finally, adding color. Depending on the complexity and size of your design, other stages might be necessary. Remember, great tattoos require patience. Allow each segment to heal before continuing the process. Proper healing will prevent complications and unwanted distortions of your intricate masterpiece. 3. Incorporating Patterns and Motifs for Continuity A well-designed tattoo sleeve possesses harmony and fluidity, where each individual piece seamlessly flows into the next. To achieve this visual cohesion, consider incorporating patterns or motifs that tie together different elements while maintaining a symmetry of sorts. Some popular choices include traditional tribal patterns, geometric shapes, floral motifs, or traditional Japanese elements. Think of how these patterns can be used as backgrounds, fillers, or foreground elements to create a sense of unity amidst various symbols. By weaving these motifs through your design, you create a stunning work of art while simultaneously maintaining the significance of each individual image. 4. Choosing Colors for Consistency and Personal Style Color is an essential element to consider while planning your tattoo sleeve. Your selected palette will contribute to the overall aesthetic and play a significant role in expressing your personality. To ensure consistency, stick to a limited color palette that's easily replicable by your tattoo artist. Explore color combinations that resonate with you and complement the design elements. You can opt for vibrant and bold colors or choose softer shades for a more subtle look. Discuss with your tattoo artist the types of ink they use and how those particular colors age over time. Your goal should be to have a color palette that maintains its vibrancy and allure even as time goes on. 5. Collaborating with a Skilled Tattoo Artist Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, selecting a skilled and experienced tattoo artist is crucial to turning your vision into a reality. Research and explore various artist portfolios to find someone who resonates with your desired style and has experience in executing sleeve tattoos. Share your ideas, sketches, and reference materials with your chosen artist during the consultation process. Together, you can create a design exclusively tailored to your taste and preferences. An experienced tattoo artist not only possesses technical skill but will also provide sound advice regarding the design, placement, and other aspects of your sleeve. Trust and open communication between you and your artist will undoubtedly pave the way for a breathtaking tattoo that exceeds your expectations. Conclusion Creating the perfect tattoo sleeve is a journey filled with reflection, creativity, and patience. Embark on this adventure with a clear vision, an open mind, and a skilled tattoo artist by your side. Your tattoo sleeve will be an expressive masterpiece that stands as a tribute to your story, your ideals, and your unique essence for all to witness."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Which English monarch was on the throne at the beginning of the Hundred Years War?","response":"The English monarch on the throne at the beginning of the Hundred Years War was King Edward III. Edward III was born on November 13, 1312, and ascended to the English throne on January 25, 1327, following the deposition of his father, King Edward II. His mother, Isabella of France, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, initially acted as regents for the young king. However, Edward III seized power in 1330, which marked the true beginning of his reign as a monarch. The Hundred Years War, a series of protracted conflicts, was fought between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France from 1337 to 1453. Although it is commonly referred to as a singular war, it essentially comprised numerous battles, skirmishes, and campaigns between the two nations throughout that period. The war erupted mainly due to the tensions between the Plantagenet dynasty ruling England and the Valois dynasty ruling France over territorial claims and the issue of the French throne. The war's commencement is often linked with the situation that arose when Philip VI came to power in France in 1328. Edward III chose to contend the Valois claim to France's throne, asserting that his own claim through his mother Isabella of France (Philip IV's daughter) superseded the Valois claim. This stemmed from the assertion that Edward should inherit the title through his mother's line despite the French application of the Salic law, which precluded succession through female lines. In 1337, Philip VI of France confiscated Guyenne, a territory in southwestern France, from Edward, igniting the dispute into open conflict. The Hundred Years War consisted of three main phases. During the first phase (1337-1360), Edward III had significant military successes and even took the French king, John II, as his prisoner. The iconic Battle of Crécy and Battle of Poitiers occurred during this period. The second phase, also known as the Caroline War (1369-1389), was characterized by the resurgence of French power under King Charles V, ultimately pushing back the English, and his successor Charles VI maintained the French position. The third and final phase (1415-1453), was marked by the rise of King Henry V, who succeeded in asserting the English claims once again. However, after his death, the French, with Joan of Arc's intervention, would regain key territories, culminating with the recapture of Bordeaux in 1453 and effectively ending the war. In conclusion, King Edward III was on the English throne at the onset of the Hundred Years War, a conflict that spanned over a century and determined the balance of power between England and France throughout the Late Middle Ages."},{"question":"Answer the following question: You are presented with the quiz \\"What forms caverns by seeping through rock and dissolving limestone?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Understand the statement The statement claims that laziness did not exist before the invention of television in the mid 20th century. Step 2: Define Laziness Laziness is a human trait that is characterized by the unwillingness to work or use one's energy. It is not directly related to any specific invention or device. Step 3: Investigate historical context of laziness The concept of laziness has existed throughout human history, in both religious texts and work environments, well before the invention of television. For example, the seven deadly sins in Christianity, dating back centuries, include the sin of \\"sloth,\\" which represents laziness. Step 4: Consider the impact of the television While the invention of television in the mid 20th century may have provided an opportunity for people to engage in more sedentary activities, it cannot be solely credited with the existence of laziness. Again, laziness is a human trait that has persisted throughout history, indepedently of technology like television. Conclusion: Based on the reasoning above, the statement \\"There was no such thing as Laziness until the invention of the television in the mid 20th century\\" is false. Laziness has existed throughout human history, and television is just one of many factors that may contribute to its expression."},{"question":"This question has options. Does the word \\"call\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? The salesman's call on a customer. That sound is the distinctive call of the cuckoo bird. Available choices: 1). different meanings. 2). the same meaning.","response":"1). different meanings. In the two given sentences, the word \\"call\\" conveys different meanings. Although the word \\"call\\" appears in both sentences, the context of each sentence indicates distinctive interpretations of the term. In the first sentence, \\"The salesman's call on a customer,\\" the word \\"call\\" refers to a visit or formal meeting with the purpose of discussing business or acquiring sales. In this context, \\"call\\" can be synonymous with a business appointment, a consultation, or an encounter. The sentence implies that the salesman is visiting a customer, likely to present a product or service, negotiate a deal, or maintain a client relationship. By contrast, the second sentence, \\"That sound is the distinctive call of the cuckoo bird,\\" utilizes the term \\"call\\" to describe a vocalization or sound produced by a bird. In this context, \\"call\\" is often associated with the unique sounds that birds make to communicate with each other or identify themselves, like their song or alarm signal. Here, the sentence indicates that the particular sound belongs to the cuckoo bird and is characteristic of the species. Thus, the word \\"call\\" conveys different meanings in the provided sentences: a business visit in the first and a vocalization in the second, clearly demonstrating that the two sentences involve distinct interpretations of the term."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. There are strong arguments on either side — both for and against clipping. Those who caution against it say that birds were meant to fly and we should not interfere with a parrot’s natural inclinations. Clipping the parrot's wings deprives them of this basic freedom. Consider other options first. If you are planning to show your bird, it should never be clipped. Parrots respond very well to clicker training, and you can train your parrot to return to you when called. You can also use clicker training to modify unwanted behaviors, which can help your parrot stay happy and safe. If you are not willing to do the work to train a parrot, then you may want to reconsider if getting a bird is right for you. There are some dangers to letting your bird fly free in your home. They can potentially damage their feathers, knock things over, and consume things that they should not. Many household items can be dangerous to parrots, including toilets and other standing water, lightbulbs and stoves that get hot, ceiling fans, cords to blinds, and windows and mirrors. Ask yourself why you want a bird if you don't want it to fly or don't feel that your home is a safe environment. Consider that a different pet may be more appropriate. Parrots are quick and can take advantage of any open door or window to get out. Once outside, it may be difficult to get bird back if you have not trained them. With clipped wings, the chance of escape is reduced. And if your bird does get out, it’s much easier to get them back. Bird wings should not be clipped until the bird can fly. Clipping too early can stunt the regular growth of the feathers. If you’ve never done it before, it’s advisable to have your vet do it the first time. That way you can see how it works and then decide if you want to continue to do it at home. Summary:","response":"Clipping a parrot's wings is a controversial issue with strong arguments on either side, as it can deprive birds of their natural inclination to fly, yet reduce chances of escape and injury; proper training and considering alternative pets are crucial factors for potential bird owners to consider."},{"question":"Toisaalta heillä on aitoja ja todellisia huolenaiheita, jotka ymmärrän ja joiden vuoksi tunnen heitä kohtaan suurta myötätuntoa.

A doubling of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon will cause more or less isomers? The answer is:","response":"As the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon increases, the number of possible isomers also increases. A doubling of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon will cause more isomers. Isomers are molecules with different molecular structures but with the same molecular formula. They have different arrangements of atoms due to differences in connectivity or orientation. In the case of hydrocarbons, which are made up of only carbon and hydrogen atoms, there are three types of isomers: structural (constitutional) isomers, cis-trans (geometric) isomers, and conformational isomers. When the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon doubles, the number of isomers increases significantly because of the increased possibilities for different atom arrangements and connectivity. This leads to a larger number of structural isomers, and in the case of unsaturated hydrocarbons (containing double or triple bonds), it can also lead to an increase in cis-trans isomers. Consequently, a doubling of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon will result in more isomers."},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: Market strategist Phil Dow believes distinctions exist \\"between the current market malaise\\" and the Great Depression.

Let's break down the elements and expressions mentioned in the review to provide a more detailed understanding of the critic's opinion: 1. \\"Sun-drenched masterpiece\\" – The use of the word \\"masterpiece\\" suggests that the critic regards the movie as a work of high artistic merit, and the adjective \\"sun-drenched\\" adds a beautiful and warm aura to the film's overall atmosphere. Using positive qualifiers like this one implies that the critic admires the movie's visual and aesthetic appeal. 2. \\"Part parlor game\\" – Describing the movie in part as a parlor game indicates that the critic sees it as engaging and entertaining, employing clever plot devices or intellectual playfulness. The term \\"parlor game\\" suggests there might be a sense of fun, with characters trying to outwit one another, and the audience being drawn into the enjoyable challenge the game presents. 3. \\"Part psychological case study\\" – Labeling the movie as a psychological case study implies that it dives into the deeper intricacies of the human mind and emotions. This further showcases the film's depth and complexity, touching on themes that the critic likely finds fascinating and thought-provoking. The combination of these elements – visual appeal, lively entertainment, and intellectual depth – indicates that the critic views the movie in a positive light.

(D). continues doing tricks with her arms out and then stands back up onto the bars and begins performing her routine on the beams.Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows?

Explanation: The girl is performing a routine on the uneven bars in a gym, so it's natural that she continues doing her routine and ends it in a way like jumping off the side and waving to the audience. (A) is incorrect because jumping up and down repeatedly doesn't sound like a natural way to end a gymnastics routine on the uneven bars.

Step 1: Reading the text carefully The text seems to be a comment about a film, specifically expressing surprises about its ranking and praising Al Pacino's performance. Step 2: Identifying positive or negative words and phrases - \\"mysteries of the modern world\\": could be eiter positive or negative depending on the context - \\"NOT considered... top 100 films of all time\\": negative, implies disbelief and disagreement - \\"wonderful\\": positive - \\"Al Pacino's performance is as good as it gets\\": positive Step 3: Checking for sarcasm or irony The first phrase, \\"Surely one of the mysteries of the modern world!!\\", seems to have a sarcastic tone, as the exclamation marks and the phrase itself convey disbelief or bewilderment. This enhances the negative aspect of the movie not being in the top 100 films. Step 4: Assessing the overall tone and sentiment Considering the context, the presence of both positive and negative words and phrases, and the presence of sarcasm in the text, the overall sentiment can be described as \\"mixed\\".

The focus is steadily moving away from the traditional emphasis on higher education and turning towards primary education. Indeed, politicians, educators, and parents alike have been prescribing a veritable \\"Primary Push.\\" But why is primary education now gaining such significance? Let's delve deeper into the factors and forces that are driving this change and how it is reshaping the global educational landscape. The Changing World and Economy One of the primary reasons for the \\"Primary Push\\" is the rapidly changing world and economy. The knowledge-based economy of today demands a highly skilled and versatile workforce. It has become imperative to lay a strong foundation of learning, right from the primary level, to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate the various challenges they will encounter in their academic, professional, and personal lives. With the development of cutting-edge technology, increased automation and artificial intelligence, the demand for creative and critical-thinking skills has shot up manifold. To thrive, compete, and innovate in this environment, it is of utmost importance to instill a love of learning, curiosity, and adaptability in children from a young age. Inclusive Education and Equity in Access One of the significant challenges faced by nations in the 21st century is the issue of educational equity and inclusive education for all. The \\"Primary Push\\" plays an indispensable role in addressing these concerns. By prioritizing resources, attention, and funds towards primary education, governments ensure that the foundational years of learning become accessible to children from all walks of life, irrespective of their socio-economic backgrounds. The absence of a solid foundation in primary education not only hampers their scholastic achievement but has far-reaching consequences for their future lives and career prospects. Ensuring equity and access in primary education is critical to breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion that has plagued marginalized communities for far too long. Boosting Human Development Index Another significant driver behind the \\"Primary Push\\" is the growing recognition of the pivotal role of primary education in improving the Human Development Index (HDI). Primary education significantly impacts the key indicators of HDI – income, education, and overall quality of life. By focusing on primary education, nations strive to create a more educated and skilled workforce, which, in turn, contributes to a higher GDP per capita and economic growth. UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goals UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have center-staged the importance of inclusive and equitable quality primary education. In particular, Goal 4 of the SDGs seeks to \\"ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all.\\" By 2030, the goal is to achieve universal access to free primary and secondary education for all children worldwide. Consequently, governments across the globe have taken up this mandate and have started directing resources and attention towards primary education to meet this ambitious target. Long-term Benefits and Return on Investment Last but not least, mounting evidence from various studies and empirical analysis showcases the benefits of investing in primary education. From increased economic growth, better health outcomes, improved gender equality to reduced crime rates, the long-term benefits of equitable primary education far outweigh the investment costs. It is evident that the focus on primary education is not only a matter of policy and global commitment but also a sound investment with a high return ratio. By investing in primary education, nations can create a substantial ripple effect of positive social, economic, and human development outcomes. Conclusion The \\"Primary Push\\" is an indispensable move in today's rapidly changing world and economy. Key drivers, such as inclusive education, equity in access, the impact on human development index, UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goals, and demonstrated long-term benefits, underscore its overall relevance and importance. By continuing to prioritize primary education, we are laying a strong foundation for children worldwide, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in a competitive global landscape and paving the way for a brighter and more equitable future for all."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

In the small village of Nólsoy, Faroe Islands, a significant event took place between the 3rd and 5th of November in the year 1945. During these days, an unidentified male was observed roaming around the village, catching the attention of the local inhabitants. The arrival and presence of this mysterious individual stirred up excitement and curiosity among the villagers, as it was not a common occurrence for new visitors to explore their quiet, remote island. Nólsoy, a small island located in the Faroe Islands archipelago, is characterized by its picturesque landscapes, welcoming locals, and a strong sense of community, making it a unique place to live or visit. In the 1940s, Nólsoy was an even more isolated location, with a smaller population and limited resources, which is why the sighting of an unfamiliar person was such a remarkable occurrence for the villagers. Though not much is known about the male that was observed, his presence was significant enough to be noted as a historical event. It is possible that he was a traveler who had come to Nólsoy for work or adventure, or he may have had personal connections with some of the villagers. Regardless of his reasons for being in Nólsoy, the very presence of this unknown individual during those November days of 1945 is bound to have sparked conversations and fostered speculation among the island’s residents. Despite any details being unknown about the mysterious male, this event serves as a reminder of the allure and intrigue that surrounds small, isolated communities such as Nólsoy. The excitement generated by the arrival of a stranger highlights the social dynamics and tight-knit bonds within these communities, and how even the smallest of occurrences can have a lasting impact. As time has passed since that November in 1945, the event has been woven into the collective memory of Nólsoy’s inhabitants and possibly shared as a local tale, showcasing the power of stories to build and preserve a community’s history."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context tweet, a question and corresponding answer of given question.

Movie plot title: One Eight Seven Movie plot: Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the police code for homicide) on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.Fifteen months after surviving from the ordeal, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a rowdy, unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" Chacón, a menacing felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but which is stymied by Garfield's diffident and destabilizing behavior, likely arising from post-traumatic stress disorder and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past also garners him the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, a burned-out, alcoholic history teacher who carries and keeps guns at the school.After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he inexplicably disappears, and Benny's severely unstable tag partner, César, takes over as leader and class antagonist. The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. César, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dog with a \\"dead\\" face, is shot with a syringe...

In the movie plot of \\"One Eight Seven,\\" the number 187 is used as a threat by the student Dennis Broadway, who writes it on every page of one of Garfield's textbooks.

Simply double the ingredients to make 2 cups of coffee instead of 1. Continue adding ingredients in proportion to make the amount of coffee you want. Use the coffee’s weight to quickly find out how much water to use. Measure the coffee’s weight in ounces using a scale, then multiply that number by 16. This tells you how many fluid ounces of water you need. For grams, multiply the coffee’s weight by 16.6945. This gives you the amount of cubic centimeters of water to use. Everyone enjoys coffee in a different way, so the standard cup may taste weak to you. If this is the case, add some extra beans or a small scoop of grounds to your next brew. As long as you keep the amount of water the same, the coffee will come out stronger. For weaker coffee, use the normal amount of grounds or beans. Add more water to dilute the taste. Keep track of how much water you add so that you can recreate the perfect cup of coffee after you figure out what ratio works best for you.

Mr.... ||||| The fact that home-grown suicide bombers known to the authorities were able to hit Brussels precisely at a time when the city was saturated with police and intelligence services hunting terrorists has led to soul-searching in Belgium. There could be no denying mistakes had been made when two ministers offered to resign over failings in the tracking of the Bakraoui brothers, who blew themselves up on Tuesday at the airport and metro. The prime minister, Charles Michel, refused to allow the key ministers to stand down. Nevertheless, there was a damning revelation that one of the suicide bombers, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, who Belgian authorities initially said was known only for criminality, had in fact been flagged by Turkey as a “foreign terrorist fighter” last year and deported to the Netherlands. Experts in the intelligence community warned that outright “Belgium bashing” from abroad was not going to help matters. France, which is itself facing criticism at home over failings in preventing terrorist attacks, had to calm a potential diplomatic spat after its finance minister, Michel Sapin, accused Belgian officials of a “lack of will” and “maybe also a kind of naivety” in failing to handle the spread of radical Islam. Belgian ministers offer to resign after criticism over Brussels attacks Read more The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, jumped to Belgium’s defence, dismissing accusations that it was a “failed state”. The task of unpicking exactly what type of gap in intelligence that the surveillance-savvy and well-organised bombers were able to slip through will take time, but it holds the key to preventing further Islamic State attacks. There is a long list of potential failings to consider. The first is how Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, who had skipped parole after serving less than half of a nine-year sentence for armed robbery, was able to leave for Syria and then be deported from Turkey as a “foreign terrorist fighter” without his domestic authorities noticing he was a militant. At the time of the Brussels attacks, he and his brother were actively being hunted by police following a raid on a terrorist hideout in Brussels connected to November’s Paris attacks. It is not certain whether the Bakraoui brothers were the two men known to have fled from a flat across rooftops, eluding police snipers. Only four days before the Brussels attacks, Europe’s most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, the prime suspect in the Paris attacks that killed 130 people, had been cornered in Brussels. Police knew other dangerous suspects remained on the run, yet the Brussels bombers, who were linked to the Paris attacks, escaped detection. Najim Laachraoui, who is believed to have been the second Brussels airport suicide bomber, had been wanted by police since December over the Paris attacks, though under a false identity that was only unmasked last week. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ibrahim el-Bakraoui after his arrest in Turkey last year. Photograph: AP Laachraoui, who is thought to have been the Paris attacks’ bomb-maker, went to Syria in September 2013 in one of the first waves of jihadis to leave Belgium for the country. In February, a Belgian court convicted him in absentia for his involvement with Isis. “If you put all things in a row, you can ask yourself major questions,” said the Belgian interior minister, Jan Jambon. “When an attack happens, it by definition means there has been a failure,” Thomas Renard, a terrorism expert at the Egmont Institute, a Brussels-based thinktank, told the Guardian. It is unlikely that Belgium underestimated the overall threat from terrorism and jihadis returning from fighting abroad. For several years, it has been on the frontline of terrorist cells in northern Europe and was well aware of the danger. Per capita, Belgium is Isis’s most fertile recruiting ground in Europe. After November’s attacks in Paris, Belgian authorities shut down Brussels for almost a week, closing schools, offices and cultural centres, cancelling sporting events and putting the army on the streets as there were fears an attack was imminent. But questions will be asked about whether Belgian analysis of specific threats was correct and whether it was watching the right people. “It will be a long time before we know exactly what happened,” Renard said. “There is a question about whether they didn’t take the full measure of attacks being prepared in Belgium, or whether the role of certain individuals was missed. “Or perhaps they focused on individuals considered most dangerous and missed the bigger picture of other figures involved. They could have underestimated the size and scope of the cell.” This appeared to have earlier been the case with Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the ringleader of the Paris attacks. He was linked to the terrorist cell that was raided in Verviers near the Belgian-German border in January last year, in which the Belgian authorities said they had foiled an imminent attack. Yet Abaaoud’s importance did not seem to register, he escaped the net and later led the Paris attacks. Belgium’s difficulties in reconciling its French and Flemish-speaking communities were illustrated five years ago when it broke the modern-day world record for the longest time failing to form a government. It has so many layers of local and federal authority that information can slip through the gaps. The Brussels-born Abdeslam brothers involved in the Paris attacks were noticed by local police as having been radicalised and as potentially dangerous but when the information was transferred to federal police it appeared to get lost. Belgian intelligence staff have been evaluated positively by foreign intelligence services. “They’re good,” said Bernard Squarcini, a former head of French counter-intelligence, but he felt there were not enough of them. Figures are confidential but it is thought that between 600 and 800 people work in civil intelligence and up to 800 work in military intelligence – with perhaps about 500 devoted to tackling Isis. That could equate to a ratio of three officers per jihadi suspect who is considered dangerous. Permanent telephone or human surveillance needs more people than that. Last month the Belgian government announced a €400m (£315m) programme to combat “terrorism and radicalisation” that included the hiring of 1,000 additional police, prosecutors, state security agents and other personnel. As far back as November, Michel, the prime minister, said: “We have to do more, and we have to do better.” After this week’s attacks, those words seem more pertinent than ever. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"In the wake of the attacks in Brussels and the ensuing manhunt, more people with terror links have been arrested whilst Belgium has come under fire for the failings of its counter-terrorism activities.

Today, David Wolman of The New Yorker reports that 30 million of the new 100 bills were incorrectly produced, and so the Federal Reserve might have to delay the bills' release once again. It's another embarrassing problem for the Federal Reserve, which budgeted for the bills' release, and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which was responsible for its production. (Appropriately, the bureau's website is named moneyfactory.gov.) The bills' release in October can still be salvaged if the Fort Worth, Texas branch of production makes up for the problems at the Washington, D.C. mint printer, but that timetable might not be feasible. Update: A spokesperson for the Bureau says that despite \\"concerns during production validation\\" at the D.C. branch, the fulfillment of the complete money order to the Federal Reserve remains on schedule for this fall. Importantly, though, the problem won't cost the government that much to fix, even though the bills represent 3 billion. Because the defective bills were not approved for release to the public, the cost of this faulty episode won't approach that number. Certainly, the production of new bills and disposal of the defective bills will cost taxpayers. Exactly how much will this error cost? With some back-of-the-napkin calculations, we came to a cost of 3.79 million. Let's go through that process. The old 100 bill cost just 7.8 cents to make, according to the Fed, but the newer version's state-of-the-art features — including a 3D security ribbon, color-changing liberty bell, and watermarks galore — will surely increase the cost of production. The Fed's budget plan lists the new 100 at 12.6 cents per bill, which comes near an estimate in a 2010 article in The Washington Post that the new Benjamins would cost about 12 cents to produce. Now let's do some basic math. 12.6 cents, or .126 dollars, multiplied by 30 million defective bills, comes out to wasted production cost of 3.78 million. So production of 30 million replacement 100-dollar bills will only cost about .1% of the value of those bills. In addition, there are the costs of disposal of the defective money. A 2011 article in The Atlantic explains that about 6 billion bills are disposed every year. With 37 regional Fed banks, this comes to about 160 million bills per branch. In a 1997 article in The New York Times, an executive at the Fed branch in Los Angeles said disposal of his undisclosed amount of bills amounted to 60,000 annually. Let's assume that all Fed branches pay the same amount for money disposal (again, these are estimates). Using proportions, we see that if disposal of 160 million bills costs 60 grand, then disposal of 30 million 100-dollar bills will cost 12,000. That 12,000 cost is not that much compared to the previous 3.78 million estimation, and added together, we now come to a cost of about 3.79 million dollars for disposal of defective bills and production of new ones. There are, in addition, costs for employees, overtime, and inspections, but the simple cost of disposing the defective bills and introducing the new ones won't be terribly costly for taxpayers. Pretty strange to consider that all the money in your wallet isn't worth much, no? And therein lies the truly important cost of the error, as Wolman notes: \\"It threatens to injure the aura—the almightiness—of the dollar that enables most people to go about their business without ever stopping to examine the bills in their hand or to contemplate what gives them value. The only thing conferring value on those dollars, of course, is trust in other people’s trust in them, which is both weird and magnificent.\\" Yes, trust in money is all that matters here. Which is why the continued bungling by the Fed and Bureau to produce new 100 bills is concerning, though not for the small monetary costs of the error.

Eric Levenson ||||| For the past few years, the Federal Reserve has been preparing to introduce a redesigned hundred-dollar bill into circulation. It will have a Liberty Bell that changes color, a new hidden message on Ben Franklin’s collar, and tiny 3-D images that move when you tilt the bill this way or that. But delay has followed delay. And now again: The New Yorker has learned that another production snafu has taken place at one of the country’s two currency factories, according to a document from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The cause of the latest blunder is something known as “mashing,” according to Darlene Anderson, a spokeswoman for the bureau. When too much ink is applied to the paper, the lines of the artwork aren’t as crisp as they should be, like when a kid tries to carefully color inside the lines—using watercolors and a fat paintbrush. Anderson said this happens “infrequently.” Still, this foul-up is only the latest embarrassment for the bureau. The redesigned hundred-dollar bill was meant to be released in early 2011, but has been delayed for the past two years because of a massive printing error, separate from the recent mashing problem, in which some notes were left with a blank spot. This time, recent batches of cash from the Washington, D.C., plant contained “clearly unacceptable” bills intermixed with passable ones, according to a July memo to employees from Larry Felix, the bureau’s director. So the Fed is returning more than thirty million hundred-dollar notes and demanding its money back, Felix wrote. Another thirty billion dollars’ worth of paper sits in limbo awaiting examination, and Fed officials have informed the bureau that they will not accept any hundred-dollar notes made at the Washington, D.C., facility until further notice. Felix’s letter says internal quality-control measures should have prevented the bureau “from delivering defective work,” and that those responsible would be held accountable. The bureau now has to race to meet an October 8th deadline for delivering the year’s cash orders and to finally get the new hundred-dollar bill into circulation as promised. To that end, Felix has ordered the country’s other money factory, in Fort Worth, Texas, to accelerate its efforts. “There are dire consequences involved here because BEP sells Federal Reserve notes to the Board to finance our entire operation,” he wrote in the memo. “If the BEP does not meet the order, the BEP does not get paid.” The financial toll from the recent bungle is tough to know: the Treasury and the Fed have little interest in calculating it, let alone being transparent about it. Still, the direct cost probably isn’t greater than the sum of what the bureau pumps out in a few days. “Central banks are a bit like other businesses,” said Ben Mazzotta, a researcher at the Fletcher School’s Institute for Business in the Global Context who focusses on the costs of different forms of money. “They can draw down inventories or order additional product.” There are other costs, though. Taxpayers will have to pay to inspect, correct, produce, transport, and secure all the additional money that will replace the botched notes. Disposing of the bad bills? That’s on taxpayers, too, as are the additional hours spent making up for the mistake by employees of the bureau. A possible greater cost of these scrip shenanigans is diminished confidence in the greenback. The situation is akin to a magician getting caught unloading a crate of bunnies from the back of his truck. It threatens to injure the aura—the almightiness—of the dollar that enables most people to go about their business without ever stopping to examine the bills in their hand or to contemplate what gives them value. The only thing conferring value on those dollars, of course, is trust in other people’s trust in them, which is both weird and magnificent. David Wolman is a contributing editor at Wired.

The Federal Reserve has had to delay the release due to problems at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which was responsible for producing the new bills. While the financial cost of the errors is relatively small, the repeated problems with getting the new bill into circulation are seen as potentially damaging to trust in the US dollar."},{"question":"Where are there very famous churchyard?

Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Question: Why did the twins sell the house? Options: A. It was too large for the two of them. B. Neither wanted to set a foot it in again. C. So they could invest in other real estate.

What is the solution?","response":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like we're talking to a 5-year-old. We have a math problem that looks like this: -562*z = -275*z - 282*z Think of the letter 'z' as a bag of candies, and we want to know how many candies are in the bag. First, let's look at the right side of the equation. We have -275*z and -282*z. Imagine that you have -275 bags of candies and -282 bags of candies, and you want to put them all together. So, you add them up: -275 + (-282) = -557. Now our equation looks like this: -562*z = -557*z Now, to find out how many candies are in each bag (z), we will divide both sides of the equation by the number in front of the 'z', which in this case is -557. So we will divide -562 by -557. When you divide two negative numbers, the answer will be positive. -562 / -557 = 1.00897 (rounded to 5 decimal places) Now we know that each bag (z) has about 1.00897 candies in it. So, z is approximately 1.00897."},{"question":"- position is midfielder - nationalcaps is 3 - currentclub is retired - nationalyears is 1991 - nationalgoals is 0 - birth date is 11 november 1964 - fullname is miguel Ángel sanabria - nationalteam is paraguay - birth place is luque , paraguay Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.","response":"Based on the provided information, it appears that this information is about Miguel Ángel Sanabria, a retired Paraguayan footballer who played as a midfielder.

I comment 'GREAT, now you can validate that today is her birthday!' He checks her ID and hands it back to her - almost snubbed her. WHA? So he takes my son-in-laws order - Heart of Stone Marg and is blaze' on the whole thing, then gets to me and is extremely pleasant. I ordered wine, started with the Hullabaloo Zin very nice. What I found almost rude / offensive was the lack of interest he showed with everyone but me! That was completely strange!!! I will say, I expected him to - at minimum - tell my daughter happy birthday! Ok - we chatter about it and decide server #3036 is just being different. We will happily move on ... Time to order our meal - I have a few questions which were addressed very politely and enthusiastically. My daughter asked a question and was treated as if 'everyone should know that' ....what is going on here?? My son-in-law asks about his preferred dish and he too was treated foolishly. Hummmm ....I wondered if the kindness was directed to where the wallet is?? That was the only thing I could figure out ...server #3036 was only kind to the person paying?? seriously??? hummmm The birthday girl got the Filet Mignon - it was cooked perfectly - the side of mashed potatoes were 'fine'. son-in-law got the Giant Prawn and was content with it ...he could have used a bit more food on his plate (luckily we ordered a side of Green Chili Mac - very good!). My order was the Corn flaked Halibut - very very delish!! If I was a judge on the food network channel, I would have commented that the fish was slightly over cooked - but since I'm not a tv judge - I'm refraining from the comment! : ) *warning - they serve 'black quinoa' as a side with the halibut -- its really a kinda creepy grain ...tried it and did NOT like it' * I did ask #3036 to recommend a white wine with my dish - he was a bit befuddled (i don't think we use that word enough!) and eventually came up with 'Pares Balta' Chard -- it was AMAZING.... very perfectly paired! We closed off the birthday celebration with Lemon Genoise for my daughter, Frozen Ovaltine for s-i-l and I opted for the ol' standby, Creme Brulee. Lemon Genoise was gross (to me), my daughter said it was as it should be -- flavors blended better as it got to room temperature. It is topped with 'panes' of clear sugar pieces standing in the cake - we were told 'oh, it's only sugar'. Apparently we looked as though we were going to send it back because we had 'glass shards' atop the dessert?!?! The Frozen Ovaltine was -- chocolate .... The Creme Brulee was very well done - just the right texture, flavors and had a lovely side of berry / nut mix that went great alone or with the Brulee. Ok - so why 2 stars?

It was the first comic book written, drawn, and produced entirely by African-American creators, and it aimed to represent Black characters and culture in an authentic and positive light. Created by Orrin Cromwell Evans, a pioneering journalist and newspaper editor, All Negro Comics was a response to the absence and misrepresentation of African Americans in the predominantly white mainstream comic book industry of that era. The premiere and only issue of All Negro Comics featured several Black characters and stories across various genres, such as crime-fighting, adventure, and humor. Some of the central characters and stories in the issue included: 1. Ace Harlem – A skilled and courageous Black detective who fought crime and solved mysteries. 2. The Little Dew Dillies – A group of mischievous and fun-loving children engaged in humorous antics. 3. Sugarfoot - A light-hearted comedy about two roaming musicians, one being a lovable rogue and the other, a straight man. 4. Lion Man - A hero with a superhero vibe, who was a college-educated African-American sent to Africa to protect a valuable mineral deposit, defend the people, and fight against evildoers. Despite the success and critical acclaim of All Negro Comics, various factors, including financial challenges and alleged racial bias in the distribution system, prevented the release of subsequent issues. However, this pioneering comic remains an essential milestone in the history of the comic book industry, as it marked an early effort to challenge both the racial exclusion and the stereotyping that was widespread at that time. The significance of All Negro Comics lies in its contribution to increasing representation and diversity within the world of comics and paving the way for future Black comic creators and characters."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: David got five exercise tips from his personal trainer, tip A, tip B, tip C, tip D, and tip E. Tip A involves weight lifting, but tip B does not involve weight lifting. Tip C involves running, but tip D does not involve running. Finally, tip E does not involve any exercise at all. David has to find out which tips are most useful for him. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which tip the skeletal muscle would not be bigger, tip A or tip B? A:","response":"Based on the information provided, it is important to first understand the primary difference between tip A and tip B. Tip A involves weight lifting, while tip B does not involve weight lifting. When determining which tip is less likely to result in bigger skeletal muscles, it is essential to take into account the effect of the exercise type on muscle growth. Muscle hypertrophy, or the increase in muscle size, occurs when the body adapts to external stress, such as resistance training. This process involves the growth of muscle fibers and the number of muscle cells, leading to increased muscle mass. Weight lifting, as part of tip A, is a form of resistance training that specifically targets the development of muscle strength and size. By breaking down and rebuilding muscle fibers, weight lifting stimulates muscle growth, resulting in an increase in skeletal muscle size. On the other hand, tip B does not involve weight lifting. While the exact form of exercise involved in tip B is not specified in the paragraph, it is clear that it does not include resistance training. As a result, tip B is less likely to focus on promoting muscle growth. Based on this information, it can be concluded that the skeletal muscles would not be bigger in tip B compared to tip A. It is important for David to understand his personal fitness goals and to consult his personal trainer to determine the most appropriate exercise routine to achieve those goals, as the utility of the different tips will ultimately depend on his individual needs and preferences."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.

Hypothesis: The sun appears often in iceland during the winter","response":"After reading and analyzing the given paragraph, we can evaluate the hypothesis presented: 'The sun appears often in Iceland during the winter.' The paragraph states that, according to a recent study, there is no evidence of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in Iceland where the sun does not appear for a long time in the winter. In order to examine the hypothesis, it is crucial to understand the context and background information. Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression that is related to the changes in seasons. It usually starts and ends at the same time each year. In most cases, SAD begins in the fall and continues throughout the winter months, causing symptoms such as low energy, sleep problems, and feelings of depression and hopelessness. The condition has been linked to the reduced exposure to sunlight, which may cause an imbalance in serotonin and melatonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, and melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep patterns. Considering the relationship between seasonal affective disorder and sunlight exposure, one might assume that if SAD is not prevalent in a particular region, it could mean that the sun appears relatively often in that region during the winter months, providing adequate sunlight exposure to prevent the occurrence of SAD. In the context of the given paragraph, the absence of seasonal affective disorder in Iceland is mentioned. This might indirectly suggest that there could be enough sunlight exposure during the winter months in Iceland to prevent the population from experiencing SAD. However, it is important to note that the paragraph specifically mentions that the sun does not appear for a long time in the winter in the region. This statement contradicts the hypothesis, as it indicates that the sun does not appear often in Iceland during the winter months. It is crucial to consider other factors before concluding the accuracy of the hypothesis. For instance, the population of Iceland may have developed adaptive strategies and coping mechanisms to handle the long winter months without much sunlight exposure. The genetic makeup, lifestyle habits, and cultural practices in Iceland could all be potential factors that contribute to the reduced occurrence of seasonal affective disorder, despite the limited sunlight exposure. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis that 'The sun appears often in Iceland during the winter' cannot be considered true. The paragraph contradicts the hypothesis by stating that the sun does not appear for a long time during the winter in Iceland, and the absence of SAD in the region could be attributed to other factors unrelated to sunlight exposure."},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: 40 out of 5 based on 52 reviews","response":"40 out of 5, based on 52 reviews."},{"question":"Euroopan komissio on antanut ehdotuksen 18 viikosta.

What is the easiest way to become a celebrity?","response":"No, the following two questions are not the same. While both questions pertain to achieving celebrity status, they focus on different paths and may lead to distinct outcomes. Let's break down each question in more detail and highlight the differences: 1. How do you become a celebrity artist? This question specifically centers on gaining fame and success through artistic endeavors. A celebrity artist can refer to various art forms, including music, painting, acting, dance, or any other creative discipline. In order to provide a detailed answer, I will discuss some general steps to attain this goal: a. Find your passion and talent: Determine the art form in which you excel and are most passionate about. This might involve exploring different genres or styles before settling on your preferred artistic expression. b. Train and practice: Seek education and training in your chosen field to develop your skills and knowledge. Attend workshops, classes, or seek mentorship from established artists. Regular practice is essential to hone your craft, and it helps in refining your skills and growing as an artist. c. Develop a unique style and identity: Find your unique voice and stand out from the crowd. This involves creating distinctive and recognizable work that sets you apart from other artists within your genre. d. Showcase your work: Start displaying your art in local exhibitions, galleries, or events. Create an online presence to reach a wider audience, including having a dedicated website and social media presence. Share your artwork and engage with your audience regularly. e. Network and collaborate: Establish connections with established artists and figures within the art industry. Networking is critical in gaining recognition. Collaboration with other artists can lead to further exposure and diverse opportunities. f. Stay consistent and persistent: The journey to becoming a celebrity artist is usually long and challenging. You must be willing to work hard and adapt as you encounter obstacles on your way to success. 2. What is the easiest way to become a celebrity? On the other hand, this question focuses on seeking fame and recognition in the broadest sense, without specifying the means or field. Here are some general paths that people may consider when aiming for celebrity status: a. Entertainment industry: Pursue a career in the entertainment industry, such as acting, singing, or dancing. Acquire proper training, audition for roles or gigs, and work hard to get your big break in the industry. b. Social media stardom: With the rise of social media platforms, many people gain fame through building a large online following. Create unique, engaging, and consistent content, interact with your followers, and collaborate with other influencers to expand your reach. c. Reality television: Participating in reality TV shows can be a fast track to celebrity status. Choose a show that aligns with your personality and values, and be prepared to showcase an out-of-the-box aspect of your life, skills, or experiences. d. Sports: Excel in a sport, compete at regional, national, or international levels, and leverage your triumphs to gain public attention and endorsement deals. e. Entrepreneurship or business: Achieve outstanding success in the business world, either by founding a leading company or having a notable impact on an industry. This can lead to public recognition and sometimes even celebrity status. In conclusion, although the two questions relate to achieving fame, they focus on different aspects. The first question targets specifically becoming a successful artist, while the second question explores various avenues to achieve celebrity status in general."},{"question":"Write the answer: In the children’s television series ‘Four Feather Falls’, which British radio and television presenter provided the voice of Tex Tucker?","response":"To find the answer to this question, I will perform an online search to gather information about the children's television series 'Four Feather Falls' and identify the British radio and television presenter who provided the voice of Tex Tucker.

Based on the information provided in a given passage, you should identify the shortest continuous text span from the passage that serves as an answer to the given question. Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Input: Passage: The Famicom contained no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from \\"lock\\" to \\"key\\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating \\"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games stated \\"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\".

The Skookum cat was developed from intersections between Munchkins and LaPerms with the aim of creating a lurid cat with a short coat . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","response":"These two sentences, though they bear a resemblance, do not convey the same meaning. I will analyze them both for a more comprehensive understanding. In the first sentence: \\"The Skookum cat was developed from crosses between Munchkins and LaPerms with the aim of creating a short-legged cat with a curly coat.\\" Here, this sentence implies that the Skookum cat is a breed that was formed through crossbreeding between Munchkin and LaPerm cats. The primary objective was to produce a cat with short legs (from the Munchkin breed) and a curly coat (from the LaPerm breed). The sentence offers a clear and accurate description of what the breeders intended to achieve through this particular cross. In the second sentence: \\"The Skookum cat was developed from intersections between Munchkins and LaPerms with the aim of creating a lurid cat with a short coat.\\" This sentence still indicates that the Skookum cat is a result of crossbreeding between Munchkin and LaPerm cats. However, it states that the goal was to create a \\"lurid\\" cat. The term \\"lurid\\" can mean vivid in color, shocking, or sensational. Given the context, it is unclear what the author intends this term to convey, rendering it ambiguous. Moreover, the sentence mentions that the intended outcome was a short coat, which is not the objective of creating a Skookum cat. The intended goal, as seen in the first sentence, should be the creation of a cat with a curly coat. In summary, the first sentence clearly and accurately conveys the desired outcome of crossbreeding Munchkin and LaPerm cats to produce the Skookum cat breed. In contrast, the second sentence appears to provide an inaccurate description of the intended purpose, leading to confusion about the specific traits the breeders aimed to develop. Therefore, these two sentences, while similar, do not mean the same thing."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Article: While I was running slowly one morning, I saw my friend's father sitting alone on the roadside bench. So I crossed the road to wish him a good morning. As I came over to him, he was very happy to see me. He said it was nice of me to come and chat with him. Then he said to me in a low and sad voice: \\"At this stage of my life, it feels very lonely here. Anybody sharing a few heartfelt moments would mean a lot to me. \\" I was completely shocked by what he said, and I wondered: What could be that little thing that I can do to make his life different? I knew he was a painter, so I started to ask him about his latest painting experiences. Painting is a passionate topic for him, and he started to talk with me about it. I asked him, \\"Can you teach me to paint?\\" He was surprised at first and then agreed instantly. Now, every other day, I go to learn how to paint from him. We paint a lot and talk a lot. He says he feels better, and he waits for me. I say I feel better. After all, I am the one getting so much wisdom from a man who is nearing the horizon of his life with so much experience!

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure. It means that the President could commit capital treason, or any other federal crime, and then immediately pardon himself. \\"It means that he could commit murder in the White House,\\" Koppelman said. \\"It makes no sense within the Constitution as a whole.\\" Asked by reporters Monday about Trump’s comment on his ability to pardon himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly replied: \\"The...

She said the Scottish government would begin preparing legislation to enable another independence vote. Scotland voted in favour of the UK staying in the EU by 62% to 38%. The UK as a whole has voted to leave, by a margin of 52% to 48%, prompting UK Prime Minister David Cameron to announce he would stand down by October. The SNP manifesto for May's Holyrood elections said the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there was a \\"significant and material change\\" in the circumstances that prevailed at the time of the 2014 referendum, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. At a news conference in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said: \\"It is, therefore, a statement of the obvious that a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.\\" It looks \\"highly likely\\", says Nicola Sturgeon, that there will now be a second referendum upon Scottish independence. Is she enthused by this prospect? Does she thrill at the notion? Is she buffing up her best lines from 2014? The answers to those questions would be no, no and, once again, no. To be clear, for the avoidance of any doubt, Nicola Sturgeon remains rather keen on the concept of Scottish independence. Indeed, she yearns for it. She knows that means another referendum at some point in the future. But not now. Not in these circumstances. Not in these troubled times. Read more of Brian's blog Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish cabinet would meet on Saturday and she would make a statement to MSPs on Tuesday. The first minister said there was now a significant divergence between Scotland and the rest of Britain which she \\"deeply regretted\\". A majority of voters in all 32 council areas in Scotland voted Remain. Area-by-area in maps: See how people voted Speaking at her official residence, Bute House, she said: \\"I intend to take all possible steps and explore all possible options to give effect to how people in Scotland voted - in other words to secure our continuing place in the EU, and in the single market in particular.\\" Asked if there were any other options available to the Scottish government, she replied: \\"I think an independence referendum is now highly likely but I also think it is important that we take time to consider all steps and have the discussions, not least to assess the response of the European Union to the vote that Scotland expressed yesterday.\\" She also revealed she had spoken to London Mayor Sadiq Khan since the result and that he shared, for London, the desire to remain in the EU. \\"There is clear common cause between us,\\" she said. BBC Scotland took to the streets of towns and cities across the country to find out what people felt about the decision to leave the EU. Ms Sturgeon said: \\"After a campaign that has been characterised in the rest of the UK by fear and hate, my priority in the days, weeks and months ahead will be to act at all times in the best interests of Scotland and in a way that unites, not divides us. \\"Let me be clear about this. Whatever happens as a result of this outcome, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will always be Scotland's closest neighbours and our best friends - nothing will change that. \\"But I want to leave no-one in any doubt about this. I am proud of Scotland and how we voted yesterday. \\"We proved that we are a modern, outward looking and inclusive country and we said clearly that we do not want to leave the European Union. \\"I am determine to do what it takes to make sure these aspirations are realised.\\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she shared Ms Sturgeon's disappointment at the result - but she did not believe it justified holding another independence referendum. In a statement she said: \\"Like the first minister I want to see stability prioritised in the days ahead. Scotland will open for business next week in the same way as it closes today. \\"But I do not believe that a second independence referendum will help us achieve that stability nor that it is in the best interests of the people of Scotland.\\" Ms Davidson added that addressing the challenges of leaving the EU should not mean \\"leaving our own Union of nations\\". She said she believed in Scotland's place within the UK \\"today as much as ever.\\" Scottish Labour Leader Kezia Dugdale said the result was bad for jobs and the economy in Scotland and across the UK. She added that she would be ready to work with Ms Sturgeon in the \\"best interests of the people of Scotland\\". However, Ms Dugdale said she did not want to see a second Scottish independence referendum. She explained: \\"On the question of independence, many of the fundamental questions that were unresolved and unanswered in 2014, remain so. Not least the question of currency. What we don't need today is more turmoil, more upheaval and more economic chaos.\\" Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, said he would meet the Scottish government to ensure it was \\"fully involved\\" in negotiations surrounding the UK's withdrawal from the EU. Responding to suggestions that the result could trigger a second independence referendum, he said now was \\"a time for calmness and deliberation, not pushing other personal or political agendas\\". Scotland's only UKIP MEP David Coburn said it was \\"fantastic\\" that \\"we're out\\". He added: \\"Whatever nonsense Nicola is coming out with, all this nonsense of another referendum, another neverendum - she's talking through her hat - because 40% of the population don't want anything to do with the EU.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he was \\"angry that we have lost our place in Europe\\". He said: \\"It is bad for our country and the people who live here. It means cutting our ties with our biggest economic market despite the consequences for trade, business, jobs and incomes.\\" Scottish Green co-convenor Patrick Harvie said Scotland \\"must keep open every option for protecting ourselves from this threat\\".","response":"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that a second referendum for Scottish independence is \\"highly likely\\" as a result of the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union in the recent Brexit referendum. She argued that it was \\"democratically unacceptable\\" for Scotland to be taken out of the EU against its wish - as 62% of voters in Scotland voted in favour of remaining in the bloc. Consequently, the Scottish government will begin the process of preparing legislation that would enable another vote on independence. Sturgeon urged discussion and consideration of all options in assessing Scotland's continuing position within the European Union and the single market. Additionally, she emphasized Scotland's efforts to remain an integral part of the UK, despite the political turmoil experienced following the EU referendum."},{"question":"Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Brian Kerr, is a Scottish football player and manager who is currently in charge of Albion Rovers, Kerr represented Scotland at senior international level, earning three caps during the reign of who, as national team manager?

It's neutral because it's just describing wisdom as being rich and sudden. Sentiment analysis needs to have clear indicators of emotion or sentiment associated with it to evaluate it as positive or negative. In sentiment analysis, we primarily look for words or phrases that generally express happiness, joy, satisfaction, love, or excitement for positive sentiment. On the other hand, words or phrases that express sadness, anger, hate, dissatisfaction or frustration are perceived as indicators of negative sentiment. However, interpreting the sentiment of a sentence can also depend heavily on the context in which it is used. Without any background or additional information, it's challenging to give a definitive answer. \\"Rich and sudden wisdom\\" associates \\"wisdom\\" with being \\"rich\\" - normally perceived as a positive attribute. \\"Sudden\\" can be seen as either positive (if the wisdom is needed immediately or comes unexpectedly but is beneficial) or negative (if it's unexpected and overwhelming or leads to unforeseen ramifications). Because this sentence might take on different sentiments based on the situation, it really requires more context. For example, if the full sentence was, \\"They experienced a rich and sudden wisdom that saved them from making a huge mistake,\\" this would be perceived as having a positive sentiment. Conversely, \\"The rich and sudden wisdom was too overwhelming for them to handle\\" would have a negative sentiment. However, in the absence of context, we default to viewing the provided sentence as neutral. In conclusion, without any other information or context, \\"the rich and sudden wisdom\\" is taken as neutral because there are no certain indicators of emotion that would direct us to consider this sentence either positively or negatively."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Richard and Emmeline (now portrayed by Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields) begin to fall in love, although this is emotionally stressful for them because of their lack of education on human sexuality. Emmeline is frightened after she begins her first menstrual period; confused about it, she refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a cut. Sometime later, their relationship suffers a major blow when a ship appears for the first time in years. Richard's desire to leave comes into conflict with Emmeline's desire to stay, and she does not light the signal fire. As a result, the ship passes by without noticing them.

The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Japyx is a genus of diplurans belonging to the family Japygidae . These eyeless , predatory hexapods largely shun direct sunlight , remaining under stones and among detritus , where they use pincer - like cerci to catch their tiny prey . - Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found on all continents except Antarctica. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, \\"skin wings\\". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability. - The japygids (family Japygidae) are a taxon of hexapods, of the order Diplura. In this family, the paired cerci at the end of their abdomens are pincer-like (superficially similar to the unrelated earwigs) and are used to catch their tiny prey. Seventy genera are recognised, divided among seven subfamilies. - The order Diplura is one of the four groups of hexapods, alongside insects, springtails and Protura. They are sometimes called \\"two-pronged bristletails\\". Around 800 species have been described, of which around 70 occur in North America, 12 in Great Britain and two in Australia.

Initially an indie rock band, the band rose to prominence in the early-mid 2000s as part of the post-Britpop movement. The band were founded at the University of Dundee in 1993 by Lightbody, Michael Morrison, and Mark McClelland as Shrug. After briefly using the name Polarbear and released the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up. Snow Patrol said they would enter its \\"next phase\\" with their sixth album. The band took a new musical direction, and Connolly advised fans to keep an open mind regarding the new material. On 12 January 2011, Lightbody launched a blog to give details about the progress of the next release from the band. Snow Patrol released the single \\"Called Out in the Dark\\" (remixed by Fatboy Slim) for radio airplay on Thursday 21 July 2011 on BBC Radio 1 on Zane Lowe's radio show. According to official sources, the single itself would be released independently and as part of an EP later on and the UK release date was said to be 4 September. More details on the EP were announced on 3 August, when the group's website revealed the artwork and track list contents. Along with the new single, the release contained three new tracks entitled \\"My Brothers\\", \\"I'm Ready\\", and \\"Fallen Empires\\". In addition, it was revealed that the EP was intended to be a digital release limited to the UK and Ireland. Shortly after the premiere of the new lead single, the quintet's official website confirmed the news that the name of the new album would be Fallen Empires.

Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony, PlayStation 3 had an inauspicious start, and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes. The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation's most successful console in terms of units sold. Furthermore, PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start, and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series (regarding cross-platform games, Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006, although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed), and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\".

He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987. On May 1, 1972, the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York, to Burbank, California, because of the studio's proximity to the celebrities. Carson often joked about \\"beautiful downtown Burbank\\" and referred to \\"beautiful downtown Bakersfield\\", which prompted Bakersfield Mayor Mary K. Shell to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s. From July 1971, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern time zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific time zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central time zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed one hour later at 12:30 am local time. In 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes on September 16; Tom Snyder's Tomorrow added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the \\"permanent\\" guest host from September 1983 until 1986. The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic George Carlin. Jay Leno then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson--rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s. Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, Tonight remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about 4 million a year (15,008,000 today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles. He also declined director Martin Scorsese's offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film The King of Comedy, the role of a TV talk-show host then going to Jerry Lewis. In recognition of his 25th anniversary on The Tonight Show, Carson received a personal Peabody Award, the board saying he had \\"become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American.\\" They also said they \\"felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What shows did he work on?","response":"The text mentions that Johnny Carson's main work was on \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992)\\". Apart from this, no other shows are specifically mentioned in the provided text. It is stated that \\"Shows were videotaped in Burbank\\" and \\"The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts\\", but these references are still about The Tonight Show.

But others are wondering who the heck this girl is. If you even vaguely recognize her name, it’s probably from her biggest role to date, as Nancy, the brunette waitress and female lead in the recent “Nightmare on Elm Street” remake. Check out her acting chops in the preview above. And after the jump, all there is to know about Rooney, along with clips and interviews. First, the biographical deets. Mara is 24 and originally hails from Bedford, New York, a richie town in Westchester County. Her grandpops founded the New York Giants and her uncle co-owns the team. She is one of four children and is a bit of a humanitarian. After high school, she founded a charity for orphans in Kenya called Faces of Kiberia. In an interview with Paper magazine, she said, “I needed to get out of the bubble of Westchester. I wanted to finish high school and experience other parts of the world before I tried acting.” Rooney went on to college in NYU were she studied psychology and social policy. And than took off for L.A. three years ago to join her sister, Kate Mara, in the acting game. One of her first roles was in “Dare,” a flick starring Emmy Rossum and Zach Gilford. Here’s an interview she did about the movie. In “Dare,” Rooney played the popular girl, but she swears she was nothing like that in high school. “I was mostly just shy and had few friends,” she says. She also dishes that she prefers independent films to big studio productions. Oops! But something about her skittishness and monotone voice is kind of endearing, no? Last year, Rooney landed a role in Michael Cera’s “Youth in Revolt,” as a coed trying to sleep with 50 men. She also played a boarding school student carrying on an affair with an older man in “Tanner Hall.” See Rooney and hear more of her deadpan humor in the trailer below. And then, of course, came “Nightmare on Elm Street.” In the interview below, Rooney describes her character, a disturbed girl who actually seems a bit like Lisbeth. What do we think of the sweatshirt with one arm missing? Rooney has actually worked with David Fincher before. She has a bit part in “The Social Network,” his upcoming flick about Facebook. She plays the girl who broke Mark Zuckerberg’s heart. She doesn’t get much time in the preview, but she’s the wide-eyed brunette at 2:01. Interestingly, Rooney told Collider.com that she was nervous to work with Fincher the first time around because he’s known for being uber-demanding. “I was a little worried about [all the takes he does]. Am I going to feel stale? But it never felt like that. His notes are so specific and what he wants is so specific that every time we did it, it felt fresh and new and in the moment.” And she must have impressed him for him to then cast her as Lisbeth. A writer at Entertainment Weekly notes that Fincher drummed up press for the Lisbeth decision by “turning his whole casting process into a kind of role-of-the-century Cinderella event, a contemporary version of the search for Scarlett O’Hara.” They note that Rooney looks an awful lot like Scarlett O’Hara. Which, on second glance, she totally does. But do we think this movie will be big on a “Gone With The Wind” scale? [Daily Beast] [EW] ||||| Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic It has been decided. Rooney Mara just landed the role of a lifetime as Lisbeth Salander in the much-hyped American version of Stieg Larsson's novel The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She's set to star alongside Daniel Craig and Robin Wright in the cult favorite book-turned-flick. We think it should also be starring Kristen Stewart, but alas, we digress. So, the one question we've got now is...Who the hell is Rooney Mara?! 1. She's got famous relatives but humble beginnings: Mara, 25, attended New York University and studied psychology and social policy before pursuing a career in acting. Her great-grandfathers founded the New York Giants and the Pittsburgh Steelers, and her older sister, Kate Mara, is an actress with film credits including Iron Man 2, Brokeback Mountain and brief stints in 24, Entourage and Nip/Tuck. 2. You've seen her before...probably: After some bit parts in television shows like ER and Law & Order: SVU and a few small-time movies, Rooney recreated iconic heroine Nancy Holbrook in the 2010 reboot of A Nightmare on Elm Street. Critics were generally meh on the flick, but didn't completely discount Mara's performance as the gal who carried the film, which is arguably the closest role she's played to Lisbeth. 3. You'll see her again...real soon, this time: Mara has a leading role in The Social Network, you know, that movie about Facebook starring Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake. In the opening scene, she breaks up with her boyfriend, Mark Zuckerberg, who later goes on to found Facebook. The film involved some major Hollywood bigwigs behind the scenes, like Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher (who's directing Dragon Tattoo), so get ready to see Rooney stretch her acting chops before buying your ticket for Dragon. 4. She oversees her own charity: Mara is the chief overseer for Faces of Kibera, a charity she began to provide food, shelter and medical care for orphans in the Kenyan neighborhood of Kibera. At 21, she had already studied nonprofits in college and began the organization to build an orphanage in the province. Despite her blossoming acting career, she says she'll keep doing the Good Samaritan thing as well. 5. She beat out tons of A-listers to get this role: Let's face it: It seemed like every young actress in Tinseltown was vying for this role. Just a few of the high-profile names Rooney was in competiont against: Ellen Page, Carey Mulligan, Natalie Portman and Alice in Wonderland's Mia Wasikowska. Also on the short list for the part, and with a rather large constituency supporting her, was Twilight's Kristen Stewart. We were in the Kristen camp, but now that the part's officially gone to Mara, we'll bide our time and wait to see how she handles the role. Let's face it: Daniel Craig's no Robert Pattinson, after all. Follow @theawfultruth and @snarc on Twitter! _______ We've got all the casting gossip for you right here! ||||| UPDATE: Sony Pictures Entertainment has issued a press release on Mara. I’ve included it after Deadline’s story break. EXCLUSIVE: Ending one of the most drawn out and closely watched casting searches for an actress in years, Sony Pictures Entertainment and director David Fincher have chosen Rooney Mara to play Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, the film that begins shooting this fall in Sweden, with Daniel Craig starring. The film will be released December 21, 2011. Rooney was considered Fincher’s first choice in the process: the director had just helmed her in The Social Network. Closing a deal will amount to a formality, because Mara essentially agreed to terms when she and other young actresses signed on to tests that Fincher and producer Scott Rudin have conducted over the past several weeks. Her deal includes an option for two sequels that will cover The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest, the second and third books in the Millennium Trilogy by the late author Stieg Larsson. The books continue the same murder conspiracy storyline. Deadline revealed that Craig was signed a deal with two options weeks ago to play Mikael Blomkvist, the investigative journalist and part owner of the magazine Millennium, and Deadline also broke the story that Robin Wright was in talks to play Erika Berger, his occasional bed partner and the publisher of Millennium. Stellan Skarsgard was also reportedly in talks to play Martin Vanger, who joins the magazine’s board. The search for Salander has been the role that really captured the public fancy. Slight of frame and short, Salander is a brilliant but troubled computer hacker who helps Blomkvist unravel a decades-long murder mystery. The storyline is as dark as the subject matter that Fincher tackled in Seven, and subsequent books establish Salander as far more than Blomkvist’s sidekick (and occasional lover). While established actresses have been named as being in contention for the role — Natalie Portman (who tried to buy the books early on), Ellen Page (who filmed her own test), Carey Mulligan and most recently Scarlett Johansson — Fincher has focused his testing process on discovering an actress who fits Salander physically and in age proximity, which is early 20s. Mara was among a group of young actresses that included Alice In Wonderland star Mia Wasikowska, Sucker Punch’s Emily Browning (even though neither actress signed test deals), Fish Tank’s Katie Jarvis. Mara tested along with Sophie Lowe, Sarah Snook and French actress Lea Seydoux. Mara is a strong match: she is the right age and looks like Salander. She also had the advantage of working with Fincher and Rudin on The Social Network. The sister of Brokeback Mountain‘s Kate Mara and the great granddaughter of New York Giants football team founder Wellington Mara and Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney, Mara was most recently seen in the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street. Mara is repped by WME. (Culver City, August 16, 2010) — Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have been cast in the lead roles of Columbia Pictures’ three-picture adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s literary blockbuster The Millennium Trilogy under the direction of David Fincher. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo – the first film of the series, which also includes The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest – begins shooting next month in Sweden. The screenplay is written by Steve Zaillian and the film is being produced by Scott Rudin, Cean Chaffin, Ole Sondberg and Søren Stærmose. Mikael Wallen and Anni Fernandez are executive producers. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is set for worldwide release December 21, 2011. The Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson has been published in 44 countries and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide thus far. In the U.S. alone, the series has sold over 10 million copies, and the sales were recently calculated at the remarkable rate of one book per second. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo has broken sales records in virtually every country in which it has been published. It has sold over 5 million copies in the U.S. and has out-sold any other e-book in that rapidly expanding market. A literary phenomenon, all three books currently sit atop the New York Times Best Seller lists. In describing the scale of Larsson’s achievement, The Economist said: “Stieg Larsson’s vivid characters, the depth of the detail across the three books, the powerfully imaginative plot, and the sheer verve of the writing make the trilogy a masterpiece of its genre.” Michiko Kakutani, of The New York Times, described the Lisbeth character: “Lisbeth Salander, Stieg Larsson’s fierce pixie of a heroine, is one of the most original characters in a thriller to come along in a while – a gamin, Audrey Hepburn look-alike but with tattoos and piercings, the take-no-prisoners attitude of Lara Croft and the cool, unsentimental intellect of Mr. Spock. She is the vulnerable victim turned vigilante; a willfully antisocial girl . . . who has proved herself to be as incandescently proficient as any video game warrior.” The three novels have all become #1 worldwide bestsellers, an achievement unrivaled in trade book publishing. DAVID FINCHER most recently directed this fall’s much-anticipated The Social Network for Columbia Pictures, which opens in the U.S. on October 1st. DANIEL CRAIG recently starred in the two highest-grossing films in the James Bond franchise, Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale.

Featuring a star-studded cast that includes Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain, this 2014 blockbuster takes the audience on a breathtaking journey through time and space, leaving them awestruck by its visual and emotional impact. The story revolves around Earth facing an imminent apocalypse due to a global food shortage. Former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is called upon to lead an elite team of astronauts—Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly (David Gyasi), and Doyle (Wes Bentley)—on an interstellar mission to find a new planet capable of supporting human life. As humankind's last hope, they embark on a dangerous quest through wormholes and black holes in pursuit of a better future for their loved ones and the entire human race. Nolan's cinematic prowess shines through in \\"Interstellar,\\" as he masterfully combines breathtaking visuals with a deeply poignant plot. Every frame of this film is a work of art, from the realistic portrayal of outer space and undiscovered planets to the intricacies of the spacecraft and futuristic technologies. Fans of Nolan's earlier works, like \\"Inception\\" and \\"The Dark Knight,\\" will not be disappointed with the thought-provoking nature and thrilling suspense that have become hallmarks of his illustrious career. Unbeknownst to many, \\"Interstellar\\" features some of the most accurate depictions of scientific concepts in the realm of space travel and astrophysics. Nolan enlisted the help of renowned theoretical physicist Kip Thorne as an executive producer and scientific advisor to ensure that even the most complex notions—such as time dilation and the gravitational effects of black holes—are grounded in reality. As a result, \\"Interstellar\\" transcends the realms of pure science-fiction and offers viewers a profound sense of awe and wonder about the mysteries of the cosmos. Though far from being a simple space-adventure flick, \\"Interstellar\\" also delves into the emotional depths of human relationships, which is where the film truly shines. McConaughey's portrayal of Cooper—one of the most touching in his career—captures the anguished sacrifice of leaving his family to save the entirety of the human race. Likewise, Anne Hathaway impresses with her passionate and determined character, Amelia Brand. The supporting cast, led by Michael Caine and Jessica Chastain, adds depth and richness to the plot through their powerful on-screen performances. Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score, infused with an orchestral blend of traditional and electronic elements, provides the perfect backdrop for the movie's most intense and emotional scenes. Zimmer's profound understanding of the themes permeating \\"Interstellar\\" enhances the overall experience and leaves viewers with the echoes of his melodies long after the credits have rolled. In conclusion, \\"Interstellar\\" is a tour de force that highlights Christopher Nolan's gift for storytelling, the magic of visual effects, and the very essence of humanity. It leaves audiences with questions about the future, the sacrifices we might have to make, and the possibility of a greater existence out there beyond the stars. If you haven't watched it yet, now is the time to embark on this jaw-dropping journey that will carry you to the edges of space and the expanses of the human heart."},{"question":"Given the question: To celebrate the end of our exams, my friends and I went to a fast food restaurant. We ordered hamburgers and Coca Cola at the counter. When our food came, I started walking towards an empty table. By bad luck, my purse strap got caught on a chair and the tray that I was holding slipped from my hands and went flying in the air. The tray, and its contents, fell on a man who was just about to take a bite of his sandwich. I stared, greatly shocked , as the drinks soaked his white shirt. Then I closed my eyes and prepared myself for his burst of anger. Instead, he said \\"It's OK\\" to comfort me before he disappeared into the washroom. Still shaky and unsure what to do next, my friends and I went to a table and sat there, trying our best to look calm. A moment later, the man came out of the washroom and approached our table. My heart almost stopped beating. I thought he was going to ask for my father' s number and call him.

Article: Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out.

Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941) was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. He was the eldest grandchild of the Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and related to many monarchs and princes of Europe, most notably King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Acceding to the throne in 1888, he dismissed the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890. He also launched Germany on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" in foreign affairs that culminated in his support for Austria-Hungary in the crisis of July 1914 that led in a matter of days to the First World War. German foreign policy under Wilhelm II was faced with a number of significant problems. Perhaps the most apparent was that Wilhelm was an impatient man, subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse. He was personally ill-equipped to steer German foreign policy along a rational course. It is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which Wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the German foreign policy elite. There were a number of notorious examples, such as the Kruger telegram of 1896 in which Wilhelm congratulated President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal Republic on the suppression of the British Jameson Raid, thus alienating British public opinion. British public opinion had been quite favourable toward the Kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne, but it turned sour in the late 1890s. During the First World War, he became the central target of British anti-German propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy. Wilhelm invented and spread fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other European rulers in the perils they faced by invading China; few other leaders paid attention. Wilhelm used the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War to try to incite fear in the west of the yellow peril that they faced by a resurgent Japan, which Wilhelm claimed would ally with China to overrun the west. Under Wilhelm, Germany invested in strengthening its colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but few became profitable and all were lost during the First World War. In South West Africa (now Namibia), a native revolt against German rule led to the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, although Wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped. One of the few times when Wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in 1900 he supported the marriage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria to Sophie Chotek, against the wishes of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. A domestic triumph for Wilhelm was when his daughter Victoria Louise married the Duke of Brunswick in 1913; this helped heal the rift between the House of Hanover and the House of Hohenzollern which followed the annexation of Hanover by Prussia in 1866.","response":"This text is about Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern), the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia."},{"question":"Complete text: kellan 's voice was perfect and powerful ; it made a shiver run down my spine . he really was so good at this , so inspiring to watch . as he played , words and storylines filtered through my head . even though i hated to turn away from kellan , i decided to not let this creative spark get away from me . as quickly as i could , i dashed away to find some","response":"Step 1: Understand the task I need to complete the text provided, which describes a situation where the protagonist is impressed by Kellan's powerful voice and gets inspired to act on their creative spark.

Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author?

Let's dissect it to elaborate more contextually and comprehensively. Starting from \\"@nessie_111 I would go with sea as well\\", this part demonstrates that the sender is directly addressing a specific user (@nessie_111) and proposing their opinion, i.e., they agree with a previous statement or question (presumably about preferring 'sea,' though the original context isn't provided). The sentiment here is affirming and positive as it conveys agreement or alignment with the other user's viewpoint. It subtly reflects shared interests, ideologies, or beliefs, reinforcing bonding and rapport. The second part of the tweet, \\"- is that cheating to chip in once the answer is there\\", manifests a light-hearted and jovial undertone. The phrase \\"is that cheating\\" forms a rhetorical question, suggesting a level of humor. The sender jokingly implies that they might be 'cheating' by agreeing or 'chipping in' with their thoughts after an answer (or consensus) might already exist. Thus, this part adds a playful element to the tweet, making it friendly and casual. The phrasing and tone do not seem to express any negative, aggressive, or confrontational sentiments. Instead, it fosters interpersonal communication and strengthens online community bonds. Using seemingly informal and cheeky questions or remarks is a common practice on social media platforms, allowing sending subtle cues about playfulness, agreeabiity and camaraderie. Integrating this analysis, we conclude that the overall sentiment of this tweet is significantly positive, congenial, community-driven, and slightly humorous."},{"question":"Question: what do living things do to continue the species? Options: - move - love - procreate - increase in size - increase population Explain why a human would choose \\"procreate\\" to answer the question above:","response":"Human beings would choose \\"procreate\\" as the answer to the question \\"what do living things do to continue the species?\\" among the options provided because it directly relates to the reproduction and continuation of life for a species. The other options, although connected to the general growth and development of living organisms, do not specifically address the continuation of a species. Let's examine each option more closely: 1) Move: Movement helps living organisms interact with their environment, find food, escape predators, and search for suitable locations to live and breed. While movement can contribute to an organism's success and survival, it doesn't directly ensure the continuation of the species through reproduction. 2) Love: Love, in the context of living things, can refer to emotions or social bonding between humans and animals. Although love influences relationships, attachment, and care, it doesn't directly contribute to the continuation of a species. Love can shape how individuals of a species treat and support each other, but it is not necessary for species survival compared to procreation. 3) Procreate: Procreation is the process through which living organisms reproduce sexually, or asexually in some cases, creating offspring that carry their genetic material. This directly ensures the continuation of a species, as it enables the transfer of genetic information from one generation to the next, allowing the species to adapt and survive in their environment. Procreation is the most critical aspect of species survival, which is why humans would choose this answer. 4) Increase in size: The increase in size of organisms can refer to growth and development during an individual's lifespan, making them stronger and more capable of surviving, finding resources, and warding off predators. While an increase in size can positively influence an individual organism's chances of survival and reproduction, it doesn't directly contribute to the continuation of the species, as it is not concerned with reproduction. 5) Increase population: An increase in population numbers can indicate that a species is effectively surviving and adapting to its environment, but it is the consequence of procreation rather than the cause. An increased population results from successful procreation and offspring survival, making it an indirect factor in the continuation of a species rather than a direct cause. In conclusion, humans would choose \\"procreate\\" as the answer to the question because it is the process through which a species continues to exist by producing offspring that inherit their genetic material. This reproduction process is essential for species continuation and adaptation. Though the other options are relevant to the well-being and survival of a species, they do not specifically address the core aspect of species continuation through reproduction."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence which contains a motion and your task is to identify the physical entities involved in the motion.

To do this, let's revisit the important points extracted from the premise: 1. There is a group of people. 2. These people are dancing. 3. The dancing is taking place in a room. As noted in point 1, we know that there is a group of people, and point 3 states they are dancing in a room. This contrasts with the hypothesis, which asserts that the room is empty. The presence of people in the room, as stated in the premise, contradicts the assertion that the room is empty. Step 4: Evaluating the entailment. Based on the comparison made in step 3, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise states that there is a group of people dancing in the room, while the hypothesis claims that the room is empty. These two statements are inconsistent with each other. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily true given the premise. In summary, the hypothesis \\"The room is empty\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"A group of people enjoying dancing in a room,\\" as the presence of people in the room contradicts the hypothesis."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Eduard Schwyzer ( 15 February 1874 , Zürich -- 3 May 1943 , Berlin ) was a Swiss Classical philologist and Indo - European linguist , specializing in Ancient Greek and Greek dialects . He was a professor in Zürich 1912 -- 1926 , in Bonn from 1927 and in Berlin from 1932 . - The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. - Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language, on the Greek mainland, Crete and Cyprus in Mycenaean Greece (16th to 12th centuries BCE), before the hypothesised Dorian invasion, often cited as the \\"terminus post quem\\" for the coming of the Greek language to Greece. The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B, a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century. Most inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos, in central Crete, as well as in Pylos, in the southwest of the Peloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania, in Western Crete. The language is named after Mycenae, one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - The Havel is a river in north-eastern Germany, flowing through the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

Two candidates were registered; Lerdo de Tejada and General Porfirio Díaz, one of the heroes of the Battle of Puebla which had taken place on May 5, 1862. Lerdeo de Tejada won the election, but lost popularity after he announced his intent to run for re-election. On March 21, 1876, Don Porfirio Díaz rebelled against President Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. The Plan of Tuxtepec defended the \\"No Re-election\\" principle. On June 2, 1876 the garrisons in the state of Chihuahua surrendered to the authority of General Porfirio Díaz; Governor Antonio Ochoa was arrested until all the Lerdista forces were suppressed throughout the state. Porfirio Díaz then helped Tíras regain the governorship of the state of Chihuahua allowing for the Plan of Tuxtepec to be implemented. The victory of the Plan of Tuxtepec, gave the interim presidency to Jose Maria Iglesias and later, as the only candidate, the General Porfirio Díaz assumed the presidency on May 5, 1877. During the first years of the Porfiriato (Porfirio Díaz Era), the Díaz administration had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache. A new rebellion led by the Lerdista party was orchestrated from exile in the United States. The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of El Paso del Norte until mid-1877. During 1877 the northern parts of the state suffered through a spell of extreme drought which were responsible for many deaths in El Paso del Norte. Please answer a question about this article.

She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again.

She is the same age as Alan Kurdi, the Syrian boy whose body washed up last week on a Turkish beach. Soon she will take her place in an overcrowded smuggler's dinghy just as he did. Her doting father, Mounib Zakiya, plans to take his children and grandchildren from the Jordanian capital to the Turkish coast, to be smuggled into Europe. He says he is leaving Amman, after three years, for one reason - his meagre aid has been cut off. \\"It's safe here,\\" said the former estate agent, \\"and life is good. But we have to buy food and milk for the children. We have to pay for medical care. How can I pay the rent?\\" His family of nine was living on about 1 (Â£0.65) a day per person. Now even that has gone. He says the United Nations and the international community are forcing him to risk all on the open seas. \\"They bear 75% of the responsibility,\\" he said, cradling Rana on his lap. \\"They have opened a gate to death, and are making us walk through it. \\"It's better to die fast on the journey, than die slowly, watching your kids starve.\\" Mr Zakiya is one of many Syrian refugees in Jordan who have lost their lifeline. For months the World Food Programme (WFP) has been cutting aid to the bone due to a lack of donations. It reduced the monthly stipend for about 211,000 Syrians by half. At the beginning of September it went further. Almost 230,000 Syrian refugees - living in cities, not camps - had their aid stopped entirely. Help is still being provided for 100,000 living in camps, but there, too, funds could run out in November. Aid workers say that if refugees cannot get help where they are, they will risk their lives to find it elsewhere. \\"If people were receiving enough assistance and were able to have a somewhat stable life where they are, they would not make that decision,\\" said the WFP's Dina El-Kassaby. \\"But unfortunately, some people are pushed to the edge.\\" Adnan Ghanoum is one of them. The former factory owner from Damascus, aged 61, is weighed down with worries about his extended family. He has 19 relatives living with him in Amman, including a disabled daughter. Mr Ghanoum says he almost had a heart attack when he read the SMS saying his aid was ending. \\"We have no future here in Jordan,\\" he said. \\"There is no education, no work, and no money. We have been eating flour and onions for a week.\\" He is now thinking of returning to the war zone from which he fled. \\"It's better to go back to Syria to die there,\\" he said, \\"and rest in peace.\\" If he goes back home, he will not be the only one. Aid agencies say the numbers returning to Syria have doubled since the cuts began. And the flow of refugees from Jordan to Europe is expected to increase substantially. Western governments are partly to blame because they did not provide enough support in the region, according to one senior aid worker. He says it would have \\"made sense\\" for Europe to invest here but there was \\"penny-pinching and ineptitude\\". Mounib Zakiya says he and his family would stay in Jordan, if their aid was restored. But he has already packed blankets and winter clothing for their journey to Europe. He knows they could perish on the way - just like his old neighbours from Syria who drowned two weeks ago. The family of five slipped beneath the waves as they tried to cross the Aegean Sea. \\"If we die, I hope it will be on the TV and everyone will see it,\\" he said sombrely. \\"Then maybe they will find a solution for Syria.\\" Summary:","response":"Syrian refugee families in Jordan, like Mounib Zakiya's, are struggling to survive after aid from the World Food Programme has been cut due to insufficient donations.

Aid workers warn that if refugees cannot find help where they are, they will risk their lives to find it elsewhere.

Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.

Here’s what’s behind the unbelievable numbers. It was a balmy afternoon last July when the call came in: Dead body found inside empty warehouse on the West Side. Chicago police officers drove through an industrial stretch of the hardscrabble Austin neighborhood and pulled up to the 4600 block of West Arthington Street. The warehouse in question was an unremarkable-looking red-brick single-story building with a tall barbed-wire fence. Vacant for six years, it had been visited that day by its owner and a real-estate agent—the person who had called 911. Also In This Special Report The Truth About Chicago’s Crime Rates: Part 2 One Year Later, CPD’s New Tricks: Part 3 Editor’s Note: On Accuracy The place lacked electricity, so crime scene technicians set up generators and portable lights. The power flickered on to reveal a grisly sight. In a small office, on soggy carpeting covered in broken ceiling tiles, lay a naked, lifeless woman. She had long red-streaked black hair and purple glitter nail polish on her left toenails (her right ones were gone), but beyond that it was hard to discern much. Her face and body were bloated and badly decomposed, her hands ash colored. Maggots feasted on her flesh. At the woman’s feet, detectives found a curled strand of telephone wire. Draped over her right hand was a different kind of wire: thin and brown. The same brown wire was wrapped around each armrest of a wooden chair next to her. The following day, July 24, a pathologist in the Cook County medical examiner’s office noticed something else that had been obscured by rotting skin: a thin gag tied around the corpse’s mouth. Advertisement Thanks to some still-visible tattoos, detectives soon identified this unfortunate woman: Tiara Groves, a 20-year-old from Austin. She was last seen walking alone in the wee hours of Sunday, July 14, near a liquor store two miles from the warehouse. At least eight witnesses who saw her that night told police a similar story: She appeared drunk and was upset—one man said that she was crying so hard she couldn’t catch her breath—but refused offers of help. A man who talked to her outside the liquor store said that Groves warned him, excitedly and incoherently, that he should stay away from her or else somebody (she didn’t say who) would kill him too. Toxicology tests showed she had heroin and alcohol in her system, but not enough to kill her. All signs pointed to foul play. According to the young woman’s mother, who had filed a missing-person report, the police had no doubt. “When this detective came to my house, he said, ‘We found your daughter. . . . Your daughter has been murdered,’ ” Alice Groves recalls. “He told me they’re going to get the one that did it.” On October 28, a pathologist ruled the death of Tiara Groves a homicide by “unspecified means.” This rare ruling means yes, somebody had killed Groves, but the pathologist couldn’t pinpoint the exact cause of death. Given the finding of homicide—and the corroborating evidence at the crime scene—the Chicago Police Department should have counted Groves’s death as a murder. And it did. Until December 18. On that day, the police report indicates, a lieutenant overseeing the Groves case reclassified the homicide investigation as a noncriminal death investigation. In his writeup, he cited the medical examiner’s “inability to determine a cause of death.” That lieutenant was Denis Walsh—the same cop who had played a crucial role in the alleged cover-up in the 2004 killing of David Koschman, the 21-year-old who died after being punched by a nephew of former mayor Richard M. Daley. Walsh allegedly took the Koschman file home. For years, police officials said that it was lost. After the Sun-Times reported it missing, the file mysteriously reappeared. But back to Tiara Groves. With the stroke of a computer key, she was airbrushed out of Chicago’s homicide statistics. The change stunned officers. Current and former veteran detectives who reviewed the Groves case at Chicago’s request were just as incredulous. Says a retired high-level detective, “How can you be tied to a chair and gagged, with no clothes on, and that’s a [noncriminal] death investigation?” (He, like most of the nearly 40 police sources interviewed for this story, declined to be identified by name, citing fears of disciplinary action or other retribution.) Was it just a coincidence, some wondered, that the reclassification occurred less than two weeks before the end of the year, when the city of Chicago’s final homicide numbers for 2013 would be tallied? “They essentially wiped away one of the murders in the city, which is crazy,” says a police insider. “But that’s the kind of shit that’s going on.” For the case of Tiara Groves is not an isolated one. Chicago conducted a 12-month examination of the Chicago Police Department’s crime statistics going back several years, poring through public and internal police records and interviewing crime victims, criminologists, and police sources of various ranks. We identified 10 people, including Groves, who were beaten, burned, suffocated, or shot to death in 2013 and whose cases were reclassified as death investigations, downgraded to more minor crimes, or even closed as noncriminal incidents—all for illogical or, at best, unclear reasons. Advertisement This troubling practice goes far beyond murders, documents and interviews reveal. Chicago found dozens of other crimes, including serious felonies such as robberies, burglaries, and assaults, that were misclassified, downgraded to wrist-slap offenses, or made to vanish altogether. (We’ll examine those next month in part 2 of this special report.) Many officers of different ranks and from different parts of the city recounted instances in which they were asked or pressured by their superiors to reclassify their incident reports or in which their reports were changed by some invisible hand. One detective refers to the “magic ink”: the power to make a case disappear. Says another: “The rank and file don’t agree with what’s going on. The powers that be are making the changes.” Granted, a few dozen crimes constitute a tiny percentage of the more than 300,000 reported in Chicago last year. But sources describe a practice that has become widespread at the same time that top police brass have become fixated on demonstrating improvement in Chicago’s woeful crime statistics. And has there ever been improvement. Aside from homicides, which soared in 2012, the drop in crime since Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy arrived in May 2011 is unprecedented—and, some of his detractors say, unbelievable. Crime hasn’t just fallen, it has freefallen: across the city and across all major categories. Take “index crimes”: the eight violent and property crimes that virtually all U.S. cities supply to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its Uniform Crime Report. According to police figures, the number of these crimes plunged by 56 percent citywide from 2010 to 2013—an average of nearly 19 percent per year—a reduction that borders on the miraculous. To put these numbers in perspective: From 1993, when index crimes peaked, to 2010, the last full year under McCarthy’s predecessor, Jody Weis, the average annual decline was less than 4 percent. This dramatic crime reduction has been happening even as the department has been bleeding officers. (A recent Tribune analysis listed 7,078 beat cops on the streets, 10 percent fewer than in 2011.) Given these facts, the crime reduction “makes no sense,” says one veteran sergeant. “And it makes absolutely no sense that people believe it. Yet people believe it.” The city’s inspector general, Joseph Ferguson, may not. Chicago has learned that his office has questioned the accuracy of the police department’s crime statistics. A spokeswoman confirmed that the office recently finalized an audit of the police department’s 2012 crime data—though only for assault-related crimes so far—“to determine if CPD accurately classified [these categories of] crimes under its written guidelines and if it reported related crime statistics correctly.” (The audit found, among other things, that the department undercounted aggravated assaults and batteries by more than 24 percent, based on the sample cases reviewed.) Meanwhile, the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil pols on Chicago’s City Council have mostly accepted the police department’s crime numbers at face value. So have most in the media. You can hardly turn on the news without hearing McCarthy or Mayor Rahm Emanuel proclaiming unquestioned: Murders down 18 percent in 2013! Overall crime down 23 percent! Twelve thousand fewer crime victims! “These days, everything is about media and public opinion,” says one longtime officer. “If a number makes people feel safe, then why not give it to them?” If you want proof of the police department’s obsession with crime statistics, look no further than the last few days of 2012. On the night of December 27, a 40-year-old alleged gang member named Nathaniel Jackson was shot in the head and killed in Austin. The next morning, newscasters proclaimed that Chicago’s murder toll for the year had hit 500—a grim milestone last reached in 2008, during the Great Recession. By lunchtime, the police department’s spinmeisters at 35th and Michigan had challenged the reports. The actual total, they said, was 499. A murder case earlier in the year had just been reclassified as a death investigation. Critics howled. The bloggers behind Second City Cop declared: “It’s a miracle! The dead have risen!!!” By late afternoon, police had backed down; Jackson was, indeed, the 500th homicide of 2012. Chicago would end the year with 507 recorded murders, more than in any other city in the nation. Many inside the police force, as well as many outside criminologists, saw the spike in violence in 2012 as a statistical anomaly. Crime tends to go in cycles, they pointed out; the city topped 500 killings not only in 2008 but also in 2003, 2002, and 2001, to name a few. Still, it looked bad for Mayor Emanuel. His disapproval rating in the polls was rising sharply, particularly among black voters. Behind closed doors, according to a City Hall insider, Emanuel told his police chief that the department had better not allow a repeat performance of 2012 or McCarthy’s days in Chicago would be numbered. (Through a spokeswoman, the mayor declined to comment for this article.) McCarthy called 2012’s homicide total a “tragic number” and vowed that things would be different in 2013. The mindset inside police headquarters, recalls one officer: “Whatever you gotta do, this can’t happen again.” The chief felt even more pressure than his rank and file may have realized. For the former New Yorker to prove that his policing strategies worked in Chicago, he would need to keep the number of murders not just below 2012’s total but also below 2011’s: 435. To do so, McCarthy leaned even more heavily on a tool that has proved wildly successful in his hometown: CompStat. Borrowing performance-management principles from the business world, CompStat collects, analyzes, and maps a city’s crime data in real time. These statistics help police track trouble spots more accurately and pinpoint where officers are needed most. The department’s number crunchers can slice and dice the stats all sorts of ways, spitting out reports showing percentage changes in various crimes by neighborhood over different time frames, for example: month to month, week to week—heck, hour to hour. Armed with those statistics, the police brass turn up the pressure in weekly meetings, grilling field commanders about crime in their areas. The statistics are widely said to make or break a career. “The only evaluation is the numbers,” says a veteran sergeant. “God forbid your crime is up. If you have a 20 percent reduction this month, you’d better have a 21 percent reduction the next month.” The homicide numbers are especially important, says one cop: “You should see these supervisors, like cats in a room filled with rocking chairs, afraid to classify a murder because of all the screaming they will hear downtown.” If the numbers are bad, the district commanders and officers get reamed out by McCarthy and the other bosses at headquarters. These targets frequently leave the meetings seething. Even McCarthy concedes that such meetings can get ugly. “When I was a commander in New York, it was full contact,” he told Chicago in 2012. “And if you weren’t careful, you could lose an eye.” Unfortunately for all concerned, January 2013 could not have started out worse. Five people were murdered in Chicago on New Year’s Day. The number hit 17 by the end of the first full week. “This is too much,” Al Wysinger, the police department’s first deputy superintendent, told the crowd in the January 17 CompStat meeting, according to a memo summarizing it. “Last October and November, I kept saying we have to start 2013 off on the right foot. Wrong foot! We can’t reiterate this much clearer.” As the month wore on, the death toll kept rising. Among the victims were headline grabbers Ronnie Chambers, 33, the last of his mother’s four children to die from gun violence, and Hadiya Pendleton, 15, the honor student who was shot in a park about a mile from President Obama’s house. And then there was 20-something Tiffany Jones from the South Side. (To protect the identity of her family, we have given her a pseudonym.) In January, Jones got into an argument with a male relative that turned into a “serious physical fight,” according to the police report. Her sister later told police that she saw the enraged man punch Jones in the head. Police and paramedics arrived to find Jones’s siblings struggling to keep him out of the family’s apartment. Inside, Jones was sitting on the couch, gasping for breath. When officers asked her if she wanted to press battery charges, she could only nod yes, the police report shows. She tried to stand but collapsed to the floor, no longer breathing. Rushed to the hospital, Jones was soon pronounced dead. The attending doctor noted head trauma and bleeding behind Jones’s left eye. Seeing fresh bruises on her left cheek, left eye, and both arms, the investigating officers were leaning toward recommending a first-degree murder charge against the male relative, according to the police report. First-degree murder—willfully killing or committing an act that creates a “strong probability of death or great bodily harm”—carries more severe penalties than any other homicide charge. The next day, however, a pathologist with the Cook County medical examiner’s office came to the surprising conclusion that Jones had died from a blood clot that was unrelated to the fight. “Because of the embolism,” the pathologist noted to detectives, according to the police report, Jones “would have died ‘from just walking down the street.’ ” Disagreements between police and medical examiners are rare but not unheard of. When they do occur, the rule for police is clear. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook expressly states that a police department’s classification of a homicide should be based solely on a police investigation, not on the determination of a medical examiner or prosecutor’s office. But the officers did not ask for a lesser homicide charge, such as involuntary manslaughter, against Jones’s relative. Nor did they even charge him with battery. The reason, the report states: “the lack of any complaining victim or witness to the domestic battery incident.” Never mind that a dead victim cannot complain. Advertisement Police sent the man on his way. And that was that. Search for this case in the police department’s public database of 2013 crimes and you won’t find it. It’s as if it never happened. By the end of January, 44 people had been murdered in Chicago, more than in any first month since 2002. That big number—and the national attention brought by Pendleton’s killing—set off more public furor about the inability of McCarthy and Emanuel to stem the bloodshed. A spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police said that their strategies had “failed miserably.” Even aldermen who had heaped praise on McCarthy in the past started to criticize. “If this isn’t dealt with soon,” warned the 21st Ward alderman Howard Brookins, chairman of the City Council’s black caucus, “the mayor is gonna be forced to do something about McCarthy, or this could potentially become his snow issue.” It was a reference to Mayor Michael Bilandic’s mishandling of the Blizzard of ’79, one of the most infamous career killers in Chicago political history. After January 2013, the number of homicides in Chicago began falling dramatically. February ended with just 14. March ended with 17. That compares with 29 and 52, respectively, in 2012. Emanuel and McCarthy were giddy. The policing changes they had made in the past three months had worked! Those changes included, a day after Pendleton’s death, moving 200 officers from desks to the streets and bringing back the roving units Emanuel and McCarthy had disbanded when they first took over. What’s more, in February, McCarthy started sending officers into 20 “impact zones” deemed the most dangerous in the city. In March, some 400 cops began patrolling these zones daily, racking up about 1 million in overtime per week. McCarthy was frustrated that the media was giving most of the credit for the murder reduction to the cold weather rather than to his policing strategies. The city called a news conference. “We are clearly having an impact on the homicides,” Emanuel told reporters on April 1. He declared that the number of murders in the first quarter of 2013 was lower than in any other first quarter in the past 50 years. The mayor didn’t mention that the department’s own records show that Chicago had the exact same number of homicides in the first three months of 2009 as it did in the first three months of 2013. Nor did he remind his audience that Chicago’s population has shrunk by nearly 1 million people since 1960. Look at murder rates—homicides per 100,000 people—and you get 15 today. That rate is one-third higher than in 1960. And it’s nearly four times New York City’s current rate. April Fool’s Day marked the unofficial start of a new city tactic: inundate the public with crime-decline statistics, carefully choosing time periods that demonstrated the biggest possible drops from the same period in 2012 or beyond, whatever sounded best. “Between the time of 8:36 am 32 seconds and 8:39 am 15 seconds . . . crime went down an amazing 89%!!! compared to the same time last year,” one wag posted on Second City Cop. Turns out the low March homicide numbers were made possible in part by curious categorizations of two more deaths. One is the case of Maurice Harris. On March 15, the 57-year-old Harris—an older man playing a young man’s game—teamed up with a crew selling heroin near the corner of Cicero and Van Buren on the West Side. It was a sliver of turf that belonged to a street gang, the Undertaker Vice Lords. Midmorning, Harris saw about five men walking up the block. His crew scattered. Harris got a tap on the shoulder, then a punch in the face, according to the police report. Moments later, he was on the sidewalk, taking repeated punches and kicks and blows to the head with a metal pipe. When the beatdown finally ended, Harris told a witness that he couldn’t feel his legs. He was rushed to Loretto Hospital, then transferred to two other hospitals—Mount Sinai and Rush—as his condition worsened. On March 19, Harris began slurring his words, and his arms went numb. Doctors put in a breathing tube; they also diagnosed a spinal cord injury. On March 21, six days after the beating, Harris died. Police recorded the Maurice Harris case as a battery, which is indisputably true. But not as a homicide. At first, the Cook County medical examiner’s office said that an autopsy was inconclusive. The pathologist, according to the police report, “deferred the cause and manner of death pending further studies.” Eight months later, on November 13, the same pathologist made a final ruling—a head scratcher to every police source we spoke to who reviewed the case. Harris, the doctor determined, died from a pulmonary embolism, diabetes, and drug abuse. The police report summarized the pathologist’s findings: “The victim showed no significant evidence of injuries sustained from the battery [and] that in no way did it appear that the battery contributed to the cause of his death and therefore ruled his death as natural.” That’s all detectives needed to close their death investigation. But they still had to wrap up the battery case. They declared it solved, reporting that they knew what had happened, knew who beat up Harris, and had enough evidence to “support an arrest, charge, and [turn] over to the court for prosecution.” But because the victim was dead and “there is no complaining witness to aid in the prosecution,” there was no reason to move forward. Harris’s attackers were therefore never apprehended. On March 28, three weeks after Chicago filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the Cook County medical examiner’s office about the case of Maurice Harris, the office changed its death ruling from “natural” to “undetermined.” The ruling cited new information from medical records that, a spokesman for the medical examiner says, the office had requested “some time ago” but had only just received. The current chief medical examiner, Stephen Cina, was appointed by Cook County board president Toni Preckwinkle in July 2012. That was shortly after previous examiner Nancy Jones retired following an avalanche of negative publicity about bodies stacking up at the city morgue. It was also a few months after Preckwinkle and the county’s board of commissioners had passed ordinances giving themselves more power over the office—for example, imposing a five-year term limit and making it easier to fire the medical examiner by a simple majority vote. Previously, the medical examiner’s tenure could last a lifetime: a Supreme Court–like term meant to insulate the position from the political and police pressures so notorious in “Crook County.” As the former deputy medical examiner of Broward County in famously corrupt South Florida, Cina was plenty used to politics. “If I get an inordinate amount of pressure, I don’t intend to buckle or break under it,” he vowed to the Sun-Times. Cina says he has made numerous changes to the office to bring it more in line with national standards. “We’ve rewritten every standard operating procedure in the place,” he says. He also says that he has “tweaked” how his office assigns the cause and manner of a death. For example, he added the ruling “homicide by unspecified means”—the ruling that police used to shut down the Tiara Groves homicide investigation. “Some people may not be familiar with the term, but it’s an acceptable cause of death,” Cina insists. Might changes under Cina help explain the perplexing findings in other 2013 cases, such as those of Maurice Harris and Tiffany Jones? There is no evidence that the medical examiner’s office intentionally issued misleading or inaccurate rulings to help the city keep its homicide count down. “I’ve never felt pressure one way or another to make my ruling,” Cina says. “I’m pro–scientific truth more than anything.” But knowledgeable sources who reviewed these cases for Chicago say that the way the medical examiner’s rulings were worded gave police the wiggle room they needed to avoid “taking a hit” on the statistics, as one detective put it. Says a source who used to work at the medical examiner’s office: “I can see the powers that be in the police department saying, ‘Here’s our out.’ ” On March 17, two days after Maurice Harris got pummeled, police were called to the top floor of a red-brick three-flat in Pilsen. A man who had just returned home from a trip smelled a “foul odor” coming from a plastic air mattress in the bedroom of a roommate he hadn’t seen in weeks. When he started pulling debris from the mattress, he saw a grotesquely decomposed human head. The rest of the body was cocooned in garbage. Investigators opened the bag to find that the corpse was a woman’s, wrapped in a blood-soaked blanket. She was wearing turquoise jogging pants, a black camisole, a hoodie, and boots. Police identified her as Michelle Manalansan, 29, a student at Harold Washington College. She had last been seen at her downtown apartment on February 9. The police report adds that investigators were told by witnesses that the absent roommate “was the last person seen with [Michelle].” Advertisement The roommate, police learned, was wanted by the Cook County sheriff for a probation violation. They also learned that a relative had bought him a ticket to Los Angeles on a train that left Chicago six days after Manalansan disappeared. Despite the circumstances, police classified the case as a noncriminal death investigation. A detective soon made it an even lower priority: He suspended the case until the roommate could be “located and interviewed.” Manalansan’s death certificate on file with the Cook County clerk’s office says that she died by homicide—specifically, blunt head and neck trauma. But at presstime, her case had still not been classified as criminal. The roommate was still at large. With a hint of disgust, one retired veteran detective who reviewed the cases of Michelle Manalansan, Maurice Harris, Tiffany Jones, and Tiara Groves for Chicago called all four “counters.” That is, cases that he believes the police should have counted as homicides. “I’m not surprised that these cases have not come to light, based on who the victims are,” he says. “However, it is a travesty that the cases are not being investigated.” (While all cases are technically ongoing until they are closed, detectives say that death investigations are much lower priorities than homicide investigations.) As the spring of 2013 wore on, Mother Nature delivered a blessing: a deluge. That April would be the wettest on record and was relatively quiet; bad weather tends to keep criminals off the streets. Murders began ticking up again in May. And June ended with 45, only three below 2012’s total. Still, when the Chicago Police Department added up the homicides for the first half of the year, they got 184—a whopping 30 percent fewer than the year-ago period. “Fewer murders than in any year since 1965,” McCarthy told reporters. One factor, as the Tribune first noted, was that the department excluded from the count three homicides that occurred within city limits but on expressways patrolled by state police. (There would be another expressway homicide before the end of the year.) Before McCarthy’s arrival, the department did not exclude such crimes from its homicide total, according to longtime police sources. The second half of the year, of course, includes the dog days of summer, the high-crime period that really sends sweat down the backs of police leaders. And July exploded. Over the long Independence Day weekend alone, 13 people were killed and more than 70 were shot in Chicago. The ensuing days weren’t much better. “It’s mayhem,” declared one state lawmaker, Monique Davis, of the South Side. She called on Governor Pat Quinn to send the Illinois National Guard and the state police to Chicago to help keep the peace. By month’s end, the murder count had hit 53, versus 50 in July 2012. “We are not going to rest until people feel the reality of these numbers.” Mayor Rahm Emanuel at a December 15 press conference, on Chicago’s 2013 violence reduction In August—typically Chicago’s hottest month—the stress inside Chicago Police Department headquarters was palpable. That’s when several police insiders first told Chicago about what they called “the panel.” Said to be made up of a small group of very high-level officers, the panel allegedly began scrutinizing death cases in which the victims didn’t die immediately or where the circumstances that led to the deaths couldn’t be immediately determined, sources say. Panel members were looking for anything that could be delayed, keeping it off the books for a week, a month, maybe a year. “Whatever the case may be, it had to wait until it came back from the panel,” says a well-placed police insider. “All this was to hide the murder numbers, that’s all they are doing.” (How many cases did get delayed, if any, is unknown.) By the end of August the department had counted 286 homicides since January—80 fewer than in 2012. With the summer all but behind them, the police brass pretty much knew that, barring some extraordinary crime wave, the year’s homicide count would not eclipse 2012’s. But 2013’s total this far was still eight more than recorded during the same period in 2011. For McCarthy, beating the 2011 number was starting to look like an elusive goal. On September 19, two gun-toting gangbangers opened fire on a crowded pickup basketball game in Cornell Park, in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. One of them used an AK-47. When the bullets stopped flying, 13 people had been wounded, including a three-year-old boy. But no one died. A “miracle,” McCarthy said. (In the stats book, the shootings counted as only one “shooting incident” in CompStat. Read more about that in part 2 of this story.) Two days after gunfire lit up Cornell Park, an extra-alarm fire erupted in a three-story apartment building at 112th Street and King Drive, in the Roseland neighborhood. When firefighters arrived just before 2 a.m., much of the building and the stairwell was engulfed in flames. Inside, they found Millicent Brown-Johnson, 28, in a purple nightgown, her body covered in black soot, unconscious on the floor of her third-floor apartment. Her eight-year-old son, Jovan Perkins, was passed out in the stairwell, ravaged by second- and third-degree burns, according to the police report. Ambulances rushed them to the hospital. Brown-Johnson, who had been working at the American Girl Place store on Michigan Avenue as she pursued a degree in physical therapy, did not survive. Perkins, a second grader, died later that night. Firefighters and police immediately determined the fire to be suspicious. The next day they found a plastic gas container inside a garbage can in Palmer Park, across the street from the charred building. On September 28, the medical examiner’s office ruled that both mother and son had died of smoke inhalation and that, based on the police and fire department investigations, their deaths were homicides. However, the case was classified as a death investigation, not a murder investigation, and the police did not include the two deaths in their year-end homicide count. Nor have police caught the arsonist. “How will I ever get justice if the case is not even categorized the right way?” asks Austin Perkins, the boy’s father, a truck driver from Hammond, Indiana. Excluding Brown-Johnson and Perkins from Chicago’s homicide statistics helped the September numbers clock in at 42 rather than 44. At this point, the 2011 numbers were actually beginning to look beatable. Through the first nine months of 2013, the department’s murder tally was 322, versus 317 for the same period two years before. ||||| The City of Chicago touted a drop in the crime rate last year but the way these numbers were reported does not paint a full picture. The City of Chicago’s Office of the Inspector General released an audit on the Chicago Police Department’s crime statistics reporting. The audit focused on a sample of the classifications and reporting of assault crimes in 2012. According to the audit, the Inspector General’s office found that the department incorrectly classified 3.1 percent of its assault-related events. In response, the Chicago Police Department agreed with the audit findings and will be reviewing all aggravated assaults and batteries from 2012 and 2013. However, Chicago magazine published part one of a two-part series Monday titled “The Truth About Chicago’s Crime Rate,” in which reporters David Bernstein and Noah Isackson detail a number of incidents in which crimes were reclassified in order to fit the narrative that crime overall was falling in the city. “There was a sense that it was too good to be true,” Bernstein said. “You would hear Superintendent McCarthy and Mayor Emanuel talk about these massive crime drops but people in the neighborhoods didn’t see this and the cops in those areas didn’t see it.” The article details the ways in which statistics are compiled by the police force and changes in protocol that have been made in the past few years. We chat with David Bernstein about the Chicago magazine story and how the Chicago Police Department is reviewing past reporting statistics. View graphics on city crime statistics. ~ Graphics created by Taurean Small ||||| Audit of CPD Assault-Related Crime Statistics Classification And Reporting April 7, 2014 OIG found that the Chicago Police Department (CPD) incorrectly classified 3.1% of 2012 assault-related events contained in incident reports, under the 10% error rate that the FBI states is acceptable for agencies participating in its national reporting program. In addition, CPD’s CompStat reports and the City’s Data Portal accurately reflected the assault-related incidents in CPD’s data warehouse, the Criminal History Record Information System. OIG also identified significant errors in CPD’s reports to the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (I-UCR) program, which feeds into the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) system: Contrary to I-UCR reporting requirements, CPD failed to count each victim in multiple victim crimes as a separate offense. This resulted in a 24% undercount in victim offenses in the reporting sample OIG examined. CPD erroneously excluded certain crimes committed against protected persons, thereby underreporting all aggravated assaults and batteries to the I-UCR program by 5.7% and 3.2% respectively. CPD agreed with OIG’s findings and is reviewing all aggravated assaults and batteries from 2012 and 2013 to ensure the accuracy of its reports to I-UCR. CPD will also provide clearer guidance on multi-victim crime reporting in its Field Reporting Manual and, if needed, will add categories to its classification rules in order to better address I-UCR reporting needs for incidents involving protected persons. |||||","response":"Chicago has seen a noticeable drop in crime in recent years, with the number of \\"index crimes\\" reported across the city declining by 56% from 2010 to 2013. This drop has been attributed to the implementation of CompStat, a tool that collects, analyzes, and maps crime data in real time, helping the police department identify troubled areas and allocate resources more efficiently. However, there have been concerns that the crime statistics reported by the Chicago Police Department are not entirely accurate, with suggestions that some crimes, including homicides, have been misclassified or downgraded. A report by Chicago magazine in 2014 found that some homicide cases were reclassified as death investigations or noncriminal incidents for unclear or illogical reasons. The same report identified several other serious felony cases, such as robberies and assaults, that were also misclassified or downgraded. Though this practice may represent only a small percentage of reported crimes, it raises questions about the integrity of the reported statistics. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that even if some crime numbers have been manipulated, there have been genuine efforts to improve crime-fighting strategies in Chicago. The use of CompStat and the adoption of policing tactics from other cities, such as New York and Los Angeles, have contributed to an overall decline in crime. As crime rates continue to fall, it remains essential for law enforcement agencies and the public to assess their efficacy and address any discrepancies in reported statistics to ensure public safety and maintain trust in the system."},{"question":"Solve 17*b + 8 = 76 for b.

Whereas an agonist causes an action, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist and an inverse agonist causes an action opposite to that of the agonist. - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation. - Inflammation (from Latin \\"inflammatio\\") is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants, and is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and to initiate tissue repair. - Pharmacology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of drug action, where a drug can be broadly defined as any man-made, natural, or endogenous (from within body) molecule which exerts a biochemical and/or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species). More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals. - X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\". - Cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic tissue, rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible than muscle. - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Anakinra ( brand name Kineret ) is a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis . It is an interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) receptor antagonist . - A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered organ located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each \\"hand\\" and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having \\"hands\\" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having \\"hands\\" though opposable thumbs are lacking. - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission when there are few symptoms. The cause is not entirely clear. It is believed to involve hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors. Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will be as well. Female sex hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections, are also believed to increase the risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. There is no cure for SLE. Treatments may include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. Alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease. Life expectancy is lower among people with SLE. SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death. With modern treatment about 80% of those affected survive more than 15 years. Women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful. Rates of disease vary between countries from 20 to 70 per 100,000. Women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men. While it most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 45 a wide range of ages can be affected. Those of... - Efficacy is the ability to get a job done satisfactorily. The word comes from the same roots as, and for practical purposes is synonymous with, \\"effectiveness\\". It is used in pharmacology and medicine to refer to both the maximum response achievable from a pharmaceutical drug in research settings, and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings. - Lupus erythematosus is a name given to a collection of autoimmune diseases in which the human immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks healthy tissues. Symptoms of these diseases can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. The most common and severe form is systemic lupus erythematosus. - Alpha-blockers or -blockers are pharmacological agents that act as neutral antagonists or inverse agonists of -adrenergic receptors (-adrenoceptors). - A receptor antagonist is a type of receptor ligand or drug that blocks or dampens agonist-mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a receptor. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active orthosteric (= right place) site or to allosteric (= other place) sites on receptors, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonistreceptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonistreceptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of otherwise unrelated drugs defined by their use in rheumatoid arthritis to slow down disease progression. The term is often used in contrast to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (which refers to agents that treat the inflammation but not the underlying cause) and steroids (which blunt the immune response but are insufficient to slow down the progression of the disease). - Calcium channel blockers (CCB), calcium channel antagonists or calcium antagonists are several medications that disrupt the movement of calcium through calcium channels. Calcium channel blockers are used as antihypertensive drugs, i.e., as medications to decrease blood pressure in patients with hypertension. CCBs are particularly effective against large vessel stiffness, one of the common causes of elevated systolic blood pressure in elderly patients. Calcium channel blockers are also frequently used to alter heart rate, to prevent cerebral vasospasm, and to reduce chest pain caused by angina pectoris. N-type, L-type, and T-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are present in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, and CCBs can directly influence the biosynthesis of aldosterone in adrenocortical cells, with consequent impact on the clinical treatment of hypertension with these agents. - A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions. - In the field of pharmacology, an inverse agonist is an agent that binds to the same receptor as an agonist but induces a pharmacological response opposite to that agonist. A neutral antagonist has no activity in the absence of an agonist or inverse agonist but can block the activity of either. - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. - In biochemistry, a binding site is a region on a protein or piece of DNA or RNA to which ligands (specific molecules and/or ions) may form a chemical bond. An equilibrium exists between unbound ligands and bound ligands. - The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the bloodbrain barrier, bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain. - In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as 1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus; and (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as \\"wrist joints\\". This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum. - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients. - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - Psoriatic arthritis (also arthritis psoriatica, arthropathic psoriasis or psoriatic arthropathy) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that will develop in between 6 and 42% of people who have the chronic skin condition psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is classified as a seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Approximately 60% of those affected have the tissue type HLA-B27. - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (17721840) was a French surgeon best known for his description of rheumatoid arthritis. Born in Orléans, he studied under Pierre-Joseph Desault and Marie François Xavier Bichat in Paris, and then from 1792 under Jean Louis Petit in Lyon. In 1796 he obtained an internship at the famed Salpêtrière Hospital, where he assisted Philippe Pinel. He was appointed professor of clinical medicine at the Salpêtrière in 1799. After the restoration, he also held the professorship at the Paris polytechnic school. He was removed in 1830 at the insistence of King Louis-Philippe of France.

Greg had requested the most private booth, way in the back. Coreyville Pasta House was the oldest Italian restaurant in town. And still the best. Mama Castilla had run the place for over thirty years. She had taken over for her grandfather in 1973. A sign on the wall said so. Cynthia ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo.

She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap out calculations on the panel. His pointed ears swiveled back and forth, catching every sound from the bridge, while his long tail swished to the rhythm of his thoughts. Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was no common 'beta furry'. His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat. His eyes had been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive. Right now, he looked like an overgrown wolf who'd learned touch-typing. The scout ship re-emerged from the hole - a brilliant speck emerging from a sphere of velvety blackness. It's hail crackled across the comm, and Tara spun to retake her seat at the helm. \\"Launch the second probe.

This sounds like it's the one.\\" The distinctive whuffle of pleasure rippled through the betas on the bridge, and Rakal let loose a small growl, as if to caution his charges against false hope. They'd scouted twenty-seven gates so far, and none had turned up anything worth the Insurrection's time. Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that would spell the end for the project, and the Arrallin species. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why were the betas excited on the bridge?\\" is \\"They were ready to fight for their hive\\"?","response":"The betas on the bridge were excited due to the anticipation that the newly discovered gateway might be the one that the Arrallin Insurrection was searching for. They have scouted twenty-seven gates so far without finding anything worthwhile for their cause. The prospect of this new gateway possibly being the one they were looking for created a sense of hope and excitement among the betas on the bridge. Although they were eager to continue their mission, Rakal, the Alpha Arrallin, growled as a caution against getting too hopeful. So, while the betas' excitement may stem from their desire to fight for their hive, their immediate reaction in this passage relates more to the potential discovery than to imminent combat."},{"question":"Örgütün ana hedefi, karşılıklı ekonomik ilişkilerin desteklenmesi ve geliştirilmesinin yanı sıra Irak'ın yeniden yapılandırılmasına Romanya'nın yardımını ve katılımını sağlamak.

Eating sustainably means eating foods that support both your own good health and the sustainability of the environment. If you’re eating seafood, make sure that it’s not at risk of being overfished, or farmed in a way that’s damaging the environment. Try to buy from local growers whenever possible. Local farmers are usually invested in employing sustainable farm practices. Read the labels on your food products. If you don’t recognize more than ⅓ of the words found there, look for something less processed. This means eat less beef, which is higher on the food chain, and more roots, vegetables, and fruits. Smaller fish, such as anchovies, are usually better to eat than larger fish, such as tuna, which are higher up the food chain and typically higher in mercury. Plant-based foods require still less energy to produce. Shifting to a more plant-based style of eating will slow the deforestation that domestic meat production requires. Healthy diet guidelines encourage at least 50% of your daily diet consist of fruits and vegetables. If you do eat meat, treat it as a condiment rather than a main dish. Be aware that factory-farmed meat is produced in ways that contribute to greenhouse gases and environmental degradation. Learn to hunt deer for a more natural meat source. You’ll avoid the energy required to transport products from far away. In addition, getting to know your local food producers will help you understand how your food was grown and harvested. Most fresh fish must be transported by air, if it’s not local. Even out-of-season frozen fish will be more sustainable than fresh fish flown in. As the nutritional value of food diminishes with time, eating locally grown food increases the amount of nutrition you’ll receive. Many international food growers use unregulated or under-regulated environmental practices. American grown products, while not always perfect, are usually farmed with more sustainable practices. Take the time to research products you purchase regularly. Good retailers will be well-informed on the way their sellers practice sustainability. Knowing more about your farmers and food sources through your retailers can help support local business, which are invested in protecting and preserving the environment.","response":"Eating sustainably involves consuming foods that promote personal health and environmental sustainability, including local, less-processed options, plant-based meals, and responsibly-sourced seafood, while minimizing high-impact meats and supporting local food producers."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of nouns/verbs in the given sentence.

His father was Unichis. Wacho usurped the throne by assassinating (or having assassinated) his uncle, King Tato (again, probably around 510). Tato's son Ildchis fought with him and fled to the Gepids where he died. Wacho had good relations with the Franks. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul.

According to Gregory of Tours , Amalaberga now stirred up Hermanfrid against his remaining brother . Once she laid out only half the table for a meal , and when questioned about the reason , she told him \`\` A king who owns only of half of his kingdom deserved to have half of his table bare . '' Thus roused , Hermanfrid made a pact with the king of Metz , Theuderic I , to march against Baderic . Baderic was overcome by the Franks and beheaded , but Hermanfrid refused to fulfill his obligations to Theuderic , which led to enmity between the two kings . In 531 or 532 , Theuderic , his son Theudebert I , and his brother King Clotaire I of Soissons attacked the Thuringii . The Franks won a battle near the river Unstrut and took the royal seat at Scithingi ( modern Burgscheidungen ) .

In 508, he fought with King Rodulf of the Heruli, who was slain. This was a devastating blow to the Heruli and augmented the power of the Lombards. According to Paul the Deacon, the war started because Tato's daughter Rumetrada murdered Rodulf's brother. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Answer:","response":"Due to Jeff's taller stature as a result of his growth spurt during puberty, he would likely have an advantage in playing basketball over soccer. Basketball typically favors taller players as they have a greater ability to reach for rebounds, block shots, and achieve a higher shooting angle, which can lead to a higher shooting percentage. While height can also be helpful in soccer, especially for heading the ball or playing specific positions like a goalkeeper, soccer tends to rely more on agility, speed, and technical skills, which are not solely determined by height. Therefore, Jeff's size would likely provide him with a greater advantage when playing basketball compared to soccer."},{"question":"Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What separates a bay from the water? Possible A: shoreline, coast, coastal area, lake, manhattan Why is \\"shoreline\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","response":"\\"Shoreline\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to the boundary between a body of water, such as a bay, and the landmass that surrounds it. A bay is a body of water partially enclosed by land, usually with a wide opening to the sea or another larger body of water. The shoreline is the part of the land that comes into direct contact with the water, forming the natural barrier between the bay and its surrounding area. Of the possible answers provided, \\"shoreline\\" is the most accurate and specific term describing the physical boundary between a bay and the adjacent land. Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are not as aligned with human common sense as \\"shoreline\\": 1. \\"Coast\\" refers to a more extensive land area than a shoreline and includes areas beyond the immediate boundary of a bay. It is often thought of as the larger area where the land meets the sea in general, rather than being specific to the border of a bay. 2. \\"Coastal area\\" is a vague term and can cover a widely varying range of geographies, such as cliffs, beaches, or dunes. It doesn't specifically refer to the boundary between a bay and the land as a shoreline does. 3. \\"Lake\\" is a completely different type of water body, which is a natural or artificial body of water largely surrounded by land and not connected to a larger water body like the sea. It would not be appropriate to describe the separation between a bay and the water. 4. \\"Manhattan\\" is a borough in New York City and entirely unrelated to the concept of a geographical boundary between a bay and the land. Thus, \\"shoreline\\" is the answer most closely aligned with human common sense because it accurately describes the natural barrier between a bay and its surrounding land."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: Wayne A.

He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. The Seven Sorrows Polyptych, commissioned by Frederick III of Saxony in 1496, was executed by Durer and his assistants c. Around 1503-1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the Great Passion, were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers. During the same period Durer trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the Prodigal Son, which the Italian Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably Nemesis (1502), The Sea Monster (1498), and Saint Eustace (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as Pond in the Woods and Willow Mill, are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Durer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.

She said updated projections suggested Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority would run a cumulative deficit of almost £200m by 2021. SNP MSP Alex Neil called this \\"totally unacceptable\\" and a sign of \\"an organisation in crisis\\" over finance. Audit Scotland issued a highly critical report of Scotland's policing finances for the third year running in December. Ms Gardner told MSPs that \\"the lack of progress that's been made in demonstrating financial leadership is unacceptable for any public body, but particularly for one of the scale and importance of policing in Scotland\\", adding that there was \\"scope for more transparency\\" in how the £1.1bn policing budget is spent. She said: \\"To illustrate the scale of the future financial challenge, I've updated my projections of the potential funding gap facing the SPA and Police Scotland. \\"These suggest a cumulative deficit of almost £200m in real terms by the end of this parliamentary session. I consider this projection to be conservative.\\" Mr Neil suggested bringing the chief constable and other heads of the police service before the committee to give evidence. He said: \\"This is a totally unacceptable performance.

And convener Jenny Marra said the evidence was \\"incredibly worrying\\", saying the committee would be inviting police chiefs to give evidence. Police bosses have insisted progress has been made, with an initial long-term financial strategy drawn up in March 2016. A spokesman for the Scottish Police Authority said bosses \\"look forward to providing parliament with further assurance\\" on the \\"major refresh and strengthening\\" of leadership. He said: \\"While we have acknowledged issues around policing's financial performance, the operational performance of the service remains strong. \\"We are not complacent about that because we know that the demands on policing are changing, with an increasing emphasis on vulnerability, private space crimes, and online threats.

Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - Garnet Charles \`\` Chuck '' Porter ( born December 29 , 1964 ) is a Canadian politician .

Maynard had 1,218 yards on 68 receptions and 14 touchdowns in Namaths first season (Namath had 22 touchdown passes that year). In 1967, Maynard caught 1,434 of Namaths historic 4,007 passing yards. The receiving yards were a career-high for Maynard and led the league; he also had 71 receptions, 10 touchdowns, and averaged 20.2 yards per catch. In the 1968 season opener against 1968 Kansas City Chiefs season, Maynard had 200+ receiving yards for the first time in his career and passed Tommy McDonald (American football) as the active leader in receiving yards, where he remained for the next six seasons until his retirement. He added a career-best 228 yards in Game 10 against 1968 Oakland Raiders season. Maynard had 57 receptions for 1,297 yards (22.8 yards per catch) and 10 of Namaths 15 touchdowns that year. In the 1968 AFL Championship Game, a 27-23 Jets victory over the Oakland Raiders, Maynard caught six passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns. His 14-yard catch in the first quarter gave the Jets the lead and his six-yard catch in the fourth quarter proved to be the game winner. The Jets would go on to win Super Bowl III, 16-7 over the NFLs Baltimore Colts, which was hailed as the first \\"upset\\" in Super Bowl history. Maynard played, but had no catches while suffering the effects of a hamstring injury in the AFL title game.

Justification: To answer this question, first, we need to determine the prime factors of 105. The prime factors of 105 are 3, 5, and 7, since 105 = 3 × 5 × 7. Now, we know that the product of any unique pair of positive integers, say \\"a\\" and \\"b\\", giving us 105, can be represented in terms of prime factors. For example, if a = 3, then b = 5 × 7. If a = 5, then b = 3 × 7, and so on. To find every possible unique combination, we can simply identify how many ways we can create a pair by distributing the prime factors between the two integers: 1. a with 3, and b with 5 and 7 (3 × 1 and 5 × 7, i.e., 3 and 35) 2. a with 5, and b with 3 and 7 (5 × 1 and 3 × 7, i.e., 5 and 21) 3. a with 7, and b with 3 and 5 (7 × 1 and 3 × 5, i.e., 7 and 15) 4. a with 3 and 5, and b with 7 (3 × 5 and 7 × 1, i.e., 15 and 7) 5. a with 3 and 7, and b with 5 (3 × 7 and 5 × 1, i.e., 21 and 5) 6. a with 5 and 7, and b with 3 (5 × 7 and 3 × 1, i.e., 35 and 3) Since the integers should be positive, we don't consider the pairs with a factor of 1 (e.g., 1 and 105), as they won't be unique as we redistribute the prime factors. Thus, there are a total of 6 unique pairs of positive integers whose product is equal to 105."},{"question":"Article: The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda, from 164 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic.

WASHINGTON â Anthony Scaramucci President Trump's former communications director is on a list of people blocked from entering the White House without special approval. A day after saying he wasn't blocked a White House official confirmed that Scaramucci is indeed among fired officials excluded from the campus. The acknowledgment came after the financier provided to Bloomberg News official White House correspondence that confirmed he was denied an appointment. Scaramucci is among a group of former staffers who left \\"under adverse circumstances\\" placed on an \\"administrative exclusion list \\" the White House said in response to Bloomberg's questions. Those former employees must have any appointments on the premises \\"evaluated on a case by case basis.\\" Scaramucci provided emails indicating he had been denied access to the complex to counter a White House official's assertion Thursday that his claim of being blacklisted from the building was false. At the time the official - who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters - said Scaramucci was treated the same as any former staffer and would be granted access if he had legitimate official business. Scaramucci slams 'General Jackass' Kelly for blocking W.H. access When an aide on Feb. 6 tried to get Scaramucci into the building the Secret Service agent in charge of the appointment-scheduling system emailed that Scaramucci is \\"administratively excluded from entering the complex at this time (not allowed access).\\" The agent referred questions to White House Management and Administration staffer Monica Block. Another message shows that when the aide asked Block about access for Scaramucci Block said only White House chief of staff John Kelly or deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin could override Scaramucci's exclusion. The former communications adviser believes Kelly is blocking his access to the president. Scaramucci called for the chief of staff's resignation last month after disclosures that former staff secretary Rob Porter kept his job with access to top-secret information despite a background investigation that revealed allegations of domestic abuse by two of Porter's ex-wives. Scaramucci calls former White House colleague 'Sith Lord' Anthony Scaramucci with President Trump in a photo posted June 29 2017 and captioned: \\"Thanks @POTUS @realDonaldTrump thanks for a great meeting and great day.\\" ( Anthony Scaramucci via Twitter) The dispute over access to the White House comes as Scaramucci has renewed his offensive against Kelly following a chaotic week that included the resignation of Hope Hicks a longtime Trump loyalist who now holds the communications director position. \\"Does the president want to lose everyone because of General Jackass?\\" Scaramucci said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg News warning there would be \\"a further evacuation of talent.\\" Scaramucci denies claims in Trump book trashes Bannon Kelly on Friday defended his handling of the Porter scandal in a discussion with reporters saying he had obtained a resignation from the former aide within hours of learning of the abuse allegations and tightened access to classified material at the White House. Kelly did acknowledge a \\"disconnect\\" at the White House in evaluating Porter's background check and a \\"mix-up\\" in issuing a public statement supportive of the former staff secretary despite the allegations.","response":"Part #1: Generate a short title for the document.

The app can be slow to load at times, which can be frustrating when I need a quick weather update. Additionally, I have noticed occasional inaccuracies in the forecasts, although this might be due to the inherent unpredictability of weather conditions. I believe with further development and updates to iron out these issues, the India Satellite Weather app can genuinely become a 5-star tool for weather enthusiasts and anyone needing accurate and up-to-date weather information.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Christine Context: Arnold \\"Arnie\\" Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is an awkward, unpopular teen with only one friend, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell). Arnie's life begins to change when he buys a used red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury, nicknamed \\"Christine\\", in need of extensive repairs. Arnie begins to restore Christine at a local junkyard, Darnell's Autobody, but as he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses differently, and develops an arrogant personality. Dennis and Arnie's new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul), discover the car's previous owner was obsessed with Christine and had died in it due to carbon monoxide poisoning. A group of bullies at schoolâangry with Arnie after a shop class confrontation results in Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) getting expelledâvandalize Christine. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine. As he examines the ruined car, he hears the creaking of metal and notices the engine is now fully restored. Arnie tells the car \\"show me\\"; Christine restores itself to showroom quality, then seeks out the vandals; Moochie Welch (Malcolm Danare) is targeted first and crushed to death in an alley. Buddy, Richie Trelawney (Steven Tash) and Don Vandenberg (Stuart Charno) are then killed: Richie and Don are caught in a gas station explosion (which sets Christine on fire), and Buddy is run over and burned by the flaming car. The owner of the junkyard is eventually killed in the garage when he sits in the car and is crushed by the seat adjuster. On New Year's Eve, Dennis and Leigh reason that the only way to stop Christine and save Arnie is to destroy the car. Dennis scratches \\"Darnell's Tonight\\"âreferencing the name of the junkyardâinto Christine's hood, then makes his way there with Leigh. Dennis waits in a bulldozer while Leigh heads to the office so that she can shut the door after Christine arrives, trapping the car. Christine, who has been lying in wait the entire time, shines the headlights from under a pile of garbage and the car charges... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Christine,\\" Arnie Cunningham's life changes drastically after he purchases and restores a 1958 Plymouth Fury, nicknamed \\"Christine.\\" As Arnie spends more time working on the car, he undergoes a significant personality change and becomes increasingly obsessed with Christine. The car, which seems to have a mind of its own, begins to take revenge on those who have wronged Arnie by killing them in various gruesome ways. Christine's seemingly supernatural abilities and relentless killings ultimately lead Arnie's best friend Dennis and his girlfriend Leigh to believe that they need to destroy the car to save Arnie and stop the deaths. On New Year's Eve, Dennis and Leigh devise a plan to lure Christine to Darnell's Autobody, the local junkyard where Arnie has been restoring the car. Dennis scratches \\"Darnell's Tonight\\" into Christine's hood as a message and makes his way to the junkyard along with Leigh. Dennis waits in a bulldozer, while Leigh enters the office with the intention of shutting the door behind Christine once it arrives, trapping the car. Unknown to them, Christine has been hiding in the junkyard the entire time. The car reveals itself by shining its headlights from under a pile of garbage and begins to charge towards them. In the climactic final scene, Dennis uses the bulldozer to repeatedly ram and crush Christine, ultimately stopping the car's rampage and seemingly destroying its supernatural abilities. The effort to defeat the car is bittersweet, as Arnie is mortally wounded during the confrontation. He dies in Leigh's arms, unable to escape the car's dangerous influence. In summary, Christine is ultimately destroyed by Dennis and Leigh in an effort to stop the killings and save their friend Arnie. However, they are unable to save Arnie, as he succumbs to his injuries during the confrontation with the car.

Here is a hypothesis: It is catching up to older cities with their power. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To analyze if the hypothesis holds true given the premise, we must elaborate on the relationships between the premise and the hypothesis, as well as examine the factors that could influence the validity of this conclusion. Premise: Though one of Europe's youngest capitals, it's had plenty of time to catch up to Spain's more historic cities, including Seville, Toledo, and Granada, and today it is their political, administrative, and economic superior. Hypothesis: It is catching up to older cities with their power. The hypothesis states that the city in question is catching up to older cities in terms of power. From the premise, we learn that the city, despite being one of Europe's youngest capitals, has managed to surpass Spain's other historic cities in political, administrative, and economic realms. These aspects can be considered as indicators or attributes of 'power.' In general terms, power can be perceived as the ability to influence and control resources, decisions, and actions. The premise tells us that the city has caught up and is now the superior in these areas when compared to Seville, Toledo, and Granada. Having surpassed them, it indicates that the process of catching up has already occurred. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the city is still in the process of catching up. This subtle difference implies that the hypothesis doesn't align perfectly with the premise as it is worded. However, if we look beyond this difference and examine the statement's core similarity, we can see that the city has indeed demonstrated a tendency to catch up with and surpass older cities in essential facets of political, administrative, and economic strength. This observation supports the fundamental assumption of the hypothesis that the city has been challenging the power dynamics of Spain's historic cities. In light of this information, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true, the essence of the hypothesis - that the city has been catching up to older cities in terms of power - holds up. While not a perfect replication of the premise, the notion that the city has grown powerful and become the political, administrative, and economic superior of older cities in Spain is consistent with both the premise and the hypothesis."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Swayfield has over 150 houses.

Fine. I'll admit it: I am a sucker for the holidays. I've always had something of a fondness for Hallmark. Whether it's buying a card, browsing their \\"Peanuts\\" stuff, or mostly in selecting my new purchases from the given year's selection of Christmas ornaments, most of which are based around some pop culture moment that triggers some random life moment or interest. I'm probably one of the few people who starts looking forward to setting up the Christmas tree again come February. This Hallmark is very nice. It's in a good location, I enjoy chatting and joking around with the staff, and it's not that far from home so when I start getting twitchy for the annual ornament sales during the Summer and Fall, I don't have far to go. Something about the store is very \\"homey\\" (not the little plastic figures). It seems like Hallmark designs their stores with an air of \\"comfort\\" in mind, and it bodes well. Seriously, you're largely in there to cheer someone else up, aren't you? It's the cards that you give to family and friends as a thoughtful reminder, or a \\"pick me up\\". I do the cards and gifts for others. I go the \\"Pimp My Tree\\" route for myself. And voila! Everyone wins. With quite a few Hallmarks having closed in the greater area in the last few years, it's nice to see that this one is still going strong. Almost done with this year's additions. Now to start planing the tree layout....","response":"The sentiment of this review can be described as positive and nostalgic. The reviewer openly admits their love for the holidays and their fondness for Hallmark. They appreciate the store's location, homey atmosphere, and friendly staff, as well as the wide selection of ornaments and gifts. The reviewer also highlights their personal connection to the ornaments and the joy they experience when purchasing them. The fact that they mention the store is still going strong amid other Hallmark store closures adds to the positive feeling of the review."},{"question":"Attributes: name = Loch Fyne, eatType = restaurant, food = Japanese, familyFriendly = yes.

I explained that I had a wedding at 6:00 and would get to the hospital as soon as I could , probably about 7:30 . I began to make preparations for a small baptismal service as my heart broke for this young couple . Question: How would you describe the narrator ?","response":"To describe the narrator, I would go through the following steps: 1. Analyze the text: The narrator is talking about a baptism for two babies, a wedding they must attend at 6:00 PM, and their heart breaking for a young couple. 2. Identify the narrator's role: The narrator seems to have the authority to baptize the babies and is involved in the wedding ceremony, which suggests that they may be a religious or spiritual leader, like a priest or minister. 3. Determine the narrator's feelings and emotions: The narrator expresses concern for the young couple and feels heartbroken for them. This indicates that the narrator is empathetic and compassionate. 4. Assess the narrator's willingness to help: The narrator is accommodating and committed to performing the baptism even though they have a prior engagement (the wedding). This shows that they are dedicated and responsible. Based on these steps, I would describe the narrator as a compassionate and empathetic religious or spiritual leader who is dedicated and responsible in fulfilling their duties to their community."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Is it possible to conclude that \\"A person is holding two newborn puppies.\\" if \\"A person choosing which puppy they want.\\"? Options are: (i) yes. (ii) it is not possible to tell. (iii) no....I think the answer is","response":"(ii) it is not possible to tell. To justify this selection, look at the problem step by step. The statement given was, \\"A person choosing which puppy they want.\\" The task is to determine if from this sentence, one can deduce that \\"A person is holding two newborn puppies.\\" The original statement only informs us that a person is selecting a puppy. It doesn't provide information on what that selection process looks like, how many puppies are involved, or whether the person is physically holding puppies. While it is possible for someone to hold two puppies while making a selection, they might just as easily be looking at the puppies from a distance or holding a single puppy. The information is just not specific enough. Therefore it is most accurate to choose option (ii), it is not possible to tell, as we do not have sufficient information to confirm the scenario definitively."},{"question":"Given the question: Yesterday the police were joined by more than 20 volunteers in the continuing search for the two missing teenagers, Vicky Gray and Tom Hunter, and their guide, Gavin Jones.

The police said that the search had covered a wide area, but the rainforest was thick and their work was made harder by the recent rain. Later on Chief Inspector Roger Fleet said, \\"The travelers had a radio with them.

A photo of Vicky and Tom was found by a policeman under the \\"Be Careful about crocodiles\\" sign near the river. Why was the photo left behind? This is just one of the unanswered questions. Other questions are: Why was the photo left behind? Why was theToyotaparked and locked at the edge of the rainforest? The police said that the travelers had left a map of the area behind. Why? Why had someone drawn a cross on the point where the car is? Is this a sign? What does it mean?

They ruled much of Assam from the 13th century until the establishment of British rule in 1838. The Ahoms brought with them a tribal religion and a language of their own, however they later merged with the Hindu religion.

However, over time, the Ahom people and rulers gradually merged with the Hindu religion.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To find Bob's current salary, let's break this down step by step. First, we need to determine Mario's salary last year before the 40% increase. If his current salary is 4000, and that is 140% of his original salary (100% + 40%), we can represent this as: Original Salary * 140% = 4000 Now, to find Mario's original salary, we can divide the total by 140%: Original Salary = 4000 / 1.4 Original Salary ≈ 2857.14 Now that we know Mario's original salary, we can find Bob's salary last year, which was three times Mario's current salary (4000): Bob's Salary (Last Year) = 3 * 4000 Bob's Salary (Last Year) = 12000 Now that we have Bob's salary from last year, we can calculate his current salary with a 20% increase: Bob's Current Salary = Bob's Salary (Last Year) * 120% Bob's Current Salary = 12000 * 1.2 Bob's Current Salary = 14400 So, Bob's current salary is 14,400."},{"question":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = The Golden Curry, food = French, priceRange = less than £20, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers","response":"The Golden Curry is a place where families can eat tasty French food, like yummy fancy sandwiches, for under £20, and it's super close to The Bakers which means we don't have to walk too far!"},{"question":"Sometimes such funds are devoted to retraining existing nontechnical personnel to supply them with IT expertise. Does it follow that \\"Sometimes the funds are devoted to retraining existing nontechnical personnel so they understand how to program their computers.\\"?","response":"Yes, it can be inferred that sometimes the funds are devoted to retraining existing nontechnical personnel so they understand how to program their computers. It is important to note that the primary goal of such retraining programs is to equip non-IT personnel with the necessary IT skills to perform their jobs more efficiently, adapt to changing technological landscapes, and promote business growth. This process often involves several aspects, including learning how to program computers. To better understand the scope of these retraining programs, let us delve into the objectives, benefits, and potential outcomes of investing in such initiatives. Objectives of retraining non-technical personnel for IT expertise: 1. Enhancing employee skills: Non-technical employees who acquire IT skills can better understand the technologies and software used in their workplace, allowing for increased productivity. 2. Bridging the talent gap: As technology continues to evolve, companies may struggle to find qualified candidates with the necessary skill sets. By retraining existing employees, businesses can bridge this talent gap. 3. Empowering employees: Equipping non-technical personnel with IT skills allows them to explore new career paths within the organization, fostering a sense of motivation, loyalty, and growth. 4. Driving innovation: As employees gain IT expertise, they may be able to develop and implement innovative solutions, which can help businesses stay competitive in their respective industries. Benefits of devoting funds to such retraining programs: 1. Reducing turnover: Investing in employee retraining can lead to increased job satisfaction, which in turn can reduce turnover rates and associated costs such as recruitment, onboarding, and training. 2. Enhancing productivity: Retrained employees with a deeper understanding of IT and programming can optimize their work processes, leading to increased output and efficiency. 3. Improving customer service: As employees become familiar with the IT tools and systems used by the organization, they can better serve clients and address their needs more effectively. 4. Promoting collaboration: Retraining initiatives often encourage teamwork and knowledge sharing, which can result in stronger, more cohesive teams capable of tackling complex challenges. The outcomes of retraining non-technical personnel for IT expertise could vary, but some common results include: 1. Personal growth and career progression for employees who add IT and programming skills to their portfolios. 2. Enhanced collaboration between IT and non-technical departments, leading to more effective problem-solving and decision-making. 3. Streamlined business processes, resulting from the implementation of new technologies driven by retrained employees. 4. Increased competitiveness, as companies with a workforce skilled in IT and programming are better positioned to adapt to evolving technology trends. In conclusion, it does follow that at times the funds are used to retrain existing non-technical personnel to gain IT expertise such as programming their computers. The underlying motivation is to create a more skilled, efficient workforce that can keep up with the ever-changing technological landscape."},{"question":"India left Rio de Janeiro with only two medals, saving its pride from the humiliation of returning empty-handed for the first time since Barcelona 1992.

There are 40 dinner rolls available for them. Half the people eat 1 1/2 rolls each. The other half eat 1/2 a roll each. How many dinner rolls are leftover? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"To find out how many dinner rolls are leftover, we first need to calculate how many rolls are consumed by each group of people at the party. Step 1: Divide the number of people in half There are 16 people at the party, so half of them is 16/2 = 8 people. Step 2: Calculate the number of rolls consumed by the first group The first group of 8 people eats 1 1/2 rolls each. To find out how many rolls are consumed, multiply the number of people by the number of rolls per person: 8 * 1 1/2 = 8 * 3/2 = 12 rolls. Step 3: Calculate the number of rolls consumed by the second group The second group of 8 people eats 1/2 a roll each. To find out how many rolls are consumed, multiply the number of people by the number of rolls per person: 8 * 1/2 = 4 rolls. Step 4: Add the number of rolls consumed by both groups To find out the total number of rolls consumed, add the rolls consumed by the first group to those consumed by the second group: 12 rolls (from the first group) + 4 rolls (from the second group) = 16 rolls. Step 5: Find out how many rolls are leftover There were initially 40 dinner rolls available. Subtract the total number of rolls consumed from the initial amount to find out how many rolls are leftover: 40 rolls - 16 rolls = 24 rolls.

For instance, is it a header for a table or a section, or a sentence in a document? Due to the lack of contextual details, I'll proceed with the most standard interpretations. Here's the requested translation: \\"OBJECTIFS NATIONAUX Migrants et minorités ethniques handicapés Autres groupes ou objectifs\\" Here's a step by step explanation of a translation process: 1. NATIONAL TARGETS - \\"Objectifs Nationaux\\": National targets usually refer to the goals or aims set by a country. The French equivalent of 'national' is 'nationaux' (considering 'targets' as masculine), and 'targets' can be roughly translated to 'objectifs', which refers to goals or aims. 2. Migrants and ethnic minorities - \\"Migrants et minorités ethniques\\": 'Migrants' remains the same in both languages. 'Ethnic minorities' translates to 'minorités ethniques'. 3. Disabled - \\"Handicapés\\": This term translates directly to 'handicapés'. 4. Other groups or targets - \\"Autres groupes ou objectifs\\": 'Other' translates to 'autres', 'groups' to 'groupes', 'or' to 'ou', and 'targets' to 'objectifs' again. While there's no direct one-for-one translation in many cases due to the nuances and context of each language, this is a fairly standard and direct translation, attempting to maintain fidelity to the source's meaning."},{"question":"CHAPTER XVIII.

Like the flowers themselves, Albinia was feeling the delicious repose of refreshed nature, as in her pretty pink muslin, her white drapery folded round her, and her bright hair unbonnetted, she sat reclining in a low garden chair, at the door of the conservatory, a little pale, a little weak, but with a sweet happy languor, a soft tender bloom. There was a step in the conservatory, and before she could turn round, her brother Maurice bent over her, and kissed her. 'Maurice! you have come after all!' 'Yes, the school inspection is put off.

The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently from other ones. Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or \\"staff\\", in an object. Another kind of black hole is called \\"stellar\\" . Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way. The largest black holes are called \\"supermassive\\" . These black holes have masses that are more than one million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large _ contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy has a mass equal to about four million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began. Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or falls apart. When this happens, it exploded part of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in. A black hole can not be seen because strong gravity pulls all of the light into the middle of the black hole. But scientists can see how the strong gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole. Scientists can study stars to find out if they are flying around, or orbiting a black hole. When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. This kind of light cannot be seen with human...

Ralph Baer's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow gamers to turn on and off certain components of the console (the Odyssey lacked a CPU) to create slightly different games like tennis, volleyball, hockey, and chase. Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game. Although Baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games, the carts released by Magnavox all served the same function as the switches and allowed gamers to choose from the Odyssey's built-in games.

In what Arizona town was it located?","response":"The famous shootout at the OK Corral took place on October 26th, 1881, in the town of Tombstone, located in southeastern Arizona. Tombstone was founded in 1879 by prospector Ed Schieffelin and soon became an important mining town with the discovery of rich silver deposits in the area. As the town's population grew and attracted a diverse mix of miners, merchants, cattlemen, and outlaws, tensions and conflicts were inevitable. The famous shootout was a result of escalating tensions between two factions: the lawmen led by town Marshal and deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, along with his brothers, assistant town Marshal Morgan Earp and temporary special policeman Wyatt Earp, and their friend, dentist-turned-gambler and part-time lawman Doc Holliday; and a group of outlaw cowboys, including Ike and Billy Clanton, Tom and Frank McLaury, and Billy Claiborne. The situation that led to the shootout was a combination of personal disagreements, political tensions, and criminal activities. The Earps held a strong belief in upholding law and order, while the Clantons and McLaurys were allegedly involved in cattle rustling and other illegal activities. These differences, coupled with personal grudges, fueled the animosity between the two groups. On the morning of October 26th, 1881, Ike Clanton got into a heated argument with Doc Holliday and the Earps, resulting in Clanton being fined and disarmed by Virgil Earp for violating the city's ordinance against carrying firearms within city limits. Later that day, the armed cowboys, in defiance of the law and the Earps, congregated near the OK Corral, a small livery stable and corral located on the outskirts of Tombstone. As the lawmen approached the cowboys to disarm them, a confrontation ensued and turned into a deadly 30-second shootout, leaving Billy Clanton, Tom McLaury, and Frank McLaury dead, and Virgil and Morgan Earp injured. Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday remained unharmed. The incident brought nationwide attention and has since been immortalized in books, plays, and movies, ultimately making the names Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday synonymous with the Wild West. In the aftermath of the shootout, several trials and investigations took place, and the event's impact only served to further divide the people of Tombstone. The dramatic gunfight at the OK Corral has come to symbolize a time and place in American history when the lawless frontier began to give way to a more civilized society as it struggled to maintain order against the backdrop of the rugged and untamed landscape."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: What is the alternate title of the movie Dr. Strangelove? How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb The answer to this question is:","response":"The alternate title of the movie Dr. Strangelove is \\"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\". Directed by Stanley Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove is a black comedy that satirizes the Cold War and nuclear conflict. Collaboratively written by Kubrick, Peter George, and Terry Southern, the movie was released in 1964. The plot of the movie could be built around the full title. The story could follow the main character, Dr. Strangelove, who is a brilliant but eccentric scientist working within the government during a period of heightened global tension. The world is on the brink of nuclear war, and Dr. Strangelove possesses knowledge that could either save or doom the planet. Initially, he is wracked with anxiety over the impending catastrophe, symbolized by the phrase, \\"How I Learned to Stop Worrying\\". His perspective starts to change when he stumbles across an unforeseen scientific discovery about the bomb. This discovery unexpectedly humanizes the weapon for him. As the story progresses, we could see him wrestling with his anxieties and ethics as he is placed in situations where he may need to endorse or activate the bomb. \\"Love the Bomb\\" could signify his ultimate acceptance of the destructive object not as a symbol of annihilation, but as a scientific marvel, a deterrent to war, or even to avert the greater catastrophe. This plot could serve as a satirical commentary on war and peace, the ethics of nuclear power, and humanity's constant struggle to navigate and control forces that sometimes seem uncontrollable. In true Kubrick style, the narrative would explore the dualities of anxiety and acceptance, destruction and creation, and fear and love. At its core, the movie would serve as a profound exploration into the paradoxical 'romance' between humanity and its creations."},{"question":"\\"Shorea tumbuggaia\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

The app has a simple and user-friendly interface, which made it easy for me to scan various barcodes right off the bat. It is also quite fast in detecting barcodes, providing me with accurate and reliable results. However, I did encounter a few minor issues that prevent me from giving it a perfect 5-star rating. For one, the app occasionally struggled to recognize certain QR codes, requiring me to adjust the angle and distance multiple times before successfully scanning.

Saladas Department is a department of Argentina in the province of Corrientes .","response":"Yes, both statements essentially convey the same information, but with slightly different sentence structures. In the first statement, \\"Saladas Department is a department of the Province of Corrientes in Argentina,\\" the focus is on the location hierarchy. It emphasizes that Saladas Department is a part of the Province of Corrientes, which in turn is a part of Argentina. This provides the geographical context in a nested manner, from the larger entity (Argentina) to the smaller units (Province of Corrientes and, finally, Saladas Department). In the second statement, \\"Saladas Department is a department of Argentina in the province of Corrientes,\\" the sentence structure places Argentina first and then specifies the province of Corrientes within Argentina. This statement also provides the same geographical context, just with a different emphasis, starting with the country (Argentina), followed by the province (Corrientes), and finally specifying the department (Saladas Department).

Article: Violent winds swept the ocean, and waves thundered to shore, shaking the lookout tower at Pea Island Rescue Station. Surfman Theodore Meekins was on watch that evening of 11 October 1896. A hurricane had struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the tide was so strong that beach patrols had been canceled. Still, Meekins paid close attention to the horizon. This was the type of weather that could blow ships hundreds of miles off course. Offshore, the ship E.S. Newman was caught in the storm. The captain, whose wife and child were on the ship, feared the Newman would soon break up. He made the decision to beach his ship, then fired a signal, praying that someone onshore would see it. Meekins, whose eyes were trained to cut through rain and surf mists, thought he saw the signal, but so much spray covered the lookout windows that he could hardly make sure. Still, he took no chances. After summoning the station keeper, Captain Richard Etheridge, Meekins set off a coston signal, a signal made by using lamps of different colors. Together, the two men searched the darkness for a reply. A few moments later, they saw a flash of light to the south and knew a shop was in distress . Even before the return signal burned out, Etheridge had summoned his men and begun rescue operations. For the lifesavers, the rescue of the Newman was nothing unusual. Over the years, so many ships had off the Outer Banks that sailors called the region the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Noting the dangerous surf and wind conditions, Captain Etheridge quickly decided the surf boats would be impossible to control. Instead, he decided to use another way to help the survivors. The crew set off on the long journey down the beach to the scene of the wreck . Captain Etheridge hoped to fire a line from a gun to the ship's mast . After the ship's crew dragged the line onboard, the surfmen would fire a second line and carry survivors safely to shore. The surfmen crossed three miles of sand to reach the ship Newman.

They supported the tenets of Origenist thought and theology, but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled \\"Arian\\" did not consider themselves followers of Arius. In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops. However, others point to the Council of Nicaea as proof in and of itself that Arianism was a real theological ideology.[citation needed] Question: Did all Arians believe the same things?","response":"No, not all Arians believed in the same things. Although it is common to view the Arian Party as a monolithic entity espousing a singular set of beliefs, recent scholarship has come to challenge this perception. Instead, it is now believed that the Arian Party was a more diverse group of individuals and their theological views varied across the spectrum of early Christian thought. One common thread shared by the Arians was their support for Origenist thought and theology, which was derived from the teachings of the early Christian theologian Origen. Origenism emphasized the pre-existence of souls, the allegorical interpretation of scriptures, and a belief in the final restoration of all souls to God (apokatastasis). However, beyond these shared tenets, individual Arian beliefs diverged significantly. It is important to note that many individuals labeled as \\"Arian\\" did not explicitly identify as followers of Arius, the presbyter and theologian from Alexandria who lent his name to the movement. In fact, some non-Homoousian bishops – who rejected the concept of the Son being of the same substance as the Father – took issue with being labeled as followers of Arius. These bishops, being fully ordained, did not appreciate being compared to a mere presbyter. The Council of Nicaea, convened in 325 CE, also played a role in contributing to the misconception of Arianism as a homogenous theological ideology. Although the council aimed to resolve the controversy surrounding the nature of the relationship between the Father and the Son, it led to the development of the Nicene Creed, which reinforced the view of Arianism as a cohesive theological perspective. The resulting debate surrounding Arianism and its rejection at the Council of Nicaea may have unintentionally contributed to the simplification of the movement's beliefs. In summary, it is incorrect to assume that all Arians believed in the same things. The Arian Party was, in fact, a more diverse group with theological views that spanned a wide range of early Christian beliefs. It is essential to recognize this complexity to better understand the nuances of the theological debates and controversies that shaped the early Christian Church."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Bay city practiced organic farming and used almost no fertilizers. Gulf city practiced conventional farming for it inhabitants, and used vast quantities of fertilizers. Which city caused the entry of less livestock waste into the ocean? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Answer:","response":"Considering the information provided, Bay City is more likely to have caused less livestock waste and other pollutants to enter the ocean compared to Gulf City. There are a few reasons for this conclusion. First, Bay City practiced organic farming, which means they used little to no synthetic fertilizers. Organic farming methods typically involve using natural fertilizers like compost and animal manure, which are much less likely to create runoff and pollute nearby water sources, including rivers and streams that ultimately reach the ocean. Second, Gulf City practiced conventional farming methods, which involve the use of large amounts of synthetic fertilizers. These fertilizers often contain high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, which can contribute to water pollution when they are washed into rivers and streams. As the hint mentions, the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals from the fertilizers in water bodies can lead to issues like hypoxia and the creation of dead zones. In conclusion, due to Bay City's organic farming practices and reduced use of synthetic fertilizers, it likely caused less livestock waste and other pollutants to enter the ocean in comparison to Gulf City's conventional farming practices and heavy use of fertilizers."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"Two hockey teams are facing off.\\" can we conclude that \\"A group of people are playing hockey.\\"?

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.

OULED GACEM, Algeria A military transport plane carrying members of the Algerian armed forces and their relatives crashed into a mountain on Tuesday, killing 77 people, the worst air disaster in the North African country in a decade. State television showed footage of the wreckage of the plane near the village of Ouled Gacem in eastern Algeria, smoke rising from the site and emergency crews scouring the forested area for survivors and bodies. \\"I saw the military plane crashing, and it was cut into two pieces,\\" Mohamed, a fireman told Reuters at Ouled Gacem, near the crash site in Oum El Bouaghi province, 500 km (300 miles) east of Algiers. Colonel Lahmadi Bouguern told the APS state news agency that 99 passengers and four crew were on board the C-130 Hercules transport plane, which took off from the southern Tamanrasset province and was bound for Constantine. The Defence Ministry said 77 people were killed and said the crash was likely due to bad weather. Initial reports in Algerian media had put the death toll at 103. \\"The plane crashed into a mountain and exploded. Several bodies were burnt to ashes and could not be identified,\\" one official told Reuters by telephone from the area. State television said President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had declared three days of mourning from Wednesday.

A civil defense official said 102 people on board were... (Associated Press) Air traffic controllers lost radio and radar contact with the U.S.-built C-130 Hercules turboprop just before noon and dispatched helicopters to try to find it. The plane was discovered in pieces on Mount Fortas near the town of Ain Kercha, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of Constantine, the main city in eastern Algeria. The plane was heading to Constantine from the southern Saharan city of Tamanrasset, which has a massive military presence due to its proximity to the country's unstable southern borders. It was at least 24 years old, according to sales information supplied by its maker, Lockheed Martin Corp. The plane carried 74 passengers and four crew members, the military said in its statement, blaming poor weather for the crash. Earlier in the day, Algerian government officials and Algerian state media had reported that the plane had 99 passengers, making for a much higher death toll. The lone survivor — a soldier — suffered head injuries and was treated at a nearby military facility before being flown to the military hospital in Algiers, a retired Algerian intelligence officer told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Civil defense officials at the snowy crash site said the plane broke into three parts and women and children were among the dead. Military transports in Algeria routinely carry not only soldiers but military families and sometimes even other civilians, if space is available. Commander Farid Nechad, who was coordinating recovery efforts, told the AP that 55 bodies had been recovered so far but conditions at the crash site were difficult. \\"Unfavorable weather conditions and storms accompanied by snow in the region were behind the crash,\\" the defense ministry said. The presidency announced a three-day period of mourning, calling the soldiers who had died \\"martyrs for the country.\\" Lockheed Martin's hulking C-130 Hercules transport, born out of the experiences of the 1950-53 Korean War, has been used by air forces all over the world to help fight wars or save lives in humanitarian situations. Lockheed Martin confirmed that it sold C-130s to Algeria from 1981 to 1990 and said if Algerian authorities asked, the company would work with them to investigate Tuesday's crash. It did not release specific information on the age of the plane. In other crashes involving similar planes, six people died in November 2012 when an Algerian Air Force C-130 crashed into a hillside in France, according to the Aviation Safety Network's database. In 2003, 10 people died when an Algerian Air Force C-130 crashed after an engine caught fire shortly after it took off from an air base near Boufarik, Algeria, according to the database. The worst plane crash in Algerian history occurred in 2003, when 102 people were killed after a civilian airliner crashed at the end of the runway in Tamanrasset. There was also a single survivor in that crash. Sole survivors of large plane crashes are extremely rare, said Ky Dickens of Chicago, director and co-producer of a documentary on such survivors. Dickens, who began research for her film in 2010, identified 15 sole survivors around the world. She limited her search to commercial planes carrying more than 40 people. Many sole survivors are either children or a member of the flight crew — a flight attendant or pilot, Dickens said. ___ Schemm reported from Rabat.

Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients?

Use a castor oil pack and heating pad to reduce swelling. Take phosphatidylcholine 1 to 2 times a day to dissolve gallstones. Try acupuncture to relieve pain and improve gallbladder function.\\"","response":"Title: Natural Remedies to Improve Gallbladder Health and Function Introduction: The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver, responsible for storing bile and assisting in the digestion of fats. Gallstones, inflammation, and other issues can affect the gallbladder, leading to discomfort and impaired function. If you wish to maintain a healthy gallbladder and alleviate pain associated with gallstones or other issues, consider incorporating these natural remedies into your daily routine. 1. Herbal Tea: A Soothing and Beneficial Beverage Drinking 2 to 4 cups of herbal tea a day provides numerous benefits for gallbladder health. Herbal teas, such as dandelion, milk thistle, and peppermint, have been known to stimulate bile production and encourage optimal gallbladder function. By integrating these teas into your daily routine, you can help maintain a healthy digestive system and reduce the risk of developing gallstones. 2. Castor Oil Pack: A Warm and Relaxing Solution for Swelling Applying a castor oil pack with a heating pad can aid in reducing swelling and alleviate discomfort associated with an inflamed gallbladder. Castor oil has anti-inflammatory properties, while heat helps relax muscles and improve blood circulation. To perform this remedy, soak a piece of clean cloth in cold-pressed castor oil. Place the cloth over the affected area and cover it with a heating pad set on a low to medium temperature for 45 minutes to an hour. Repeat this process two to three times a week for optimal results. 3. Phosphatidylcholine: A Supplement that Helps Dissolve Gallstones Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a natural supplement that can help break down gallstones and improve overall gallbladder health. PC is a major component of lecithin, which is found in egg yolks, soybeans, and sunflower seeds. By supplementing with PC 1 to 2 times per day, the body's bile composition can be improved, which helps dissolve gallstones and prevent their formation. Consult your healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen, especially if you have any preexisting health conditions or are taking medications. 4. Acupuncture: An Ancient Technique to Support Gallbladder Function Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. This practice can help relieve pain and stimulate proper gallbladder function by balancing the body's energy flow. While acupuncture may not be suitable for everyone, it is worth considering as a natural approach to gallbladder health, especially for those who are seeking a non-invasive, holistic remedy. Consult a licensed and experienced acupuncture practitioner to discuss your symptoms and receive personalized treatment. Conclusion: Maintaining gallbladder health is crucial for proper digestion and overall well-being. By incorporating natural remedies, such as drinking herbal tea, using a castor oil pack, taking phosphatidylcholine supplements, and trying acupuncture, you can address gallbladder issues and promote a healthier, pain-free lifestyle. Take control of your gallbladder health and improve its function with these effective and time-tested remedies."},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop? is inside the article: The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","response":"Hans Memling.

(idk, the analogy fits in my mind). this girl goes all out. perfect water temperature, massages my scalp and my neck! i'm sitting here feeling absolutely amazing! she finishes up, puts some product in my hair and i'm feeling really good about how i look and feel. this girl definitely earned her tip. we walk over to the register and i swipe my card and await the prompt on the screen to add the tip. my total comes to 16.20. 5.00 tip is more than fair, especially since she went all out with the head massage. i punch in my tip amount and immediately hit the confirm button. as i wait for my recept, i watch the girls eyes get huge and she looks at me in excitiment. she run from behind the counter and hugs me! i'm flabbergasted! she starts getting teary eyes and stumbles over herself to say \\"thank you\\" over and over. i'm thinkin, man, it's just 5 bucks, but i won't say no to a hug from a cute random girl. she hands me my recept and i start to make my way to the door when i realize what had happened. when i punched in the 5.00, i accidentally hit the 0 an extra time... i tipped her 50.00 instead of 5.00. shit. at this point i need to make a decision. do i wreck this girls day by admitting i made a mistake, or do i just eat the 66.00 hair cut? i turn around and take another look at her. she's still so excited, looking close to tears. she's probably thinking she's so lucky that this guy just came in, sat in her chair, and just helped her make her christmas a little bit better out of the kindness of his heart. i look at my recept again and sigh to myself. \\"merry christmas!\\" i turn and leave, leaving a little bit of christmas spirit and a nice chunk of my bank account. edit: i'm male, stylist was female. edit2: holy crap my inbox... so to clear up a few things. i've always gotten my hair washed after the cut. this helps wash away the hair clippings so you're not itching all day. i do my hair stylists a favor by washing my hair before each cut. no i didn't shit on her chair. i go to a hair cuttery. i like it there. people are nice and a cut is 20. 16.20 with military discount. i find it insane that people drop 50-100 every time they get a hair cut, but that's just me :) as said above, i'm in the military, so i get my hair cut every two weeks. thanks for all the kind words and encouragement to attempt to go on a date with this hair dresser... if i can muster up the courage, i might, but i don't know if i want to rock the boat at a place i enjoy getting my hair cut. also, i'm less than 8 months from moving, not sure if nows the time to start a relationship. i'm really glad some people can get a nice story from this, and if i changed a few lives because of it, that's all the gratuity i need. i just want the world i live in to be a bit better. the 50 would have gone to buying fallout, but i'll be just fine picking it up after the new year. merry christmas ya'll one more edit i promise. thank you all who are offering to purchase fallout for me, i really do appreciate the offer, but there are plenty of other people who would really benefit from your generosity more so than me. you guys are awesome!

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). - The common dolphin is the name given to two species ( and possibly a third ) of dolphin making up the genus Delphinus . Prior to the mid- 1990s , most taxonomists only recognised one species in this genus , the common dolphin Delphinus delphis . Modern cetologists usually recognise two species -- the short - beaked common dolphin , which retains the systematic name Delphinus delphis , and the long - beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis . The common dolphin is not the dolphin of popular imagination despite its name ; that distinction belongs to the bottlenose dolphin due to its widespread use in marine parks and its appearance in the television series Flipper . However , this dolphin was the most frequently represented in the art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \\"whale\\" rather than \\"dolphin\\", such as the killer whale and the pilot whales. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea. - River dolphins are a widely distributed group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. - Iniidae is a family of river dolphins containing one living and four extinct genera. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago. - Cetacea are a widely distributed and diverse clade of aquatic mammals that today consists of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetaceans are carnivorous and finned. Most species live in the sea, some in rivers. The name is derived from the Latin \\"cetus\\" \\"whale\\" and Greek \\"ketos\\" \\"huge fish\\". - Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'delphinidae'.

All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean.

The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - Firaxis Games, Inc. is an American video game developer founded in 1996 by Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs, and Brian Reynolds upon leaving MicroProse. Now a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, the company is best known for its \\"Civilization\\" series of games, though it has had notable success with other titles as well. Firaxis is based in Sparks, Maryland; Sid Meier continues to lead creative efforts there. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). - The video game industry (sometimes referred to as the interactive entertainment industry) is the economic sector involved with the development, marketing and sales of video games. It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and employs thousands of people worldwide. - The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations, charged with the maintenance of international peace and security as well as accepting new members to the United Nations and approving any changes to its United Nations Charter.

The original line up by MicroProse included six published and at least two cancelled games, as well as two novels. The \\"X-COM\\" series, in particular its original entry, achieved a sizable cult following and has influenced many other video games; including the creation of a number of clones, spiritual successors, and unofficial remakes. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Sidney K. \\"Sid\\" Meier (born February 24, 1954) is a programmer, designer, and producer of several popular strategy video games and simulation video games, most notably the \\"Civilization\\" series. Meier co-founded MicroProse in 1982 with Bill Stealey and is the Director of Creative Development of Firaxis Games, which he co-founded with Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds in 1996. He has won several prestigious accolades for his contributions to the video game industry. - Dr. Jeffery L. Briggs (born March 10, 1957, in Florence, Alabama) is founder and former President and CEO of Firaxis Games, a video game developer based in Hunt Valley, Maryland, United States. He was previously a game designer at MicroProse but left that company in 1996 along with Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds to form Firaxis Games. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - The Partnership for Peace (PfP) is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) program aimed at creating trust between NATO and other states in Europe and the former Soviet Union; 22 states are members. It was first discussed by the Bulgarian Society Novae, after being proposed as an American initiative at the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Travemünde, Germany, on 2021 October 1993, and formally launched on 1011 January 1994 NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium. - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977. - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - MOS Technology, Inc. (\\"MOS\\" being short for Metal Oxide Semiconductor), also known as CSG (Commodore Semiconductor Group), was a semiconductor design and fabrication company based in Norristown, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is most famous for its 6502 microprocessor and various designs for Commodore International's range of home computers. - A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \\"board\\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery. - Strategy (from Greek \\"stratgia\\", \\"art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship\\") is a high level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty. In the sense of the \\"art of the general\\", which included several subsets of skills including \\"tactics\\", siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in East Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. From then until the 20th century, the word \\"strategy\\" came to denote \\"a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills\\" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact. - A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by a video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising. - Albania (; ), officially the Republic of Albania, is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe.

The player takes the roll of the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe as they respond to a massive Warsaw Pact attack . The goal is to slow their advance and inflict casualties , hoping to force a diplomatic end to the war before West Germany is overrun . The same game engine was also used as the basis for Conflict in Vietnam , Crusade in Europe and Decision in the Desert . - The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer. It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993. The Apple II marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market branded towards American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists. - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A simulation video game describes a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality. - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - Stephen (or Stephan) Gary \\"Steve\\" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), nicknamed \\"Woz\\", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc. He is known as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The MOS Technology 6502 (typically \\"\\"sixty-five-oh-two\\"\\" or \\"\\"six-five-oh-two\\"\\") is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology. When it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was, by a considerable margin, the least expensive full-featured microprocessor on the market. It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as Motorola and Intel, and caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market. Along with the Zilog Z80 it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s. - Apple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for 500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California. - A strategy game or strategic game is a game (e.g. video or board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome.

It was based on the 1961 book \\"Car, Boy, Girl\\" by Gordon Buford. - Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing or automobile racing) is a sport involving the racing of automobiles for competition. - In sport, racing is a competition of speed, against an objective criterion, usually a clock or to a specific point. The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. - An economy car is an automobile that is designed for low cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. - Herbie the Love Bug is an anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle , a character that is featured in several Disney motion pictures starting with the 1968 feature film The Love Bug .

Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.

It cost me about 250, which isn’t a whole lot of money but definitely isn’t nothing either. Less than a week later I discover she has been frequently texting her ex though she told me several months ago she had stopped. We have only been together about 8 months but this has been an ongoing issue with her so I decided to not allow myself to be played or lied to anymore and simply cut my losses. When I first bought the fridge one of my friends asked where I bought it as he was considering buying one for himself. I’m fairly certain he will be willing to buy it from me even if at a discount being that it is already out of the packaging. If she had had it for a few months before I discovered her lies I would just let her keep it but being that it was not even a week I feel like maybe I have the right to ask for it back. She is selfish but not a bad person and I believe she will give it back to me if I ask her. I should probably also mention that in October we took a trip to Halloween Horror Nights and we agreed we would split the gas (we took my car) and she would pay me back the 160 I spent for her ticket and I would cover the hotel. I ended up paying 80% of the gas and she never again brought up the 160 she owes me even though it was made very clear and she fully understood she was supposed to pay her share.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. and the situation: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L.

Article: Is it possible to persuade mankind to live without war? War is an ancient custom which has existed for at least six thousand years. It was always evil and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it. Modern skill has changed this. Either man will stop war, or war will stop man. For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the greatest danger, but bacteriological( ) or chemical weapons may, before long, offer an even greater threat. If we succeeded in stopping war, there would be no danger for us. To do this, we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not by contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in massacre ( ),but by judging in accordance with agreed rules of law. It is not easy to change old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted. There are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology would prevent war. I believe this to be a complete error. All ideologies are based upon beliefs without proof which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false. Those people who believe them are willing to go to war in support of them. The movement of world opinion during the past two years has changed very largely such as we can welcome. It has become a common belief that nuclear war must be avoided. Of course, very difficult problems remain in the international world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago. It has begun to be thought, even by the powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that agreements should be reached even if both sides do not find these agreements wholly satisfactory.

Question: What does the third solution say about quantum mechanics? Context: A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.[citation needed] A:","response":"The third solution in the provided context suggests that the laws of quantum mechanics are not time-reversible, specifically regarding certain processes related to the weak nuclear force. However, it also mentions that this solution is insufficient to explain the direction of time because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it is based on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates - Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow - Acid and enzyme in the stomach break the food down - Releases nutrients - Food then pumped into small intestine - Fluid and enzymes from liver and pancreas pumped into small intestine - Help break food into smallest molecules - Nutrients pass through wall of small intestine - Nutrients absorbed into blood stream - Unused materials passed into large intestine to become fecal matter. Question: suppose nutrients are destroyed happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If nutrients in the food are destroyed, it has the potential to affect the digestion process and may lead to reduced absorption of essential nutrients. The subsequent steps in the digestion process can experience varying levels of impact, depending on what is causing the destruction of nutrients and the specific nutrients involved. In this scenario, we will consider the potential consequences on the given steps of digestion. 1. An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates: If nutrients are destroyed, there may be a decrease in the breakdown of carbohydrates. The enzymes in saliva, such as amylase, may have reduced effectiveness if they do not have sufficient substrates to work on due to degraded nutrients. 2. Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow: There would be no significant effect on this process since the mechanical action of swallowing remains the same irrespective of the nutrient content of the food. 3. Acid and enzymes in the stomach break food down further: If nutrients are destroyed, more food may need to be consumed to meet the body's nutritional requirements. With more food in the stomach, there might be an increase in gastric acid and enzymes produced to break down larger amounts of food. 4. Releases nutrients: Since nutrients are destroyed, the process of releasing these nutrients would become less effective. The body would need to adjust to this change and may compensate by focusing more on undamaged nutrients or stimulating appetite to increase nutrient intake. 5. Food then pumped into the small intestine: Due to the presence of fewer nutrients, the food being pumped into the small intestine might be less substantial, leading to a decreased transit time and incomplete absorption of the remaining nutrients. 6. Fluid and enzymes from the liver and pancreas pumped into the small intestine: The liver and pancreas may need to produce more enzymes and fluids to break down the increased volume of food consumed to compensate for the destroyed nutrients. This could lead to an increased workload on the digestive system. 7. Help break food into the smallest molecules: The destroyed nutrients would have less or no effect on this process since the remaining functional enzymes would continue to facilitate the breakdown of food. 8. Nutrients pass through the wall of the small intestine: The absorption of destroyed nutrients would be significantly affected, leading to fewer nutrients being available for absorption into the bloodstream. 9. Nutrients absorbed into the bloodstream: The absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream might be reduced due to fewer available nutrients for absorption. 10. Unused materials passed into the large intestine to become fecal matter: The unused materials, including destroyed nutrients, would be passed into the large intestine and converted to fecal matter. This process might not change significantly. In summary, if nutrients are destroyed, the overall process of digestion could experience substantial perturbation by breaking down larger amounts of food to compensate for lost nutrients. This could lead to increased workload on the digestive system, decreased effectiveness of nutrient release, lesser absorption of nutrients, and the need for the body to adapt through other mechanisms to address nutrient deficiencies."},{"question":"Data: Adam McQuaid, weight, 94.8024 (kilograms) Sentence about the following data:","response":"Adam McQuaid is a person who weighs 94.8 kilograms, which is like carrying 94 small bags of sugar."},{"question":"Instructions: You will be given a context and a question in Spanish. Your job is to generate answers that are at least THREE words long. The answers need to be context specific and can not be general knowledge or a random guess. Input: CONTEXT: 8 de diciembre de 2008 La Guardia Civil y la Policía francesa han detenido este lunes a tres miembros de la banda armada ETA, entre ellos Aitzol Iriondo, considerado el número uno de la organización tras la detención, a mediados de noviembre, de Mikel Garokoitz Aspiazu, \\"Txeroki\\". La operación se ha realizado al sur de Francia, en la localidad de Gerde. La ministra francesa de Interior, Michèle Alliot-Marie, fue la encargada de informar sobre estas detenciones. Además de Iriondo, también han sido detenidos Eneko Zarrabeitia, alias \\"Sorgin\\", y Aitor Artetxe. Al parecer, el arresto se produjo cuando los tres acudían a una cita en una iglesia de la localidad francesa. Estaban armados y llevaban documentación falsa. La detención de Aitzol Iriondo es considerada clave ya que el etarra escaló un puesto en la banda tras la detención de Txeroki, convirtiéndose en el nuevo jefe militar de ETA. Se trataba, por ello, de uno de los etarras más buscados tras huir a Francia en octubre de 2002, con la desarticulación del \\"talde\\" denominado \\"K-Zelatun\\" de apoyo al \\"comando Donosti\\". Aitzol Iriondo se había convertido en el principal pistolero de ETA y el brazo ejecutor de dos de los atentados de la banda terrorista en el último año: el doble crimen de los guardias civiles Fernando Trapero y Raúl Centeno (el 1 de diciembre de 2007 en Capbreton, Francia), y el asesinato del ex concejal socialista Isaías Carrasco (el 7 de marzo de este año en Mondragón, Guipúzcoa). Al parecer, Aitzol Iriondo Yarza, alias 'Gurbita', 'Barbas' y 'Asier', de 31 años, perpetró los tres asesinatos usando pistolas 'limpias', es decir, que no habían sido utilizadas en ningún atentado anterior. En su historial se le relaciona con otros atentados mortales. En concreto, como integrante del 'Comando Donosti', con el del jefe de la Policía Municipal de Andoain, Joseba Pagazaurtundua, asesinado en febrero de 2003. Fue detenido por primera vez en 1994 por actos de kale borroka. Estas detenciones se producen cinco días después del último atentado mortal de ETA, que asesinó el pasado miércoles al empresario vasco Ignacio Uria Mendizabal en la localidad Azpeitia (Guipúzcoa). Sobre Eneko Zarrabeitia y Aitor Artetxe, el ministro de Interior español, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, informó que el primero perteneció al \\"comando Cantabria\\" de ETA que no llegó a atentar, y el segundo es un huido del \\"comando Vizcaya\\". «Aitzol Iriondo, nuevo jefe militar de ETA según fuentes policiales» — Wikinoticias, 19 de noviembre de 2008.

For this task, I'll select the movie \\"Disappointment: The Motion Picture\\" (a fictional movie). Step 2: Outline negative key points I'll now outline a few key points to focus on that will convey the negative sentiment. These points will be about the plot, acting, directing, and overall production value. Key Points: - Weak and predictable plot - Poor acting performances - Ineffective directing - Bad cinematography - Low production value Step 3: Write the introduction The introduction will set the tone for the review and let the reader know that the movie left a negative impression. Introduction: \\"Disappointment: The Motion Picture\\" lives up to its title in delivering a cinematic experience that falls short of any reasonable expectations. With a tired and unimaginative plot, inadequate acting, and subpar production value, the film is a letdown on multiple levels. Step 4: Expand on key points To provide a well-rounded review, I will expand on the key points identified earlier, giving specific examples from the movie to support the negative sentiment. Weak and predictable plot: The story revolves around a group of friends who stumble upon a secret government experiment. The plot unravels with little suspense or intrigue, as the audience easily anticipates each twist and turn. The lack of originality fails to capture viewers' interest. Poor acting performances: The performances from the cast are unconvincing and amateurish, making it difficult to empathize with any of the characters. Their lack of chemistry is evident throughout, further highlighting the absence of emotional depth in the film. Ineffective directing: Sluggish pacing and poor scene construction prove to be the hallmark of this uninspired directorial effort. Transition shots and important plot points are often rushed, adding confusion and undermining the impact of key moments. Bad cinematography: The film's visual design leaves much to be desired. With unimaginative camera angles, bland lighting, and excessive use of shaky-cam, the movie's unappealing visual style detracts from the cinematic experience. Low production value: The visual effects are dated and underwhelming, often appearing cartoonish and unrealistic. The sound design is also of poor quality, making it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the film's world. Step 5: Write the conclusion To wrap up the review, I'll summarize my arguments and provide a final verdict on the film. Conclusion: In summary, \\"Disappointment: The Motion Picture\\" is an aptly-titled film that fails to deliver a compelling experience on nearly every level. Hindered by a weak plot, substandard acting, and lackluster production values, this is one cinema experience that is better off skipped. And there you have it, a movie review with a negative sentiment for the fictional film \\"Disappointment: The Motion Picture.\\""},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation. In 1996, after constructing two welfare reform bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich and his supporters pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 22, 1996. In his 1998 book Lessons Learned the Hard Way, Gingrich encouraged volunteerism and spiritual renewal, placing more importance on families, creating tax incentives and reducing regulations for businesses in poor neighborhoods, and increasing property ownership by low-income families. He also praised Habitat for Humanity for sparking the movement to improve people's lives by helping them build their own homes. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was Newt's involvement with the Welfare reform?","response":"Newt Gingrich was heavily involved in the welfare reform during his time as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Gingrich was instrumental in pushing for the reform and accused President Bill Clinton of stalling on welfare. He proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill in as little as 90 days and insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation. Gingrich played a significant role in the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act in 1996, which led to the major overhaul of the welfare system, giving state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery and reducing the federal government's responsibilities. After the passage of the Act, Gingrich continued to advocate for volunteerism, spiritual renewal, tax incentives for businesses in poor neighborhoods, and increasing property ownership by low-income families in his 1998 book, Lessons Learned the Hard Way."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in Italian, generate a new Italian sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991. - Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel or Vrangel (\\"Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Vrangel\\" April 25, 1928) was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later commanding general of the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Southern Russia in the later stages of the Russian Civil War. After his side lost the civil war in 1920, he left Russia and became one of the most prominent exiled White émigrés. - Alexander Pavlovich Rodzyanko ( Russian : ; 18 August 1879 -- 6 May 1970 ) was a lieutenant - general and a corps commander of the White Army during the Russian Civil War . - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. - The Crimean Peninsula (\\"Krymskiy poluostrov;\\" , \\"Kryms'ky pivostriv\\"), also known simply as Crimea ( \\"Krym\\" \\"Krym\\"), is a major land mass on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast. The peninsula is located south of the Ukrainian region of Kherson and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov. - The Green armies, Green Army (Russian: \\" \\"), or Greens (Russian: \\"\\") were armed peasant groups which fought against all governments in the Russian Civil War of 191722. They fought to protect their communities from requisitions or reprisals carried out by third parties. At times associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (by far the largest grouping of the Russian Constituent Assembly elected in 1917), the Green Armies had at least tacit support throughout much of Russia. However, the Green Armies' primary base, the peasantry, were largely reluctant to wage an active campaign during the Russian Civil War. Its strength during the civil war has been measured at 40,000 men. 'alexander rodzyanko' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?

Plot title: Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles Movie plot: In modern-day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who claims to be a vampire. Louis begins by describing his human life as a wealthy plantation owner in 1791 Spanish Louisiana. He had lost the will to live following the death of his wife and infant child; one night he is attacked by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) while drunkenly wandering the waterfront of New Orleans. Lestat senses Louis' dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire. Louis accepts and is transformed, but he rebels against killing humans, drinking animal blood to sustain himself. He is disgusted by Lestat's pleasure in killing and comes to suffer tremendously as a vampire. Louis finally succumbs to his hunger and kills his faithful house slave Yvette (Thandie Newton). Guilt-ridden, he tries to kill himself by setting fire to his house, but Lestat rescues him and they flee. Wandering the streets of New Orleans, amid an outbreak of plague, Louis finds an ill little girl in a house who has not realized her mother is dead.

She tricks him into drinking the blood of twin boys she killed by overdosing them with laudanum, knowing that blood from a corpse is fatal to vampires. This weakens him, and she slits his throat.

A:","response":"The Illusionist, also known as Eisenheim, whose real name is Eduard Abramovich, was last seen in Vienna, Austria-Hungary towards the end of the movie \\"The Illusionist,\\" directed by Neil Burger and released in 2006. In the film, he is a talented magician who becomes deeply involved in a political conspiracy involving Crown Prince Leopold. After years of being separated from his childhood love, Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen, Eisenheim reunites with her during one of his performances, when she is chosen by Crown Prince Leopold to participate in a trick. As their relationship rekindles, Eisenheim devises a plan to expose the Prince's corruption and abuse, and to ultimately spirit Sophie away from her forced engagement to Leopold. In a pivotal scene, Eisenheim seemingly conjures the spirit of Sophie during one of his magic shows, a blatant act of defiance against Leopold, who had forbidden any more illusions involving her after her alleged death. Chief Inspector Uhl, played by Paul Giamatti, receives orders to arrest Eisenheim for necromancy. However, upon arriving at the theater, Uhl finds no trace of Eisenheim. Later, Uhl discovers that Eisenheim planned everything meticulously, from enlisting the help of his crew to creating convincing illusions and using a body double for Sophie. It turns out that Sophie's death was also an illusion. In the film's final scenes, Uhl encounters Eisenheim in disguise at the train station. Eisenheim had been masquerading as an old man, blending with the crowd. Uhl follows Eisenheim and eventually confronts him, realizing that he had been deceived by the illusionist. However, rather than arresting Eisenheim, Uhl allows him to escape with Sophie, as they board a train together bound for an undisclosed location. The Illusionist, or Eisenheim, was last seen successfully evading capture by Chief Inspector Uhl, and boarding a train with Sophie.
