At the airport, the passengers and crew board United Airlines Flight 93 along with the hijackers. Shortly after boarding, Flight 93 runs into rush hour traffic, and the flight is momentarily delayed. The other 3 would-be-hijacked flights take off.Eventually Flight 93 does take off and passes by Manhattan. Hijacker Ziad Jarrah catches a final glimpse of the World Trade Center before the plane gets airborne.Air traffic controllers monitoring all current flights notice that American Airlines Flight 11 has taken a southern turn toward New York City. Not long after that, Flight 11 descends into Lower Manhattan and crashes head on into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, though air traffic controllers are not aware of it. CNN then broadcasts the first international shot of the smoking WTC. While the traffic controllers, unaware that Flight 11 has crashed, try to make sense of it, United Airlines Flight 175 begins to descend and turn toward NYC as well. Air traffic controllers then realize they are dealing with a hijacking. American Airlines Flight 77 is also hijacked. The traffic controllers alert the U.S. Air Force, who decide whether or not to shoot down all suspected hijacked flights.

In a raft Hypothesis: \\"A group of friends ride in a raft.\\" Key components: 1. A group of friends 2. Ride 3. In a raft Now, let's analyze the relationship between these key components: 1. The subject, \\"a group of friends,\\" is present in both the premise and the hypothesis. 2. The action, \\"ride,\\" is also present in both the premise and the hypothesis. 3. The most notable difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the presence of \\"the current\\" in the premise, which is absent from the hypothesis. 4. The location, \\"in a raft,\\" is present in both the premise and the hypothesis. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is generally entailed by the premise. The premise contains all the key components of the hypothesis while providing additional information, namely that the group of friends is riding the current. This additional detail of \\"the current\\" does not contradict or negate the hypothesis, as it is possible for a group of friends to ride in a raft both with and without the action of a current involved.

George's sheriff's officials accused in theft from union A grand jury charged two Prince George's County sheriff's officials Thursday with conspiring to steal more than 20,000 from the deputies' union when they were officers for the organization. The criminal indictment was brought by State Prosecutor Robert A. Rohrbaugh. According to the indictment, Wendy Tyler, who until Thursday was an acting sheriff's captain, served as president of the union that represents deputies from September 2005 to October 2007. Capt. Nancy Ridgely was first vice president of the union for the same term, the indictment says. During those two years, Tyler was entitled to receive quarterly checks totaling 10,400 from the Prince George's County Deputy Sheriff's Association, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #112, the indictment says. Tyler instead received 13 union checks for 22,124, the indictment says. The union requires the signature of two officers to draw checks on the union's bank account, according to the indictment. Ridgely signed 12 of the 13 checks paid to Tyler, the indictment says. Ridgely, who supervises the sheriff's department's public information office, did not return a phone call. Tyler, who had been working as an acting captain in the department's domestic violence unit, also did not return a phone call. William C. Brennan, Ridgely's attorney, said, \\"My client adamantly denies these allegations and will vigorously contest these charges.\\" Sheriff Michael Jackson, a candidate in the Democratic primary for county executive, did not return phone calls. Col. Paul A. Drula, Jackson's second-in-command, said, \\"As we've said before, it's a union issue involving union funds, not government funds. It's between union members.\\" Tyler and Ridgely will be placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the charges, Drula said. During her leave, Tyler will revert to the rank of lieutenant, Drula said. The indictment also accuses Tyler of making purchases of more than 10,000 for nonunion purposes with her union-issued credit card. The bills for those personal purchases were paid for with union funds, the indictment says.","response":"Two sheriff's officials in Prince George's County were accused of stealing over 20,000 from the deputies' union.

Next, let's calculate how many omelets Pauly can make by dividing the number of eggs (36) by the number of eggs required for each omelet (4). So, 36 / 4 = 9 omelets in total. 3. Now, we need to divide the total number of omelets (9) by the number of people in the family, which is 3 (including Pauly). Therefore, 9 omelets / 3 people = 3 omelets per person.

Expand this summary.","response":"Australian supermodel Elle Macpherson and her billionaire real estate developer husband Jeffrey Soffer have decided to end their marriage after nearly four years. The couple initially began dating in 2011 and had a two-year relationship before breaking up briefly in 2012. However, they soon rekindled their romance and tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Fiji in 2013. Macpherson, aged 53, also known as \\"The Body\\" in the world of fashion, has two teenage sons - Flynn, 19, and Cy, 14 - from her previous relationship with financier Arpad Busson. Soffer, on the other hand, has no children with Macpherson. As the couple navigates the process of separating their lives, sources close to them state that Macpherson has moved out of their luxurious Indian Creek home in Miami, taking her children with her. The supermodel is now reportedly looking for her own house in Miami to begin the next chapter of her life. As news of their split emerges, rumors have circulated suggesting that Jeffrey Soffer has been linked to other women. He has, however, denied these allegations, insisting that these relationships are purely platonic friendships. Notably, prior to his marriage to Macpherson, Soffer's name was linked with actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The end of Macpherson and Soffer's marriage marks a new phase in their lives, both personally and professionally. Now that they are parting ways, the couple will likely be focusing their energies on their individual pursuits. Macpherson, who has had a successful career as a model, actress, and businesswoman, is the founder and creative director of Elle Macpherson Body, a lingerie company. In addition, she has her own line of beauty products and wellness supplements. Meanwhile, Soffer will likely continue to focus on his work as a real estate developer, which has contributed significantly to his billion-dollar net worth. The reason behind their separation has not been disclosed, and the couple has not yet made any public statement regarding their split. Those close to the couple have indicated that the decision to part ways has been a difficult one, particularly given the time they have spent together and the many shared experiences they have had. As the two of them navigate this new chapter in their lives, it remains to be seen how they will balance their personal and professional lives in the midst of this significant change."},{"question":"Which of the following two sentences does not make sense?

The verb \\"wear\\" typically refers to putting on or having clothes or accessories on one's body. The object in this case is \\"a blue car\\". Cars are not worn and are not designed or intended to be worn on the body. - Sentence B: The subject, again, is \\"I\\". The verb \\"wear\\" remains consistent in its meaning. The object here is \\"a blue hat\\". Hats are designed to be worn on the head and are common accessories. Step 3: Compare plausibilities and determine the sentence that does not make sense: - Sentence A: Implausible because wearing a car on the head is not an action that makes logical or physical sense. - Sentence B: Plausible because wearing a hat on the head is a common, logical, and physically possible action.

Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing. and a hint : About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Please answer this question : Which mountain has a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information and hint, the White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks compared to Dome mountains. This is because the White mountains are characterized by the presence of caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena, which are primarily formed in limestone regions. As stated in the hint, about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones, and the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, where water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Since most cave systems are formed through limestone bedrock, it is evident that the White mountains would have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks in their composition. On the other hand, Dome mountains are described as being very massive, of volcanic origin, and excellent for climbing. The volcanic origin of Dome mountains points towards a predominantly igneous rock composition rather than sedimentary rocks. While it is possible that some sedimentary rocks may be present in certain Dome mountains, the overall percentage of sedimentary rocks in these mountains would be significantly less compared to the White mountains. In conclusion, the White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks in their composition due to factors such as the presence of cave systems, karst landscapes, and the fact that they are primarily formed in limestone regions. Dome mountains, with their volcanic origin, would have a lower percentage of sedimentary rocks in comparison."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a question, and your task is to predict the context of the question.

A contest for cartoons depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in... (Associated Press) The men drove up to the Curtis Culwell Center in the Dallas suburb of Garland as the event was scheduled to end and began shooting at the security officer, the City of Garland said in a statement. Garland police officers returned fire, killing the men. Garland police spokesman Joe Harn said it was not immediately clear whether the shooting was connected to the event inside, a contest hosted by the New York-based American Freedom Defense Initiative that would award 10,000 for the best cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad. But he said at a late Sunday news conference that authorities were searching the gunmen's vehicle for explosives, saying, \\"Because of the situation of what was going on today and the history of what we've been told has happened at other events like this, we are considering their car (is) possibly containing a bomb.\\" Drawings such at the ones featured at the Texas event are deemed insulting to many followers of Islam and have sparked violence around the world. According to mainstream Islamic tradition, any physical depiction of the Prophet Muhammad — even a respectful one — is considered blasphemous. The Curtis Culwell Center, a school-district owned public events space where the Texas event was held, was evacuated after the shooting, as were some surrounding businesses. The evacuation was lifted several hours later and police were not aware of any ongoing threat, but a large area around the center remained blocked off late into the night. Police helicopters circled overhead as bomb squads worked on the car. Harn said the bodies of the gunmen, who had not yet been identified, were not immediately taken from the scene because they were too close to the car. He said they would be removed once the car was cleared. The wounded security officer, who was unarmed, worked for the Garland Independent School District, Harn said. He was treated and released from a local hospital. Harn said the district hires security for events at its facilities, but noted additional security also was in place for Sunday's event. The sponsoring group has said it paid 10,000 for off-duty police officers and other private security. Harn said the city had not received any credible threats before the shooting. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said state officials are investigating, and Dallas FBI spokeswoman Katherine Chaumont said that agency is providing investigative and bomb technician assistance. The event featured speeches by American Freedom Defense Initiative president Pamela Geller and Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker known for his outspoken criticism of Islam. Wilders received several standing ovations from the crowd and left immediately after his speech. Wilders, who has advocated closing Dutch doors to migrants from the Islamic world for a decade, has lived under round-the-clock police protection since 2004. After the shooting, authorities escorted about 75 contest attendees to another room in the conference center, where a woman held up an American flag, and the crowd sang \\"God Bless America.\\" The group was then taken to a separate location, where they were held for about two hours until being briefly questioned by FBI agents before being released. Johnny Roby of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who was attending the contest, told the Associated Press he was outside the building when he heard around about 20 shots that appeared to be coming from the direction of a passing car. Roby said he then heard two single shots. He said he heard officers yell that they had the car before he was sent inside the building. Geller told the AP before Sunday's event that she planned the contest to make a stand for free speech in response to outcries and violence over drawings of Muhammad. She said in a statement issued Sunday night that the shooting showed how \\"needed our event really was.\\" In January, 12 people were killed by gunmen in an attack against the Paris office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which had lampooned Islam and other religions and used depictions of Muhammad. Another deadly shooting occurred the following month at a free speech event in Copenhagen featuring an artist who had caricatured the prophet. Tens of thousands of people rallied around the world to honor the victims and defend the freedom of expression following those shootings. Geller's group is known for mounting a campaign against the building of an Islamic center blocks from the World Trade Center site and for buying advertising space in cities across the U.S. criticizing Islam. When a Chicago-based nonprofit held a January fundraiser in Garland designed to help Muslims combat negative depictions of their faith, Geller spearheaded about 1,000 picketers at the event. One chanted: \\"Go back to your own countries! We don't want you here!\\" Others held signs with messages such as, \\"Insult those who behead others,\\" an apparent reference to recent beheadings by the militant group Islamic State. ||||| Officer Joe Harn addresses the media. (Photo: WFAA) GARLAND — Police in Garland say they believe the two men killed outside a controversial art show Sunday night were there to shoot the approximately 200 people attending the event before a traffic officer intervened. The suspects were identified as Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi of Phoenix. The American Freedom Defense Initiative was hosting the Muhammad Art Exhibit inside the Curtis Culwell Center Sunday. The event featured a contest for cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad and was almost over when the incident occurred. Garland police spokesman Officer Joe Harn said at a 10 a.m. news conference Monday that security had been ramped up for the controversial event, and a plan had been in place involving the FBI for months. Organizers of the event paid 10,000 to have extra officers on hand. Team coverage on the Garland shooting incident According to Harn, the two suspects pulled up to the event in a car, immediately got out with assault rifles and began shooting at a police car that was parked next to a barricade. Garland Independent School District police Officer Bruce Joiner was hit, but suffered non-life threatening injuries. Harn said a single police officer initially subdued Simpson and Soofi, but that after his initial shots, SWAT officers also opened fire, killing both men outside their car. He said it was not clear yet who fired the fatal shots. Attendees of the event were rushed inside the Culwell Center after gunfire was heard. People in a secure room at the center sang patriotic songs. Harn said investigators spent the night searching the suspects' vehicle for bombs or explosives. None were found, but they detonated the vehicle for safety's sake. Harn said luggage was found inside the vehicle, but it wasn't clear when the suspects arrived in North Texas. Both suspects' bodies remained at the scene until about 11 a.m. Monday, with dozens of shell casings surrounding them. Both were wearing heavy-duty tactical vests. One had a New York Yankees cap next to him. The suspects' car was finally towed away around 6 p.m. Monday. The site outside the Curtis Culwell Center remained an active crime scene, Harn said. The vehicles of the nearly 200 people attending the art show were still at the scene. The attendees were bussed away from the event via Garland ISD school buses on Sunday night. A 1,000-foot radius around the Walmart nearby was initially shut down and multiple businesses in the area were evacuated. The perimeter has since been lifted. Advanced placement testing scheduled for Monday at the Culwell Center was canceled, according to Garland ISD, but school was in session Monday morning for a high school nearby. Plano, Irving, DPS, FBI and ATF are assisting Garland police with their investigation, Harn said. Buck Revell, a former head of the Dallas FBI office, praised Garland's handling of the situation. \\"Garland did a terrific job,\\" said Revell, a terrorism expert. \\"Obviously, they were concerned, because there rumblings on the Internet about 'It's time for the brothers to come out and show these people they can't say anything about the Prophet or about Islam.'\\" Revell, like many others, says this won't be the first nor the last attempt of those trying to violently stifle free speech. He rejected the criticism of those who say the Garland school district shouldn't have allowed the use of its facility for the event. \\"If you can't host an effort where there's going to be open speech and debate about controversial issues, then we've already lost our freedom,\\" he said. \\"They've won without having to put forward their agenda on a legitimate basis, much less on an illegitimate and violent basis.\\" FBI agents on Monday searched an apartment in Phoenix where they say the suspects lived as roommates. \\"The two gunmen who were involved in the shooting in Dallas... were determined to be from Phoenix, located at this property,\\" Assistant Special Agent in Charge John Lannarelli told WFAA's sister station KPNX. \\"Hence the FBI and Phoenix police were involved in determining where at this location and what evidence may be available that can be used in the Dallas investigation.\\" One of the suspects has been identified as Nadir Soofi. The other, identified as Elton Simpson, 30, was previously convicted in a terror investigation but received probation. Dunston Simpson, Elton's father, told ABC News that his son \\"made a bad choice.\\" \\"We are Americans and we believe in America,\\" he said. \\"What my son did reflects very badly on my family.\\" READ MORE: Garland suspect had history with FBI counterterror unit Elton Simpson is also believed to be the man who tweeted several ominous messages before the incident Sunday, using the hashtag #texasattack. Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative and organizer of the art show, referred to it as a \\"free speech event\\" on Twitter. One tweet from her after the apparent attack read \\"this is a war.\\" Governor Greg Abbott released the following statement on Monday: \\"This morning I called Mayor Athas to offer any state resources and assistance that would aid his city following this heinous attack, and praised the City of Garland's swift and effective action to stop these gunmen and protect innocent lives. I also received a briefing from the Department of Public Safety on the latest developments regarding the actions and motivations of the shooters. I instructed Director McCraw to work with federal authorities to fully investigate the assailants' ties to organized terrorist activity, and received assurances that DPS will continue to communicate with my office and the public as additional information can be released.\\" Dr. Nasim Rehmatullah, National Vice President of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA, also released a statement: \\"Violence is never an acceptable response to hate speech, no matter how inflammatory and uncivilized that speech is. While we do not yet know what motivated these shooters, we urge calm and defer to local, state, and federal authorities to peaceably and justly resolve this.\\" ABC News says ISIS followers were calling for attacks leading up to the Garland event. \\"The brothers from the Charlie Hebdo attack did their part. It's time for brothers in the US to do their part,\\" one supporter wrote. \\"Brothers in Garland Texas Please go to there with your weapons, bombs or with your knives.

FBI agents have searched the apartment the two men shared in Phoenix. The president of a Phoenix mosque said Soofi and Simpson used to attend but hadn’t lately. A news conference scheduled for 3:30 p.m. was canceled shortly after 2:30. Police say they have nothing new to report. A quick-thinking Garland police officer shot and killed two gunmen who opened fire at a controversial art exhibit featuring cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, police said Monday. Police say the two gunmen were armed with assault rifles and wearing body armor when they pulled up to the Curtis Culwell Center shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday. They began shooting almost immediately and wounded an unarmed Garland ISD security guard who was with the officer. The officer returned fire and killed the gunmen. \\"Under the fire that he was put under, he did a very good job and probably saved lives,\\" said police spokesman Joe Harn. “We had a SWAT react team in the back that very quickly responded within seconds and helped secure the scene.” The officer’s name hasn’t been released. The security officer, Bruce Joiner, 58, was treated at a hospital for an ankle wound and released. He is a former Rowlett police officer. Authorities were investigating whether the shooting was a terrorist attack. \\"This is not going to be a real fast investigation,” Harn said Monday. For hours overnight, a bomb squad investigated whether explosives might be in the car the two suspects drove up in. They found suitcases and additional ammunition, but no bombs. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he has received a briefing about the incident from the Texas Department of Public Safety, which is working with federal authorities on the investigation. Abbott said he called Garland Mayor Douglas Athas and offered any state resources and help. One of the gunmen killed Sunday has been identified as an Arizona man who was the subject of a jihadist terrorism investigation. A senior FBI official confirmed one shooter was Elton Simpson, 31, whose Phoenix apartment was being searched by federal agents Monday morning, according to ABC News. The second shooter was identified as Nadir Soofi, 34, according to The Washington Post. The shooters were roommates, according to reports. Who instigated the plan remains to be seen, The Post said, but the FBI had no reason to believe an international terror group directed the attack. Five years ago Simpson was convicted for lying to federal agents about talking about traveling to Somalia in 2009 to engage in “violent jihad.” Simpson talked about “the obligation to fight jihad overseas” in conversations the FBI taped, court records show. In 2010, when the FBI questioned him at his home in Avondale, Ariz., Simpson had a plane ticket to travel to South Africa as well as his passport. Authorities believe Simpson was also behind Twitter messages sent shortly before the Sunday attack that included the hashtag \\"#texasattack.\\" “May Allah accept us as mujahideen [those engaged in jihad],” the tweet said. His father, Dunston Simpson, told ABC News on Monday that his son \\"made a bad choice.\\" \\"We are Americans and we believe in America. What my son did reflects very badly on my family,\\" Simpson told ABC News. Neighbors in the Phoenix apartment complex where Soofi and Simpson lived said they never saw anything out of the ordinary from them. A woman said she had a few interactions with one of the men, who she said smoked marijuana. Soofi was convicted of a misdemeanor marijuana possession last month, according to Arizona court records. \\"I was never threatened by him. He seemed pleasant,\\" said the woman who asked not be identified because of the nature of the investigation. Another neighbor, Tim Rains, said one of the men helped him from his car after he had trouble breathing a year ago. \\"He came right up and offered to help,\\" Rains said. Soofi and Simpson once attended the Islamic Center of Phoenix but stopped coming recently, said Usama Shami, president of the mosque about 15 minutes north of downtown. Shami said he met Simpson 10 years ago at a time when it was suspected that an FBI informant was a member of the mosque. Federal court documents confirm that the FBI used a confidential informant in 2006 to help build the government's case against Simpson. Shami said the mosque doesn’t encourage violence and said the men’s possible radicalization would have been corrected had they stayed. “If you look at people who have been radicalized, they haven’t been radicalized in the mosque,” Shami said Monday at the mosque, which is about 15 minutes north of downtown Phoenix. Sunday's controversial event included an art show of Muhammad caricatures, which many Muslims consider offensive. The event was hosted by Pam Geller, whose group, the American Freedom Defense Initiative, is considered an anti-Muslim organization. The group offered a cash award for best drawing and defended the event as their freedom of expression. The organization said it spent 10,000 on extra security. The White House on Monday condemned the shooting but stopped short of criticizing the event. “We have seen extremists try to use expressions that they considered to be offensive as a way to justify violence not only in this country but around the world,\\" press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One. \\"In the mind of the president there is no form of expression that would justify an act of violence.” Two prominent Muslim imams in the Dallas area on Monday denounced the violence in Garland and called on community members \\"not to be baited\\" into anger by events like the \\"Muhammad Art Exhibit.\\" “As a Muslim community we need to acknowledge hate groups and not get baited,” said Imam Zia ul-Haque Sheikh, the leader of one of North Texas’ largest mosques. “They are trying to provoke the Muslims into doing something wrong.” Imam Zia, who leads the Islamic Center of Irving, added, “The public really needs to know that we stayed away from the event and did not give it publicity.” Police and federal authorities were still sifting through evidence on Monday outside the Culwell Center. For hours after the shooting, authorities kept the estimated 200 people there inside. They were eventually evacuated and taken to a secure location for questioning. Their cars remained at the center on Monday, as was the vehicle belonging to the suspects. The trunk of their car was opened like a tin can after a police bomb squad used explosives to get inside. \\"There were several detonations of things that we were finding,\\" Harn said Monday. \\"One of the first detonations you heard was to open the trunk of the vehicle.\\" Jim Harman, who was inside the center, said that police kept attendees calm when the shooting began. He said security guards quickly escorted Geller from the stage. “We knew something had happened, but we didn’t hear anything and didn’t see anything,” he said. Before the shootings, Geller dismissed critics who called her American Freedom Defense Initiative an extremist organization. “As if pursuing good in the extreme makes it a bad thing,” she said, adding that the shooting Sunday showed how “needed our event really was.” Staff writers Claire Z. Cardona, Julie Fancher, Naomi Martin, Robert Wilonsky, Kevin Krause, Tasha Tsiaperas and Matthew Haag and the Arizona Republic and The Associated Press contributed to this report. Judge's Ruling in Elton Simpson Case Elton Simpson Indictment ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police have spent several hours inspecting the gunmen's car for explosives Two gunmen have been shot dead after opening fire outside a conference on cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a suburb of Dallas, US police say. They drove to the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland as the event was ending, and began shooting at a security officer before being killed by police. The bomb squad has been called in to search their vehicle for explosives. The event, organised by a group critical of Islam, included a contest for drawings of the Prophet. One of the keynote speakers was the Dutch politician Geert Wilders, an outspoken critic of Islam in Western societies. Security had been tight, but Garland police said there had been no credible threats in advance, and it was not immediately clear if the shootings were related to the event. ABC news reported that one of the suspects had been identified as Elton Simpson, an Arizona man who had been previously investigated on suspicion of terrorism offences. Officials believe that he sent several Twitter messages before the Sunday's shooting, including one with the hashtag #texasattack. The Twitter account was later suspended. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Eyewitness Stephen Perkins: ''Security was very tight'' About 200 people had been attending the Muhammad Art Exhibit when, shortly before it was due to finish at 19:00 (00:00 GMT), they were told of a shooting outside. One woman at the conference was leaving the building when she said she heard \\"quick shots\\" from what she thought was a machine gun. \\"Police started running everywhere, they quickly told us to run as fast as we could to get back in the building,\\" she said. They and people from nearby buildings were later evacuated. The \\"first suspect was shot immediately,\\" Garland Mayor Douglas Athas told CNN. \\"The second suspect was wounded and reached for his backpack. He was shot again.\\" Security officer Bruce Joiner was taken to hospital after being shot in the ankle, but was later released. Local police said earlier that they had not been yet able to identify the gunmen, whose bodies remained by the car while bomb experts inspected it for explosives. Joe Harn, a spokesman for the Garland Police Department, warned that the inspection is \\"a very slow, tedious operation that goes on\\".

The conference included a contest that offered a 10,000 (£6,600) prize for a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad. The Curtis Culwell Center - a school-district owned building for public events - was at the centre of controversy in January, after it was picketed by hundreds of protesters angry that it was hosting an event to raise funds for the building of a local Islamic centre. Mayor Athas acknowledged there had been a lot of local concern about Sunday's event \\"which is why we had heightened security in the area\\". Ms Geller said she was standing up for free speech, adding: \\"This terrible incident reflects the need for such conferences.\\" \\"We are continually abridging our freedoms so as not to offend savages,\\" she said. Geller denied she was anti-Muslim, only \\"anti-jihad\\". In a text message to Dutch media, Geert Wilders said Sunday's incident had been an \\"unacceptable\\" attack on freedom of expression. \\"The only fitting response is: to carry on. But it's not easy,\\" he told Dutch public broadcaster NOS. Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are offensive to many Muslims. There were widespread protests in 2006 when the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published cartoons satirising the Prophet Muhammad. In January this year, 12 people were murdered by two Islamist gunmen at the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had published similar cartoons. And a gathering of free speech activists in the Danish capital Copenhagen was targeted by a gunman in February, killing a film director.

As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems, from Japan to Quebec.

The Connecticut WFP helped elect Congressman Jim Himes by defeating Republican Congressman Chris Shays . The Connecticut WFP helped elect congressman Jim Himes , defeating long-term Republican congressman Chris Shays .","response":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia convey similar information, they are not exactly the same in meaning. Let's analyze each sentence closely to understand their differences. 1. The Connecticut WFP helped elect Congressman Jim Himes by defeating Republican Congressman Chris Shays. This sentence primarily focuses on the victory of Congressman Jim Himes and the role Connecticut WFP played in his election. It mentions that the Connecticut WFP (Working Families Party) contributed to Himes' victory by defeating Republican Congressman Chris Shays. Here, the sentence structure suggests that the victory of Jim Himes was a direct result of the defeat of Chris Shays, with \\"by\\" acting as a connector between the two actions. 2. The Connecticut WFP helped elect congressman Jim Himes, defeating long-term Republican congressman Chris Shays. In this sentence, although the central idea remains the same – that the Connecticut WFP played a role in the election of Congressman Jim Himes – the focus shifts slightly to emphasize the defeat of Chris Shays. The use of the comma creates a pause, separate from the main clause. Consequently, this sentence structure highlights the defeat of the \\"long-term\\" Republican congressman Chris Shays. The mention of him being \\"long-term\\" adds an element of significance to his defeat and increases the impact of the Connecticut WFP contribution. In conclusion, both sentences convey that the Connecticut WFP played a role in electing Congressman Jim Himes by defeating Chris Shays. However, the first sentence focuses more on Himes' victory as the direct result of the Shays' defeat, while the second sentence emphasizes the importance of Shays' loss, mentioning him as a long-term congressman."},{"question":"Review: is hereby given fair warning .

How many Umpires are there in a game of Baseball?","response":"To answer this question, I will first gather information about the game of Baseball and the role of umpires. Baseball is a game played between two opposing teams, each consisting of nine players, who take turns batting and fielding. The game comprises nine innings and is regulated by a set of rules. Umpires are crucial officials in a baseball game responsible for making decisions on plays and ensuring that both teams adhere to the rules. They interpret and enforce the rules, make judgment calls on close plays, and keep track of balls, strikes, and outs. Now, I will find out the typical number of umpires in a baseball game. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a crew of four umpires typically officiates each game. One umpire is stationed behind home plate, while the other three umpires are positioned near first base, second base, and third base. However, in lower levels of the sport or in amateur games, the number of umpires might differ, depending on the available resources and the level of competition. It's not uncommon to see two or sometimes even one umpire officiating in these situations. To conclude, I would say that there are typically four umpires in a Major League Baseball game, but the number can vary depending on the level of the competition and available resources."},{"question":"Wir sagen Ja zu einer Reform, zu einer Reform, die die Ungleichgewichte zwischen den Staaten, den Regionen und den Bauern verringert, zu einer Reform, die zu einer ökologischen Entwicklung der ländlichen Regionen beiträgt, zu einer Reform, die der Agrarbevölkerung in unseren Ländern hilft.

How does photosynthesis compare to cellular respiration? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose your answer from: -no. -yes.","response":"Yes, the questions have the same meaning. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are vital processes for most organisms on Earth. Despite being seemingly opposite in nature, these two processes share a few similarities and many differences. Let's explore the similarities and differences between photosynthesis and cellular respiration in detail. Similarities: 1. Both involve the exchange of gases: In both processes, gases are involved as reactants and products. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. In contrast, cellular respiration consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. 2. Biochemical pathways: Both processes involve complex biochemical pathways. Photosynthesis mainly consists of light-dependent reactions (where energy from sunlight is captured) and the Calvin cycle (the synthesis of organic molecules). Cellular respiration includes glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain, all of which break down organic molecules to release energy. 3. Role of ATP: Both processes involve the production or consumption of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of cells. Photosynthesis generates ATP to store energy in glucose molecules. In cellular respiration, breaking down glucose releases stored energy in the form of ATP. 4. Presence of electron transport chain: Both photosynthesis and cellular respiration involve an electron transport chain, a series of protein complexes within a membrane. This chain facilitates the transfer of electrons, enabling the conversion of sunlight or energy stored in glucose into ATP. Differences: 1. Location in the cell: Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, organelles found in plant cells containing chlorophyll pigments. Cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria of almost all eukaryotic organisms (plants, animals, fungi, and protists). 2. Energy source: Photosynthesis is an anabolic process that uses sunlight as the primary energy source to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen. Cellular respiration is a catabolic process that breaks down glucose using oxygen, releasing energy in the form of ATP, water, and carbon dioxide. 3. Energy conversion: Photosynthesis is an endergonic process that stores energy in glucose molecules, while cellular respiration is an exergonic process that releases energy from glucose molecules. 4. Necessity of sunlight: Photosynthesis requires sunlight as the primary energy source. In contrast, cellular respiration can occur in the presence or absence of light, as long as glucose and oxygen are available. 5. Types of organisms: Photosynthesis occurs only in photoautotrophic organisms like plants, algae, and some bacteria, which can synthesize their own food. Cellular respiration occurs in nearly all living organisms, including autotrophs that produce their own food and heterotrophs that consume other organisms for energy. In summary, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two essential physiological processes with many similarities and differences. Both involve exchanging gases, biochemical pathways, and the use of ATP. They also both utilize electron transport chains in their processes. However, they differ in their location, energy source, energy conversion processes, dependence on sunlight, and the types of organisms in which they occur."},{"question":"Premise: \\"5 female soccer players wearing green uniforms.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Huddled on a field with their yellow-clad coach.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Assuming that: An object with greater mass or greater velocity has more kinetic energy. Answer:","response":"An object with large kinetic energy can be either small or large, depending on various factors such as mass and velocity. Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion, and it is determined by the equation: Kinetic Energy (KE) = 0.5 × Mass (m) × Velocity^2 (v^2) From this equation, it is clear that both mass and velocity play a crucial role in determining the kinetic energy of an object. An object with greater mass or greater velocity has higher kinetic energy. However, the relationship between mass, velocity, and kinetic energy is not straightforward and depends on the interplay of the two contributing factors. Now, let's analyze the cases of small and large objects with large kinetic energy: 1. Large object with large kinetic energy: For a larger object, its mass is usually greater, and so is its inertia, the property that resists changes in its motion. When a force is applied to a large object, it may require more work to change its motion and therefore more energy would be transferred, increasing the object's kinetic energy. If this large object also happens to be moving with a high velocity, it will have even greater kinetic energy. 2. Small object with large kinetic energy: A small object can have a large kinetic energy if it has a high velocity. Even though the smaller object has a lesser mass than the larger object, the square of the velocity in the kinetic energy equation can compensate for this lower mass. For instance, bullets and other high-speed projectiles may be small in mass, but their high velocities give them large kinetic energies. In conclusion, an object with large kinetic energy can be either small or large depending on the combination of mass and velocity. If a large object has sufficient velocity, it will have large kinetic energy. On the other hand, a small object can also possess large kinetic energy if it has a very high velocity. The ultimate determining factors behind an object's kinetic energy are the mass of the object and the square of its velocity, as illustrated in the equation mentioned earlier."},{"question":"Question: Title: Lost suction after one month Review: I have a friend who has had a great expeerience with this vacuum so I purchased one.

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits Context: Crowded House were midway through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994. He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family. Wally Ingram, drummer for support act Sheryl Crow, temporarily filled in until a replacement, Peter Jones (ex-Harem Scarem, Vince Jones, Kate Ceberano's Septet) was found. After the tour, the Finn Brothers released their album Finn in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album Recurring Dream, Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances. Recurring Dream contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were \\"Instinct\\", \\"Not the Girl You Think You Are\\" and \\"Everything Is Good for You\\", which featured backing vocals from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks. Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the Farewell to the World concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the Sydney Children's Hospital. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were Custard, Powderfinger and You Am I. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people. Farewell to the World was released on VHS in December 1996. In 2007, a double CD and a DVD were issued as to commemorate the concert's tenth anniversary. The DVD featured newly recorded audio commentary by Finn, Hart and Seymour and other new bonus material. Question: Why did Paul decide to quit?.

Choices: - organ body - simple body - retinal body - cell body A:","response":"The cell body, also known as the soma, is the part of a neuron that contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. As the main structural and functional component, the cell body plays a critical role in the overall function and maintenance of the neuron. In this response, we'll take an in-depth look at the cell body, its contents, and its functions. The primary function of the cell body is to maintain the neuron's cellular components, which are necessary for its normal functioning and survival. Within the cell body, several crucial organelles and structures serve different functions. Some of these key components include: 1. Nucleus: The nucleus is a vital organelle within the cell body that contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls the synthesis of proteins and other molecules required for the neuron's functioning. The nucleus also plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and maintaining the overall health of the neuron. 2. Mitochondria: Often referred to as the \\"powerhouse\\" of the cell, mitochondria are responsible for generating energy for the neuron through the process of cellular respiration. They convert glucose (sugar) and oxygen into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides the energy necessary for various cellular processes and functions. 3. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): This organelle is a network of membranous tubules and sacs that synthesizes, processes, and transports proteins, lipids, and other vital molecules within the neuron. The ER is divided into two types – the rough ER, which is covered in ribosomes and plays a role in protein synthesis, and the smooth ER, which does not contain ribosomes and is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification processes. 4. Golgi Apparatus: The Golgi apparatus is a series of flattened membranous sacs that further process, modify, and package proteins and lipids produced by the ER. These proteins and lipids are then transported to other parts of the neuron or secreted outside the cell. 5. Cytoplasm: The cytoplasm is the gel-like substance that fills the cell body, providing a supportive environment for organelles and various cellular processes. It contains a wide variety of enzymes, ions, and other molecules involved in metabolism, waste processing, and organelle support. 6. Cytoskeleton: The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments that gives the cell shape, support, and mechanical strength while also contributing to intracellular organelle movement. It is composed of three major components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. The cell body is also responsible for receiving and integrating information from other neurons via synapses – specialized connections between neurons. Dendrites, which are branched extensions of the cell body, receive signals from other neurons and transmit this information to the cell body for processing. This information is then passed on to the axon, the elongated extension that transmits electrical signals called action potentials to other neurons or target cells, such as muscles or glands. In summary, the cell body of a neuron contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles required for the neuron's proper functioning, including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and cytoskeleton. The cell body plays an essential role in maintaining the neuron's health, synthesizing proteins and other molecules, processing and transmitting information, and providing structural support."},{"question":"Ursula: That was a huge fire in California!

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis involving less coal being put into a coal-fired steam station would not have a direct effect on forest formation, as the processes of tree reproduction and seed dispersal are independent of this factor. However, there could be indirect effects. Burning less coal in the coal-fired steam station would lead to a decrease in the emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. This reduction in pollution could have several potential indirect effects on forest formation: 1. Improved air quality: With less air pollution, the overall health and resilience of trees and forests may improve, allowing them to grow better and spread their seeds more effectively. This could contribute to an increase in forest formation over time. 2. Reduced climate change impacts: Greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming, which can adversely affect forest ecosystems through altered rainfall patterns, increased frequency of forest fires, and shifts in plant and animal species distributions. By reducing the burning of coal, the impacts of climate change on forests may be lessened to some extent, potentially fostering more favorable conditions for forest expansion and formation. 3. Acid rain mitigation: Burning coal releases sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which can contribute to the formation of acid rain. Acid rain can damage forests, affecting the growth of trees and soil fertility. If less coal is burned, there may be a decrease in acid rain, creating a more conducive environment for forest formation. 4. Positive public perception: A decrease in coal burning may lead to an increased awareness and appreciation for environmental conservation, indirectly promoting efforts to protect and restore forests and natural habitats. In summary, while the perturbation of less coal burning in a coal-fired steam station does not have a direct effect on forest formation, it could potentially lead to several indirect positive consequences for forest ecosystems. This may ultimately result in a more favorable environment for the growth and reproduction of trees, promoting greater forest formation over time."},{"question":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Or they can just hire Captain America and Spider-Man. Marvel Entertainment has for decades quietly housed a small group focused on helping brands produce custom comics featuring the likes of revered characters like Captain America, Iron Man and the Hulk. The expanding Marvel Custom Solutions unit also helps marketers revamp their own characters, or occasionally weave their messages into existing Marvel comics, movies and TV shows. But ever since the original “Avengers” movie was released in 2012, executives at Marvel say a wider variety of advertisers are coming to them to create marketing programs–not just brands that are tied to each movie release. In fact, Marvel has helped produce custom content for a slew of brands you might not expect, ranging from Kiehl’s to Western Union, Lexus, Popsicle and Benefits Cosmetics. This year, the Walt Disney Co.-owned-firm has entered into a unique marketing partnership with Adobe, which will culminate at Comic-Con in San Diego later this week. As part of the “Make It With Creative Cloud” campaign, four students were selected from thousands of entrants to come up with original comics in conjunction with Marvel artists using the Marvel characters Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Iron Man–all created using Adobe’s Creative Cloud software. The four lucky winners will present their work at Comic-Con, where Marvel will hand out 10,000 copies of each comic creation to attendees. Not only does Adobe get to provide these aspiring artists with a Marvel-branded comic (which should help these students impress many hiring managers when they look to get jobs), but the software giant also gets to present itself as a supporter of young creative talent while drafting off of Marvel’s cool factor. “Marvel is such a relevant brand to young people,” said Sasha Braude, Adobe’s senior director of campaign marketing. “We can say this is the first Marvel comic powered by the cloud.” The Comic-Con campaign for Adobe is the latest such endeavor by Marvel as it looks to broaden its suite of offerings for marketers. Of course, Marvel’s parent company Disney is perhaps the gold standard when it comes to extracting every dollar from its entertainment franchises and characters. For example, the media giant is in the midst of introducing theme parks inspired by the animated smash hit “Frozen” in markets all over the world. Disney doesn’t break out revenue for the Marvel Custom Solutions group. “They either want our equity to speak to their consumers because we are more relatable, or they want to speak to our audience,” said Dan Buckley, Marvel’s president of TV, publishing and brand management, referring to what draws marketers to the 12-person Marvel Custom Solutions team. “That’s what makes us kind of a niche agency.” Mr. Buckley was quick to point out that Marvel works with many ad agencies, including MRY in case of the Adobe deal. But the comic publisher offers something few other creative agencies can boast of: access to the artists and writers who actually work on comics featuring some of the most popular characters on the globe. “Why would you go to another agency to help you use Spider-Man?” Mr. Buckley asked. “We know how to do that, and it will get done in half the time.” Marvel isn’t alone in producing custom comic books and other content for brands. Rival DC Comics has helped marketers like General Mills redesign characters for the company’s Monsters Cereals brand through its DC Entertainment Sales Team. That group has also produced limited edition comics for TNT featuring the hosts of the show “Inside the NBA” interacting with members of the Justice League like Superman and Wonder Woman. Like Marvel, DC Comics tasks the same artists and writers who work on its top titles to work on comic projects funded by brands. Marvel’s in-house brand group has been at it since the 1970s. For years, the under-the-radar unit mostly produced custom comics for retailers selling Marvel DVDs. But when DVD sales started to wane a few years ago, “we had to reinvent ourselves,” said Mr. Buckley. Thankfully, starting in 2008 with “Iron Man“–the first movie released by Marvel’s brand new movie studio–the company began a streak of releasing annual hits, meaning that plenty of movie advertisers were looking for complementary comic work. But according to Mr. Buckley, over the past couple of years, Marvel has seen lots of non-movie advertisers come to the custom solutions group looking for multi-channel marketing efforts like custom comics, digital ads and original animation. “We think we have something that is culturally relevant,” said Jonathan Rheingold, vice president of ad sales and Marvel Custom Solutions. Mr. Rheingold came to Marvel a few years ago after working in consumer magazines for years. “I think with Marvel…we can really say it’s a lifestyle like what MTV was in the 1980s and ’90s. I’m not sure if we could say that 10 years ago.” Indeed, when you can boast of a brand that seemingly can’t miss at the box office, lots of advertisers are likely to look to glom on. And one thing Messrs Buckley and Rheingold emphasize is that Marvel’s characters appeal to multiple generations and demographics, giving them license to talk to a range of marketers. Take Kiehl’s, the skin-care brand that tapped Marvel in 2013 for a custom content program themed around “Captain America.” The deal included a comic that tied the character’s origin stories, which date back to the 1940s, to Kiehl’s history as a brand. “I love how comics inspire your imagination,” said Chris Salgardo, president of Kiehl’s USA. “That’s what we wanted to do when we partnered with Marvel–inspire their readers to learn more about Kiehl’s own 164-year-old story.” Or look at the female-oriented Benefits Cosmetics, which rather than task Marvel with creating a custom comic featuring members of the Avengers, asked the company’s storytellers in 2012 to “Marvelize” their existing character Spy Gal. Then there’s Kimberly-Clark 's GoodNites, a product aimed at helping young children cope with bed-wetting. Melanie Huet, the director of child care for Kimberly-Clark, said that GoodNites had been licensing Marvel characters for its kids pull-ups for a few years when the two companies started exploring how they could work more closely together. As Ms. Huet explained, Kimberly-Clark’s research shows that one-sixth of kids experience bed-wetting at some point. Yet these kids are hard to reach in traditional media, not to mention that it’s difficult to deliver the message in an ad that bed-wetting is O.K. But if Spider-Man, a character with his own secret identity, tells kids that bed-wetting is normal and nothing to worry about, it resonates, she said. “It was something new and different for us to turn our brand over to someone else like Marvel,” she said. But as a result of the campaign last year, GoodNites saw its sales triple on Amazon versus the previous year. “It became one of our strongest pieces of marketing.” After all, who’s more inspiring than Spider-Man? ______________________________________________________ For the latest media, marketing and advertising news, follow us on Twitter: follow @wsjCMO Subscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox.

Mutations result from errors during DNA replication or other types of damage to DNA, which then may undergo error-prone repair (especially microhomology-mediated end joining), or cause an error during other forms of repair, or else may cause an error during replication (translesion synthesis). Mutations may also result from insertion or deletion of segments of DNA due to mobile genetic elements. Mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes including: evolution, cancer, and the development of the immune system, including junctional diversity. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

With 98% of the precincts reporting, it could not clear early Wednesday whether de Blasio had won the Democratic nomination — or whether Thompson had corraled just enough support to force a runoff in three weeks. And it could be a week or even more before the final vote count is decided. The latest tally showed de Blasio had 40.2% of the vote, just a whisker more than the 40% needed to win the nomination without a runoff. Thompson had 26%. But with tens of thousands of votes outstanding — including 19,000 paper ballots — it appeared that it would take the city’s embattled Board of Elections days, if not a week, to sort it all out. Introduced by his 16-year-old son, Dante, and 19-year-old daughter, Chiara, who had been showcased throughout his campaign, de Blasio took the stage at his raucous victory party at the Bell House in Gowanus, Brooklyn, as if the Democratic nomination had been settled.

Three more weeks!” PHOTOS: NEW YORK CITY PRIMARY DAY 2013: CANDIDATES CAST THEIR BALLOTS A runoff, if necessary, would be held Oct. 1. “I’m confident,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens), a Thompson backer. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn had 15.5%, Controller John Liu had 7% and scandal-scarred former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner had 4.9% — all finishing far out of the money. Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee will face Republican Joe Lhota in November for the right to lead the city after 12 years of Mayor Bloomberg’s reign. Lhota, a former MTA chairman and deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani, outdistanced billionaire John Catsimatidis Tuesday for the Republican nomination.

De Blasio kept up his anti-Bloomberg rhetoric to the end, saying he represents a clear change in direction for the city from a mayor who is “out of touch with the people’s wishes.” “I present the most progressive view for this city, and I think the choice is clear in the Democratic primary,” de Blasio told cheering supporters. “He is going to win,” said voter Paulette White, 47. “Everyone in Park Slope is voting for you, Bill.” RELATED: DANTE DE BLASIO'S CLASSMATES IGNORE HIS LOCAL CELEB STATUS By the time the polls closed at 9 p.m., the Edison Research exit poll showed de Blasio in the lead. While de Blasio was coasting, Thompson scrambled to avoid another bitter disappointment, after coming surprisingly close to unseating Bloomberg in the last mayoral race four years ago. The only African-American candidate, Thompson completed a marathon 24-hour campaign blitz, battling to keep black voters from defecting to de Blasio, who is white. After stumping through the night, and voting in the morning, he took a nap, and hit the trail again. “I got a few hours of sleep, I feel good,” the 60-year-old Thompson said as he pressed the flesh in Flatbush, Brooklyn. “I’m hearing some very good things about turnout.” RELATED: BRONX CAMPAIGNERS DIDN'T GO 'ROUND HUNGRY Once a long shot to win the Democratic primary, de Blasio languished in fourth place for much of the year, with barely 10% of the vote. But he began to make his move in late July when Weiner’s candidacy imploded amid another sexting scandal and voters began hunting for an alternative. Then de Blasio cut the TV ads featuring his interracial family that turned his telegenic son into an unlikely star. De Blasio got enthusiastic receptions wherever he roamed Tuesday in a final push to get out the vote. Despite all the hoopla surrounding a 10-month campaign that featured 150 forums and more than 15 million in television advertising, turnout appeared to be spotty across the city — somewhere around 21% in the Democratic primary for mayor. The results represented a disappointing end for Liu, whose candidacy was upended by a fund-raising scandal. And the results likely ended the once-promising political career of Weiner. With Greg B.

Joe Lhota has won the Republican primary. With most of the votes counted, it's not certain yet if de Blasio has won the Democratic nomination or if Thompson got enough support for a runoff. There are still many votes to be counted, and it may be a week before the final results are known.

Jack Kingston and former Dollar General CEO David Perdue advanced to a Republican runoff in Georgia's Senate race, the Tea Party was left without a favored candidate. Yet the state's sizeable Tea Party crowd isn't staying on the sidelines. Tea Partyers now appear to be rallying behind Kingston, an 11-term congressman from Savannah who has the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a history of supporting federal projects in his district. It's the pragmatic side of the Tea Party and says as much about the movement as it does about Kingston, whose voting record has been very conservative in recent years. \\"We're more concerned with people's attitudes since the rise of the Tea Party,\\" said Sal Russo, chief strategist of the Tea Party Express, one of the largest Tea Party groups in the country. His group has yet to endorse in the July 22 Georgia runoff. The Georgia race is one of at least two instances in which the national business group and the Tea Party are finding common ground. The chamber and Russo's group also have backed Republican Rep. Steve Daines in his bid for a Senate seat in Montana, a key pickup opportunity for the GOP. Nationally, Republicans are pushing for a net gain of six seats to claim a majority in the Senate and can't afford to lose the Georgia seat. Democrats have rallied behind Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, and see her as one of their best chances to thwart GOP ambitions. The Tea Party hasn't fared that well in early primaries this year, although those were largely uphill races against well-funded Republican incumbents. And victories earlier this month by Tea Party-backed candidates in Nebraska and West Virginia Republican primaries are helping to reinvigorate the movement, which some had written off amid a difficult campaign season. In Nebraska, the primary victory by Republican Senate candidate Ben Sasse should help his party in November retain the open seat -- he is immediately considered the favorite for the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Mike Johanns. In West Virginia, former Maryland GOP chairman Alex Mooney won the Republican primary with spending help from such outside groups as the Madison Fund, the Senate Conservatives Fund and Tea Party Express. The Georgia race was a free-for-all and pitted three congressmen against Perdue and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. Handel and Rep. Paul Broun of Athens drew the most Tea Party support, with Handel carrying the endorsement of Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express. Handel finished a close third, while Broun trailed in fifth. In recent years, Kingston has moved steadily to the right with votes against raising the debt ceiling and a bipartisan budget bill. While campaigning, he points to a record of cutting spending as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Perdue's outsider message, of running against Washington and career politicians, would seem an easier sell with Tea Party activists seeking candidates willing to take on the establishment. But some of the first-time candidate's comments during the campaign may have set off alarms, and he faced sustained criticism as the front-runner in the final weeks before the primary. He won with 31 percent of the vote to Kingston's 26 percent. In one instance, Perdue argued he didn't mean raising taxes when he said both spending cuts and increased revenue would be needed to deal with the nation's debt. Perdue said he was talking about efforts to grow the economy, but his original comment prompted the conservative group FreedomWorks for America to declare: \\"Elect a Conservative, Not Perdue.\\" Handel on Wednesday backed Kingston and urged her nearly 133,000 supporters in the primary to do the same. One of Handel's chief supporters, Julianne Thompson with the Atlanta Tea Party, also endorsed Kingston. Perdue's campaign said the fact a few high-profile Tea Party activists are supporting Kingston doesn't mean rank-and-file members will fall in line. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

My dining experience at Sunshine Café can only be described as nothing short of fantastic, and I just have to share my thoughts with fellow food enthusiasts. I visited the café last Saturday for lunch, and from the warm welcome at the door to the last sip of my espresso, it was a delight all the way through. As we entered the restaurant, we were immediately struck by the cozy and inviting atmosphere. Soft lighting and ambient music created the perfect setting for a relaxing afternoon meal. The café's interior design reflected a perfect blend of modern and rustic elements, with wooden furniture and greenery in every corner. This attention to detail made us feel as if we had been transported into a serene oasis. Our server, Anna, was an absolute star. Greeting us with a broad smile, she took her time explaining the specials and answering our questions about the menu items. Her sincerity and extensive knowledge of the dishes were palpable, and made us feel confident in our selections. Throughout the entire meal, she was attentive without being intrusive and was more than happy to attend to our needs, refilling our water glasses even before we had to ask. Now, let's talk about the pièce-de-résistance—the food. To begin our culinary journey, we shared a beautifully plated beet salad with goat cheese, arugula, and candied walnuts. This dish represented a symphony of flavors, from the earthiness of the beets to the tanginess of the goat cheese and the sweetness of the walnuts. The salad was not only visually stunning, but also impeccably fresh. For our entrees, I opted for the pan-seared sea bass with roasted vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes, while my dining partner chose the rosemary-grilled chicken breast with wild mushroom risotto. The sea bass was cooked to perfection, maintaining its flaky, tender texture, and was accentuated by a rich lemon butter sauce. The chicken was juicy and aromatic, with the rosemary perfectly complementing the savory dish. The wild mushroom risotto, arguably the best I've ever had, offered a deliciously creamy bite packed with umami flavors. To round off our meal, we shared the café's signature chocolate lava cake with a side of homemade vanilla gelato. The cake was undeniably heavenly, offering a delightful contrast of warm, gooey chocolate interior and a moist cake exterior. Paired with the smooth, rich vanilla gelato, it was the perfect crescendo to our culinary escapade. As a final note, the pricing at Sunshine Café was very reasonable for the impeccable quality of food and service offered. This establishment is a must-visit for anyone seeking an exquisite dining experience in a welcoming and enchanting ambiance. I wholeheartedly recommend Sunshine Café and can't wait to return for more incredible meals."},{"question":"Question: Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations. Which path will allow for more time for the pheromones on that path to evaporate? Answer:","response":"In order to determine which path will allow for more time for the pheromones to evaporate, we should consider the following steps: Step 1: Identify the factors affecting pheromone evaporation The evaporation of pheromones depends on the time spent traveling along each path, the distance of the path, and the rate at which pheromones evaporate. Step 2: Compare the distances of the two paths We already know that path A is 100 meters long, while path B is 150 meters long. Therefore, path B is 1.5 times longer than path A. Step 3: Estimate the time spent on each path Assuming that ants travel at a constant speed on both paths, it will take longer for ants to traverse path B than path A due to the difference in lengths. Since path B is 1.5 times longer than path A, it would take ants approximately 1.5 times longer to travel path B compared to path A. Step 4: Analyze the effect of time on pheromone evaporation Pheromone evaporation occurs over time, and the longer it takes ants to traverse a path, the more time the pheromones on that path have to evaporate. As it takes ants approximately 1.5 times longer to cover path B compared to path A, pheromones on path B have more time to evaporate. Conclusion: Based on these observations, path B will allow for more time for the pheromones on that path to evaporate."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: A second-rate boarding school is run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot). Delassalle also has a relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him.

Article: Australian cities can keep their native wildlife -- but only if they can kick their habit of urban sprawl . That's the finding of a new study by leading Australian environmental researchers Jessica Sushinsky, Professor Hugh Possingham and Dr Richard Fuller of The University of Queensland. \\"While urban development usually reduces the number of birds in a city, building more compact cities and avoiding urban sprawl can slow these reductions greatly,\\" says lead author Jessica Sushinsky. \\"Compact housing development leaves birds' homes untouched, leading to fewer losses of birds.\\" The researchers surveyed native and wild birds in Brisbane's urban areas, including living and industrial areas, public parks and gardens, major roadways and airports. They then used statistical modeling to find out what will happen to the birds as the city grows. The first setting was compact growth -- where multiple homes are built on land that previously had only one house. The second setting was sprawling growth -- a familiar pattern where homes are built here and there beyond the city's current boundaries. The team's forecasts showed that a much greater diversity of species was lost over 20 years in the sprawling setting compared to the more compact setting. \\"Urban sprawl resulted in the disappearance of many urban-sensitive birds -- birds that only live in areas where there is native vegetation , such as parklands and woodlands,\\" Ms Sushinsky says. \\"On the other hand, we found the city with the compact development attracted more birds because it kept more of its parks and green areas.\\" Now the Queensland Government has adopted the more compact urban growth strategy, which, Dr Richard Fuller says, is good news for Australia's native birds.

Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him.

It argues the UK is already slipping down the international innovation league tables. The UK has dropped to eighth globally in the number of US patents registered. The report estimates 830,000 graduate-level Stem experts and 450,000 technicians will be needed by 2020. In the UK some 23,000 engineers are graduating every year. But India is producing eight times as many, and China 20 times as many. The report warns overall that the current pool of science, technology and engineering experts are already \\"stretched thin\\" and ageing rapidly. The median age of chartered engineers rises by 10 years for every 14 that pass. UK firms are already having to recruit experts from abroad. The report adds that the requirement for 100,000 Stem graduates per year between 2012 and 2020 will not be met by newly graduating students alone, and calls for Stem experts to be trained through other routes. \\"With only circa 90,000 Stem graduates each year (including international students who presently cannot obtain visas to work in the UK after graduation) and knowing from earlier analysis of Hesa [Higher Education Statistics Agency] data that a proportion of Stem graduates choose non science occupations (26% of engineering graduates for example) there are clearly too few UK Stem graduates to meet the need,\\" it says. Prof Matthew Harrison, director of engineering and education at the Royal Academy of Engineering, said the shortage of Stem graduates was getting worse. \\"In the last 10 years the general wage premium for graduates has been dropping, but over the same period the graduate premium for engineering has been going up. \\"Engineering firms are crying out for engineers.

He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside Francois Couperin. Little is known about Rameau's early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. Along with Francois Couperin, Rameau is one of the two masters of the French school of harpsichord music in the 18th century. Both composers made a decisive break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists, who confined their compositions to the relatively fixed mould of the classical suite. This reached its apogee in the first decade of the 18th century with successive collections of pieces by Louis Marchand, Gaspard Le Roux, Louis-Nicolas Clerambault, Jean-Francois Dandrieu, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Charles Dieupart, and Nicolas Siret. Rameau and Couperin have different styles. They seem not to have known one another (Couperin was one of the official court musicians while Rameau was still an unknown; fame would only come to him after Couperin's death). Rameau published his first book of harpsichord pieces in 1706 while Couperin (who was fifteen years his senior) waited until 1713 before publishing his first \\"ordres.\\" Rameau's music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the French suite: imitative (\\"Le rappel des oiseaux,\\" \\"La poule\\") and character (\\"Les tendres plaintes\\", \\"L'entretien des Muses\\") pieces and works of pure virtuosity that resemble Scarlatti (\\"Les tourbillons,\\" \\"Les trois mains\\") as well as pieces that reveal the experiments of a theorist and musical innovator (\\"L'Enharmonique\\", \\"Les Cyclopes\\"), which had a marked influence on Daquin, Royer, and Jacques Duphly. The suites are grouped in the traditional way, by key. Rameau's three collections appeared in 1706, 1724 and 1726 or 1727, respectively. After this, he only composed a single piece for the harpsichord: \\"La Dauphine\\" (1747). Other works, such as \\"Les petits marteaux,\\" have been doubtfully attributed to him. During his semiretirement in the years 1740 to 1744, he wrote the Pieces de clavecin en concert (1741), which some musicologists consider the pinnacle of French Baroque chamber music. Adopting a formula successfully employed by Mondonville a few years earlier, these pieces differ from trio sonatas in that the harpsichord is not simply there as basso continuo to accompany other instruments (the violin, flute or viol) playing the melody but has an equal part in the \\"concert\\" with them. Rameau also claimed that the pieces would be equally satisfying as solo harpsichord works--although this statement is far from convincing, since the composer took the trouble to transcribe five of them himself--those where the lack of other instruments would show the least. What were some of his pieces?","response":"Jean-Philippe Rameau composed a wide range of pieces spanning various genres, including operas, cantatas, motets, and chamber music. His works for the harpsichord were particularly groundbreaking and influential. Some of his most notable pieces are: 1. Operas: Rameau wrote over 30 operas, of which some of the most famous ones include: - Hippolyte et Aricie (1733) - Castor et Pollux (1737) - Dardanus (1739) - Les Indes Galantes (1735) - Platée (1745) 2. Cantatas: - Thétis (1718) - Aquilon et Orithie (1719) - Diane et Actéon (c. 1715-1720) 3. Motets: Rameau's motets include: - Deus noster refugium (c. 1713-1715) - In convertendo Dominus (c. 1717-1720) - Quam dilecta (c. 1713-1715) 4. Chamber Music: - Pièces de clavecin en concert (1741), collection of five sets of chamber pieces featuring the harpsichord, violin or flute, and viola da gamba. 5. Harpsichord Works: As one of the leading composers for the harpsichord, Rameau's published collections include: - Premier Livre de Pièces de Clavecin (1706) - Nouvelles Suites de Pièces de Clavecin (1726-1727) Some individual pieces from these collections are: - La Villageoise - Le Rappel des Oiseaux - La Poule - Les Tendres Plaintes - L'Entretien des Muses - Les Tourbillons - Les Trois Mains - L'Enharmonique - Les Cyclopes - La Dauphine (1747) - a standalone harpsichord piece unconnected to a collection. These are just a few examples of Rameau's extensive body of work, which had a significant impact on French music during the 18th century and beyond. His innovative compositions and theoretical contributions laid the groundwork for the development of both French opera and the harpsichord repertoire."},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Michael \\"Jakko\\" Jakszyk (born Michael Lee Curran, 8 June 1958) is an English musician, record producer, and actor. He has released several solo albums as a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist and has been the lead singer for King Crimson since 2013. His work has been variously credited to \\"Jakko\\", \\"Jakko Jakszyk\\", and \\"Jakko M. Jakszyk\\". Before joining King Crimson, he led bands for over thirty years, including 64 Spoons, Dizrhythmia, 21st Century Schizoid Band, Jakszyk Fripp Collins, and Rapid Eye Movement. By 1975, Jakszyk was leading an eccentric jazz-rock band called Soon After. His self-confessed \\"dictatorial tendencies\\" reduced a bigger line-up to a trio of \\"two screaming lead guitars and a trumpet\\" (the latter played by ex-National Youth Jazz Orchestra member Ted Emmett). The band reached the finals of the 1975 Melody Maker National Rock/Folk competition, finishing third to a heavy metal band featuring future Clash co-leader Mick Jones and to a big band featuring future saxophone session musician Gary Barnacle. When Soon After split up, Jakszyk toured with \\"a strange little band\\" which supported Camel, Stackridge, and Judas Priest, then briefly joined a Tring-based band called Synthesis which played progressive rock in the Canterbury-scene vein. Jakszyk's first significant band was 64 Spoons, which he joined as guitarist and lead singer in 1976, co-writing much of the band's material. Between 1976 and 1980, 64 Spoons wrote and performed a blend of pop, progressive rock, jazz, and comedy (typified by their single \\"Ladies Don't Have Willies\\"). Boosted by an exuberant and funny live show, 64 Spoons proved popular with audiences but failed to gain an effective record deal or media breakthrough and split up in 1980. Their only album, Landing on a Rat Column, was eventually released in 1992, many years after it was recorded. Jakszyk would described them as \\"the wrong band at the wrong time\\". 64 Spoons's work did, however, lead to friendships with several of the musicians who had inspired the band, notably keyboard player Dave Stewart. Following the split of 64 Spoons, Jakszyk joined Stewart, Rick Biddulph, and Pip Pyle in the band Rapid Eye Movement. Jakszyk contributed several songs to the band's repertoire (\\"One More Time\\", \\"I'll Stand On My Own\\", \\"Ingmar Bergman on the Window Sill\\", \\"Straining Our Eyes\\", and \\"Dear Clare\\", the last of these a 64 Spoons song) and co-wrote material with Stewart (\\"This Is Not What I Want\\" and \\"'Allo Darlin' I Work on the Fair\\"). Between August 1980 and June 1981, Rapid Eye Movement toured Spain, France, and the UK and recorded material but split up due to Stewart's desire to concentrate on studio work (Jakszyk sang on the original version of Stewart's cover of \\"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted?\\", later a hit with a new vocal track by the Zombies' lead singer Colin Blunstone). During this period, Jakszyk also contributed to sessions for the former Van der Graaf Generator saxophonist David Jackson's album The Long Hello Vol. 3 (eventually released in 1982).

If the answer is 'Saint John the Baptist'; explain the reasoning:","response":"Mission San Juan Capistrano was not named after Saint John the Baptist, but rather after Saint John of Capistrano (Giovanni da Capistrano), a 15th-century Franciscan priest, theologian, and reformer from Italy. The mission, founded by Spanish Franciscan priest Junipero Serra on November 1, 1776, is the seventh of the 21 Spanish missions established in present-day California. It is located in the present-day city of San Juan Capistrano, Orange County, California. The reason for naming the mission after Saint John of Capistrano was to honor and commemorate his contributions to the Catholic Church and the Franciscan Order. St. John of Capistrano was known for his preaching, theological writings, and his efforts to reform and revitalize the Order. The practice of naming missions after saints was common among the Spanish missionaries, as they sought the protection and guidance of these holy figures in their evangelization efforts and establishment of new settlements."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A small white dog holds a bird in its mouth as it runs in a field.\\" can we conclude that \\"The dog has a white bird in its mouth.\\"?

The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. - Coconut milk is the liquid that comes from the grated meat of a brown coconut . It should not be confused with coconut water . The color and rich taste of coconut milk can be attributed to the high oil content . Most of the fat is saturated fat . Coconut milk is a very popular food ingredient used in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Southern China , the Caribbean and north of South America . - Coconut water is the clear liquid inside young green coconuts (fruits of the coconut palm). In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development. As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut meat. - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. 'coconut milk' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'natural product of taxon'? Choices: - cocos nucifera - mammal The answer to this question is:","response":"- cocos nucifera"},{"question":"If a dude can do this I will thank him and shake his hand How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","response":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as mixed, with elements of both positive and negative emotions. From a positive perspective, the mention of gratitude through the words \\"thank him\\" and the intention to engage in a friendly, physical gesture of shaking hands convey a sense of appreciation and admiration. The author appears to be expressing a heartfelt feeling of thankfulness for someone who can accomplish a specific task, and this appreciation may be a response to a truly impressive performance or a challenging mission that has been successfully executed. It also shows that the author values the effort or skill invested in completing this task and is eager to express it through acknowledgement and interpersonal connection. On the other hand, from a negative angle, the tweet can be interpreted as containing a tone of skepticism or doubt. The phrase \\"If a dude can do this\\" comes across as possibly suggesting that achieving the mentioned task is a rare or difficult feat, thus casting doubt on whether or not someone would be able to accomplish it. This can indicate a sense of uncertainty, possibly hinting that the author has a hard time believing that someone could successfully complete the task at hand, or might be expressing disbelief related to the magnitude or complexity of the task. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is a blend of both positive (expression of gratitude and admiration) and negative (skepticism and doubt) emotions, making it a relatively complex statement that goes beyond simple characterizations of sentiment. To accurately describe the emotions conveyed in this tweet, it's essential to recognize the simultaneous feelings of appreciation, admiration, skepticism, and doubt present within it."},{"question":"\\"a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","response":"Step 1: Identify the main sentiment words or phrases in the sentence.

I was prescribed Hydrocodone for the pain before the surgery but complained about not being able to sleep . So after the surgery my Dr. prescribed Oxycodone . What must have happened before the person required surgery ?","response":"Before the person required surgery for their torn cartilage in the right knee, several events and factors might have contributed to the injury and the decision for surgical intervention. Here is a detailed account of possible events leading up to the surgery: 1. Initial Injury: The person may have experienced a traumatic event or participated in an activity that put stress on the knee joint, leading to the tear in the cartilage. This could involve sports, accidents, or a sudden twist or impact on the knee. Common sports that can cause knee injuries include soccer, basketball, skiing, and running. 2. Onset of Symptoms: After the initial injury, the person likely started experiencing symptoms such as pain, swelling, stiffness, and reduced range of motion in the affected knee. They might also have felt a locking or catching sensation when trying to move the joint. 3. Initial Consultation: The individual probably sought medical advice from a healthcare professional due to the persistent symptoms. The physician might have conducted a physical examination, assessed the knee's range of motion, and palpated the joint to identify any abnormalities. 4. Diagnostic Tests: To confirm the diagnosis of torn cartilage, the healthcare professional may have ordered additional imaging tests, such as an X-ray, MRI, or CT scan, to get a detailed view of the knee joint and surrounding structures. This would help determine the extent of the injury and rule out any other possible conditions. 5. Non-Surgical Treatment: In some cases, prior to deciding on surgery, the physician may have recommended conservative treatment options to manage the pain and inflammation, such as rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE), and over-the-counter pain medications. Additionally, the person might have been advised to use crutches, a knee brace, or participate in physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint and improve mobility. 6. Evaluation of Treatment Progress: After attempting non-surgical treatment options, the healthcare professional likely assessed the person's progress to determine if the symptoms had improved or if further intervention was required. This might include follow-up appointments, physical examinations, and additional imaging tests. 7. Decision for Surgery: If conservative treatment options failed to alleviate the symptoms or if the cartilage tear was severe, the healthcare professional might have determined that surgery was necessary to repair the damage and prevent further complications. This decision would have been based on factors such as the person's age, activity level, pain tolerance, and overall health. 8. Preoperative Appointment: Prior to surgery, the person would have had a preoperative consultation to discuss the surgical procedure, potential risks and complications, and necessary preparations. The physician may have also ordered preoperative tests, such as blood work, to ensure the individual was fit for surgery. In summary, the person likely experienced an injury that led to a tear in the cartilage of their right knee. They would have undergone several steps to diagnose the issue and attempt non-surgical treatments before ultimately requiring surgery. During this process, they were prescribed Hydrocodone for pain management but requested an alternative medication due to sleep-related side effects. Consequently, their doctor prescribed Oxycodone following the surgery."},{"question":"Solve -20*j - 5117 = 215*j - 116*j for j.","response":"To solve the equation -20*j - 5117 = 215*j - 116*j for j, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation.

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

Thomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees disturbing visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body.The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine.After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Gabriel says Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it. Should the rebellious angels win, Heaven will become like Hell with earth in its thrall. Simon refuses to reveal its location, and Gabriel kills him, ripping out his heart. Mary shows signs of possession by the evil soul; she suddenly recounts an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. Thomas visits a church to reflect and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel. He is beginning to understand the nature of the jealous angels who hate humans because God loves them most.At school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas there. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. Inside, they find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. They rush back to Mary's home, only to find Gabriel and Jerry there. Thomas kills Jerry, who thanks him for the release. Katherine stops Gabriel temporarily when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. The three protagonists flee to a Native American site where Mary can be exorcised. In a hospital ICU ward, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachel, just as she dies of a terminal illness. He needs her because he doesn't know how to drive.That night, Lucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that \\"other angels\\" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows of Gabriel's plot to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels, and he knows that if Gabriel wins, under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell. That's unwanted competition. The next day, Lucifer appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual. Thomas kills Rachel, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel.Lucifer appears first encouraging the tribe to complete the exorcism. Then he confronts Gabriel telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Gabriel taunts Lucifer about his past when he fell from grace; Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels out Hawthorne's soul, a rancid cloud of evil. The \\"enemy ghost\\" starts to attack the people but a bright light from Heaven immediately destroys it.

Question: suppose more carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER satelites in space. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"more effect. An increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can cause atmospheric changes, which in turn can affect satellites in space, especially smaller or less advanced ones. Here are some ways the consequences of more CO2 in the atmosphere can impact these satellites: 1. Atmospheric Drag: Higher CO2 concentrations can cause the Earth's atmosphere to expand. This expansion could result in increased atmospheric drag, which affects orbiting satellites – particularly those in low Earth orbit (LEO). Smaller satellites are more susceptible to such drag forces, which could necessitate more frequent orbit maintenance maneuvers to counteract the influence of atmospheric drag. This would lead to increased fuel consumption and shorter operational lifetimes for smaller satellites. 2. Space Debris: With expanding atmosphere, the density of space debris in LEO could increase as well. Collisions between existing space debris can create additional fragments, further increasing the risk of collision for operational satellites. Smaller satellites are generally less protected and more vulnerable to damage in the event of a collision with space debris. 3. Radiation: More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could potentially alter atmospheric chemistry and affect the Earth's radiation belts. This may result in increased radiation exposure for satellites, which could cause damage to sensitive electronics, particularly for smaller satellites that may have less radiation protection. 4. Thermal Control: Increasing CO2 levels could change thermal properties of the Earth's atmosphere, which might affect the thermal control systems of satellites. Smaller satellites typically have limited thermal control capabilities, and changes in the atmospheric temperature could lead to issues with overheating or freezing of satellite components. In conclusion, an increase in carbon dioxide levels is likely to have a 'more effect' on smaller satellites, as it can contribute to higher atmospheric drag, increased space debris risk, potentially increased radiation exposure, and changes to thermal control requirements. These effects might necessitate more frequent maintenance, increased shielding, and shorter operational lifetimes for such satellites."},{"question":"Items such as medicine, cars, or grain transported on a train is called what?

A: The rose window is the earliest-known example above the West portal in France. Does the answer correctly answer the question","response":"A: My apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Now, let me provide you with a detailed answer concerning the three large portals used in the construction of the Roman Arch of Constantine. The Arch of Constantine, located in Rome near the Colosseum, was erected in the year 315 AD to commemorate Constantine the Great's victory over Maxentius in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 AD. This triumphal arch features three large portals, which were utilized for several reasons: 1. Architectural Aesthetics: The use of three portals was a distinctive architectural feature of ancient Roman triumphal arches. The design allowed for a more visually appealing and symmetrical structure, which was an essential aspect of monumental architecture during that time. Employing three portals instead of a single one enhanced the grandeur and visual impact of the arch, making it an imposing structure that could be easily recognized as a symbol of victory and imperial power. 2. Symbolism: The three portals had a symbolic significance for the Romans. Ancient triumphs, which were grand parades celebrating military victories, traditionally passed through a triumphal arch and proceeded along the streets of Rome. The three portals would have allowed the procession to pass through the central, largest portal, with the emperor himself riding on a chariot. The side portals would have been used by the accompanying soldiers and people, further emphasizing the importance of the victorious leader at the center of the procession and symbolizing the unity of the Roman people behind their emperor. 3. Spolia and Reuse of Previous Artworks: The Arch of Constantine is known for its extensive use of spolia, which refers to the practice of incorporating pieces of older artwork and architectural elements into a new structure. Multiple elements of the Arch of Constantine, including its friezes, statues, and decorative features, were repurposed from earlier monuments, especially those belonging to the reign of Emperor Trajan and his successors, Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius. By designing the arch with three large portals, the architects could effectively incorporate these earlier elements while creating a new monument that paid tribute to both the past and the present. This was also a means to evoke the memory of the previous \\"good emperors\\" and associate Constantine with their greatness, legitimacy, and authority. In conclusion, the use of three large portals in the construction of the Roman Arch of Constantine served various purposes, including the enhancement of architectural aesthetics, the symbolic representation of triumphs and the emperor's authority, and the effective incorporation of spolia for historical continuity and legitimacy."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

If a judge dismisses the case or concludes the trial without deciding the facts in the defendant's favor (for example, by dismissing the case on procedural grounds), the case is a mistrial and may normally be retried. Furthermore, if a jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge may declare a mistrial and order a retrial as was addressed in United States v. Josef Perez, 22 U.S. 579 (1824). When the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, even if the prosecutor or judge caused the error that forms the basis of the motion. An exception exists, however, where the prosecutor or judge has acted in bad faith. In Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667 (1982), the Supreme Court held that \`\`only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to 'goad' the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.'' Question: does double jeopardy apply to a hung jury?","response":"No, double jeopardy does not apply to a hung jury. Double jeopardy means you cannot be tried for the same crime twice. If a jury cannot agree on a decision, which is called a hung jury, the judge might say it's a mistrial. In this case, the trial did not have a clear ending, so they can have a new trial to try to reach a decision. This does not count as double jeopardy because the first trial did not really have a proper ending."},{"question":"Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Dr. Arnold's evaluation will determine Karla's eligibility for parole. During the session, Dr. Arnold shows Karla a photo album of herself and her husband Paul Bernardo (Misha Collins) in happier times, and Karla has a memory of how they first met. However, when Dr. Arnold introduces the subject of Karla's sister Tammy, Karla becomes uncooperative. Over the following weeks, Dr. Arnold probes Karla about her knowledge of Paul's secret life as a serial rapist, and it is revealed that shortly before their marriage Paul began to rape women. Paul convinced Karla to help him rape her sister on camera. At first Karla disagrees, but eventually steals Halcion from the veterinary clinic where she works. Tammy gets drunk at a Christmas party and becomes unresponsive after the two drug her. Tammy is raped, and ends up getting sick while drugged, choking on her own vomit. Karla calls 911 and the two hide the assault evidence so her death would appear accidental. Afterwards, Paul beats Karla for \\"ruining his movie\\". Karla learns never to ruin Paul's \\"movies\\". Karla tells Dr. Arnold that Paul became obsessed with Tammy and kept watching the video after her death, even showing it to friends. Paul also threatened to reveal Karla's role in her sister's murder if he should get into any more trouble, but Karla finally leaves him anyway.

I've got a love/hate relationship with the Body Shop, the love being directed at their products and the hate at their prices. Although the Body Shop is quite a popular chain, I'm never amazed at the sheer deliciousness of the place everytime I step into one of their stores. They've put so much detail into each and every product I feel as though I'm in a one of a kind shop when I'm there. I've spent hours agonizing over their body butters, and my favourites, after trying quite a few indeed, have to be the coconut and almond ones. The body shop also used to sell a vanilla/chocolate smellgasm perfume, Amaretto, which I was sad to find out had been discontinued. Thankfully, the range of perfume oils definitely make up for this sad loss.

How would you accomplish this goal?","response":"To accomplish the goal of making a book holder for children's books, you can follow these steps: 1. Ideation and Planning: Before you start making the book holder, brainstorm some design ideas and think about what features and functionalities you would like it to have. For instance, do you want a simple open-shelf design, a closed cabinet, or one with compartments for different book sizes? Make sure your design is ergonomic, easily accessible by the child, and visually appealing. 2. Materials and Tools: Once you have a clear vision of what you want your book holder to look like, gather all the necessary materials and tools required. Some popular material choices include wood, plywood, MDF, or plastic. The tools needed may include a saw, screwdriver, hammer, measuring tape, level, pencil, drill, screws, wood glue, sandpaper, and a paintbrush or roller. 3. Measurements: Measure the space where you plan to place the book holder and decide on the dimensions based on the available area and the number of books you wish to store. Keep in mind children's height and accessibility while deciding the dimensions. 4. Cutting the Material: Following your plan, start by marking and cutting the material according to the desired dimensions. Make sure to use the appropriate saw and safety gear during this process. Cut all the necessary pieces such as shelves, sides, back, and top if applicable. 5. Sanding: Before assembling the pieces, it's essential to sand their edges and surfaces. This step helps create a smooth finish and avoid any rough edges that could be harmful to children. 6. Assembly: Lay out all the cut pieces and, following your design, begin assembling your book holder. You can use wood glue to attach the parts, screws to secure them, and a level to ensure the shelves are straight. If your design includes slots or dividers, install them now. If it has doors, attach them with hinges and add the handles. 7. Finishing touches: Inspect your assembled book holder for any imperfections, then sand as needed. Fill any gaps or holes with wood filler, smooth with a fine-grit sandpaper, and clean off any dust using a damp cloth. 8. Painting or Staining: Choose a paint or stain color that complements the room's decor and is safe for children. Apply a primer if needed, and then paint or stain the book holder following the manufacturer's instructions. You may need multiple coats to get the desired finish. Allow the paint or stain to dry completely. 9. Adding Personal Touches: You could further personalize the book holder by adding stickers, decals, or stencils that represent the child's interests. Another option is using chalkboard paint on one side, allowing the child to draw and write directly on the book holder. 10. Positioning and Organizing: Once the paint is dry, move the book holder to its designated spot and fill it with children's books. Organize the books by size, series, or favorite categories, making sure the most frequently used ones are easily accessible. By following these steps, you'll create a beautiful, functional, and safe book holder that encourages children to read and tidy up after themselves."},{"question":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Waterman, food = Italian, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 3 out of 5, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes Sentence:","response":"The Waterman is a modestly priced, family-friendly Italian restaurant, ideally situated by the riverside, where patrons can enjoy a collection of delectable traditional and contemporary Italian dishes amidst a serene waterfront environment.

Options: - bus stop - graph - post office - grass - play reasoning:","response":"You can add a line to a graph. Reasoning: - Bus stop: Adding a line to a bus stop might not make much sense, since a line is more of an abstract concept, while a bus stop is a physical place or structure. - Graph: In the context of a graph, a line usually represents a relationship between two variables, or a trend in the data. It makes sense to add a line to a graph if you are displaying data or illustrating a concept. - Post office: Similar to a bus stop, a post office is a physical location, and adding a line to it does not seem logical. - Grass: Grass is a type of plant, and adding a line to it does not have any clear meaning or purpose. - Play: A play typically refers to a scripted performance, and though you can add lines of dialogue to a play, the phrasing of the question suggests more of a visual or mathematical context, which aligns better with a graph. In conclusion, adding a line to a graph is the most appropriate option, as it serves a direct purpose: either representing data or illustrating a relationship between various elements."},{"question":"Given the question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Nice good I love it Verygoodgood app\\" The answer is:","response":"Based on the content and structure of the review provided: \\"Nice good I love it Verygoodgood app,\\" the rating for this review can be broken down into the following: 1.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore.

Context: We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am.

It was constituted in 1983, although it existed for the first time during the First Spanish Republic in the 19th century. León first appeared as a Kingdom in 910, whilst the Kingdom of Castile gained an independent identity in 1065 and was intermittently held in personal union with León before merging with it permanently in 1230. It is the largest autonomous community in Spain and the third largest region of the European Union, covering an area of with an official population of around 2.5 million (2011). - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast.

The town is located east of the county town of Lewes and south east of London, and has an estimated population of 90,254, which makes it the 66th largest settlement in the United Kingdom. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Hylaeochampsidae is an extinct family of basal eusuchian crocodylomorphs thought to be closely related to the order Crocodylia. It was first constructed by Charles William Andrews in 1913 to include just one member: \\"Hylaeochampsa\\". However, a new genus named \\"Iharkutosuchus\\" was described in 2007 and was found to be a sister taxon of \\"Hylaeochampsa\\", and thus a member of the family Hylaeochampsidae. The genus \\"Heterosuchus\\", named in 1887, may also be a member of the family. However, it is likely to be synonymous with \\"Hylaeochampsa\\" and has been considered a \\"nomen dubium\\" by James M. Clark and Mark Norell. Clark and Norell also claimed that there is no evidence to suggest that the two genera form a true clade distinct from other eusuchians, because remains associated with \\"Heterosuchus\\" are to fragmentary to show any clear phylogenetic relationship. A fourth genus called \\"Pietraroiasuchus\\" was assigned to Hylaeochampsidae in 2011. A phylogenetic analysis conducted with the description of \\"Pietraroiasuchus\\" also found \\"Pachycheilosuchus\\" to be part of the family. - The Eusuchia (\\"true crocodiles\\") are a clade of crocodylomorphs that first appears in the Early Cretaceous with \\"Hylaeochampsa\\". Along with Dyrosauridae and Sebecosuchia, they were the only crocodyliformes who survived the K-T extinction. Since the other two clades died out 35 and 11 million years ago, all living crocodilian species are eusuchians, as are many extinct forms. - The Early Cretaceous/Middle Cretaceous (geochronological name) or the Lower Cretaceous (chronostratigraphic name), is the earlier or lower of the two major divisions of the Cretaceous. It is usually considered to stretch from 146 Ma to 100 Ma. - The Vectis Formation is a geological formation on the Isle of Wight, England whose strata date back to the Early Cretaceous (lowermost Aptian stage, 125 million years ago). The Vectis Formation is composed of three geological members: the Shepherds Chine member, the Barnes High Sandstone member, and the Cowleaze Chine member. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation. - Heterosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodylomorph that may have been an eusuchian . It is known only from neck and back vertebrae recovered from Early Cretaceous - age rocks of the Hastings Beds ( Wealden Group of Hastings , Sussex . These vertebrae are procoelous ( ball - and - socket articulation with the socket in front and the ball on the back of individual vertebrae ) , which is a trait of eusuchians . Heterosuchus was described by Harry Seeley in 1887 , with H. valdensis as the type species . It may be the same genus as the slightly younger Hylaeochampsa , inferred to have been of similar evolutionary grade , but there is no overlapping material as Hylaeochampsa is known only from a partial skull ; Hylaeochampsa would be the name used for both in that case , because it is the older name ( coined in 1874 ) . Because of the sparse material and apparent lack of distinguishing characteristics , James Clark and Mark Norell ( 1992 ) considered Heterosuchus a dubious name . - Sussex (abbreviated Sx), from the Old English \\"Sþsaxe\\" (South Saxons), is a historic county in South East England corresponding roughly in area to the ancient Kingdom of Sussex. It is bounded to the west by Hampshire, north by Surrey, north-east by Kent, south by the English Channel, and divided for local government into West Sussex and East Sussex and the city of Brighton and Hove. Brighton and Hove was created as a unitary authority in 1997, and granted City status in 2000. Until then, Chichester was Sussex's only city. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - Iharkutosuchus (\\"Iharkút crocodile\\", after where it was found) is an extinct genus of basal eusuchian crocodyliform. It fossils have been found in the Santonian-age Upper Cretaceous Csehbánya Formation in the Bakony Mountains of western Hungary. It is based on MTM 2006.52.1, a nearly complete skull, and several other partial skulls, isolated skull bones, and numerous teeth are also known. \\"Iharkutosuchus\\" was a small crocodyliform (skull length , estimated body length ). Its skull was low, and the snout was short. \\"Iharkutosuchus\\" is unusual in its heterodonty: some of its teeth were complex and multicusped, like mammal teeth. The structure of the skull indicates that it could grind food with a mobile lower jaw, and together with the teeth suggest a diet of fibrous plant material. The genus was described in 2007 by Attila si and colleagues. The type species is \\"I. makadii\\", for László Makádi. - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government. - Hampshire (; abbreviated Hants, archaically known as the County of Southampton) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom (excluding the metropolitan counties) with almost half of the county's population living within the South Hampshire conurbation which includes the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. The larger South Hampshire metropolitan area has a population of 1,547,000. Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force. It is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Hylaeochampsa is an extinct genus of eusuchian crocodylomorph. It is known only from a partial skull recovered from Barremian-age rocks of the Lower Cretaceous Vectis Formation (Wealden Group) of the Isle of Wight. This skull, BMNH R 177, is short and wide, with a eusuchian-like palate and inferred enlarged posterior teeth that would have been suitable for crushing. \\"Hylaochampsa\\" was described by Richard Owen in 1874, with \\"H. vectiana\\" as the type species. It may be the same genus as the slightly older \\"Heterosuchus\\", inferred to have been of similar evolutionary grade, but there is no overlapping material as \\"Heterosuchus\\" is known only from vertebrae. If the two could be shown to be synonyms, \\"Hylaeochampsa\\" would have priority because it is the older name. \\"Hylaeochampsa\\" is the type genus of the family Hylaeochampsidae, which also includes \\"Iharkutosuchus\\" from the Late Cretaceous of Hungary. James Clark and Mark Norell positioned it as the sister group to Crocodylia. \\"Hylaeochampsa\\" is currently the oldest known eusuchian.

Answer: The Earth's atmosphere is composed of four primary layers which are differentiated based on temperature changes as altitude increases. These four layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere: 1. Troposphere: The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface up to approximately 8 kilometers at the poles and 18 kilometers at the equator. It contains approximately 75% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of its water vapor. The troposphere is characterized by a decrease in temperature with increasing altitude as warm air near the Earth's surface rises and cools. Weather events such as rain, snow, clouds, and winds predominantly occur in the troposphere. 2. Stratosphere: The stratosphere is situated above the troposphere, extending from around 10 to 50 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, is located within the stratosphere. This layer is characterized by an increase in temperature with altitude, primarily due to the absorption of UV radiation by ozone molecules. There is minimal weather or turbulence in the stratosphere, which is why commercial aircraft typically fly within this layer. 3. Mesosphere: The mesosphere lies above the stratosphere and extends from approximately 50 to 85 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The mesosphere is characterized by a decrease in temperature with altitude, with the coldest temperatures in the Earth's atmosphere being found near the top of this layer at around -90° Celsius (-130° Fahrenheit). The mesosphere is the atmospheric layer in which meteors typically burn up and create \\"shooting stars.\\" Noctilucent clouds, a rare type of cloud formed from ice particles, can also be found in the mesosphere. 4. Thermosphere: The thermosphere is the highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, extending from around 85 to 600 kilometers above the Earth's surface. In this layer, temperature increases with altitude as solar radiation directly heats molecules in the atmosphere. This leads to temperatures that can exceed 2,500° Celsius (4,500° Fahrenheit), although the sparse distribution of gas particles would make it feel cold to humans. The thermosphere contains the ionosphere, a region where charged particles or ions are created from interactions between solar radiation and gas molecules. The ionosphere plays a crucial role in long-distance radio communication and is also the layer where the auroras, such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis, are formed. Overall, the four layers of Earth's atmosphere exhibit a distinct pattern of temperature change with altitude due to various chemical reactions and the absorption of solar radiation. Each layer possesses unique characteristics, playing a role in regulating weather, protecting the Earth from UV radiation, and accommodating human-made technologies like aviation and radio communication."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Deputy Chief Operating Officer James Murdoch faced aggressive questioning from British lawmakers over his handling and account of the company's phone-hacking scandal. While Mr. Murdoch in one instance altered details of earlier testimony, he again insisted that he didn't know until late last year the extent of illicit activities at the company's former News of the World tabloid. Enlarge Image Close Associated Press News Corp.'s James Murdoch, seen in a video image, said 'it is appalling' News of the World had an investigator follow lawyers for hacking victims. In his second appearance this year before a parliamentary committee probing hacking, Mr. Murdoch on Thursday deflected suggestions that he bungled the company's management of the scandal over the U.K. newspaper's illegal interception of voice-mail messages during the reporting process. The scandal has led to the resignation of senior News Corp. executives, the closure of the newspaper and more than a dozen arrests. Mr. Murdoch denied that he misled the committee in prior testimony in July and accused former News Corp. employees—News of the World editor Colin Myler and lawyer Tom Crone—of giving misleading testimony. In statements to the Guardian newspaper Thursday, Mr. Myler said his testimony had been \\"accurate and consistent.\\" Mr. Crone called Mr. Murdoch's testimony \\"disingenuous.\\" Mr. Murdoch conceded that News Corp.'s handling of the phone-hacking affair had been undermined by the company's inclination to reject legitimate criticism as persecution from rivals. It was \\"the tendency for a period of time to react to criticism or allegations as hostile or motivated commercially or politically,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. \\"What we didn't do, I think, necessarily, is reflect as dispassionately as we might have.\\" Web of Connections Learn more about who's who and how they're all connected in the scandal over allegations of voice-mail interceptions and corrupt payments to police. View Interactive More photos and interactive graphics One member of Parliament compared News Corp.'s U.K. newspaper unit to organized crime. \\"You must be the first mafia boss in history who was not aware that he was running a criminal enterprise,\\" said Tom Watson, a Labour politician and one of News Corp.'s harshest critics. Mr. Murdoch called the comment inappropriate and offensive. News Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal. In revisiting the details of his handling of the hacking scandal, Mr. Murdoch altered one aspect of his July testimony related to what he knew in 2008 about an email that prompted News Corp. to pay roughly £700,000, or about 1 million, in a settlement to a soccer-union official hacked by the News of the World. Mr. Murdoch authorized the payment in mid-2008. The email—containing transcripts of hacked voice mails—appeared to contradict News Corp.'s longstanding assertion that phone hacking at the tabloid had been isolated to one reporter jailed for the practice in 2007. The email mentioned the names of two other reporters on the tabloid's staff, including reporter Neville Thurlbeck. It is now known as the \\"for Neville\\" email. In July, testifying alongside his father, News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch was asked whether in 2008 he saw or was \\"made aware of the 'for Neville' email, the transcript of hacked voice-mail messages?\\" \\"No, I was not aware of that at the time,\\" he replied. That remark subsequently prompted Messrs. Myler and Crone to release a statement disputing Mr. Murdoch, saying they had informed him of the email. On Thursday, Mr. Murdoch said he had been made aware of the email but that it hadn't been shown to him and he hadn't been briefed on its significance. The email \\"was mentioned to me as evidence that was important with respect to it being a transcript of a voice-mail interception that proved that it was on behalf of the News of the World,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. But he clarified that it was mentioned to him only as a reason why the case should be settled and was never referred to as the \\"for Neville\\" email. \\"The suspicion that perhaps other individuals were involved at the News of the World was not described to me, and the email was not shown to me either,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. Mr. Murdoch has maintained that he became aware of broader problems at the tabloid only late last year, when new information surfaced in civil suits against the company. After the hearing Thursday, a News Corp. spokesman said: \\"Mr. Murdoch's testimony has been clear and consistent that he was told of sufficient evidence to justify settling the case but given no indication that further investigation was necessary.\\" Mr. Crone, the former News of the World lawyer, disputed that characterization. \\"The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning email and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement,\\" Mr. Crone said in a statement to the Guardian newspaper. \\"It seems he now accepts he was told of the email, of the fact that it contained transcripts of voice-mail interceptions and that those interceptions were authorized by the News of the World.\\" The News of the World—which was Britain's most popular weekly before it was closed in July—is the subject of three criminal investigations in the U.K. Legislators on Thursday also questioned Mr. Murdoch about revelations that the tabloid hired a private investigator to follow two lawyers representing phone-hacking victims—surveillance that was commissioned while Mr. Murdoch was overseeing the paper. Mr. Murdoch said he wasn't aware at the time that the surveillance had been commissioned, but he apologized that it had happened. \\"I want to say for the record that it is appalling, and it's something the company should never condone,\\" he said. He said Mr. Crone and another News of the World employee had commissioned the surveillance. Mr. Crone didn't address the surveillance in his statement to the Guardian and didn't respond requests for comment for this article. In testimony in September, Mr. Crone denied ordering the surveillance. Mr. Murdoch didn't work at News Corp. when most of the phone hacking allegedly occurred. He joined the company in late 2007 to run its operations in Europe and Asia, leaving the chief executive post at British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC, a U.K. pay-television company partially owned by News Corp. When he joined News Corp., he took on oversight of the company's British newspapers. Write to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com and Jeanne Whalen at jeanne.whalen@wsj.com ||||| News International chief James Murdoch has rejected suggestions the company operated like the Mafia over the phone hacking scandal. During questioning by MPs, Labour's Tom Watson suggested its UK arm had adopted the \\"omerta\\" code of silence. Mr Murdoch said that was \\"offensive and not true\\" and said he was not made aware in 2008 that phone hacking went beyond one rogue reporter. He also said two former executives had given MPs \\"misleading\\" evidence. The clash with Mr Watson, who has pursued the company over the phone hacking scandal, came halfway through the two and a half hour session. 'Bound by secrecy' Mr Murdoch repeatedly told the committee he had not been made aware of details suggesting phone hacking went beyond Clive Goodman - the former News of the World royal reporter jailed in 2007 - when he authorised a large out-of-court settlement to footballers' union leader Gordon Taylor in June 2008. Mr Watson asked if he was familiar with the code of \\"omerta\\" - where people \\"bound together by secrecy\\" pursued their objectives \\"with no regard for the law\\" and suggested that was \\"an accurate description of News International in the UK\\". You must be the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise Tom Watson MP Mr Murdoch replied: \\"Absolutely not. I frankly think that is offensive and that's not true.\\" The MP said the company was facing a series of allegations around hacking and told him: \\"You must be the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise.\\" Mr Murdoch said that was \\"inappropriate\\" and said while it was a \\"matter of great regret\\" that \\"things went wrong\\" at the newspaper, when evidence had come to light \\"we acted... with great zeal and diligence to get to the bottom of issues to improve the processes to make sure they didn't happen again\\". The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson, in the hearing, reported that a fellow MP said \\"oh come on\\" when Mr Watson made his mafia claim, whilst others on the committee sighed or \\"tutted\\". Out-of-court settlement Earlier in the hearing Mr Murdoch said he had not been shown a copy of the \\"For Neville\\" email - assumed to refer to former NoW chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, which contained transcripts of voicemail messages revealing that Gordon Taylor's phone had been hacked - at a June 2008 meeting with legal manager Tom Crone. At that meeting he agreed to authorise an increase in the out-of-court offer to Mr Taylor. It was not shown to me at the time, nor was it described to me in those terms in any way James Murdoch He said he was given \\"sufficient information to authorise the increase of the settlement offer\\" but added: \\"The nature of the so-called 'For Neville' email... any wider spread or evidence or suspicion of wider spread of wrongdoing - none of these things were mentioned to me.\\" Mr Murdoch denied misleading the committee at a hearing in July, when he said he had not been aware of the email. Two former NoW executives - former editor Colin Myler and former legal manager Tom Crone - have said they \\"did inform\\" Mr Murdoch of it at the time but he told the committee on Thursday: \\"I believe their testimony was misleading.\\" MP Tom Watson said Neville Thurlbeck told him that Mr Crone had said he had shown the email to Mr Murdoch - something Mr Crone did not confirm when he gave evidence to the committee. Mr Murdoch replied: \\"I really can't say what Mr Crone or Mr Thurlbeck may have discussed but my recollection is very clear.\\" He was also asked whether he knew about a legal opinion given to the company by solicitors Farrer and Co in 2008 which stated there is \\"a powerful case that there is (or was) a culture of illegal information access used at NGN [News Group Newspapers] in order to produce stories for publication\\". Mr Murdoch told MPs on Tuesday: \\"It was not shown to me at the time, nor was it described to me in those terms in any way.\\" He said \\"clearly\\" some within the company knew about the legal advice and the \\"for Neville\\" email - but \\"none of those things were made available or discussed with me\\". In a statement on Thursday, Mr Thurlbeck said he had compiled a dossier in his defence which \\"cleared my name and incriminated others\\" and claimed it had been \\"suppressed\\" by the News of the World. Mr Thurlbeck is on police bail after being arrested on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages and has lodged a claim for unfair dismissal against News International. The Sun Mr Murdoch also said the recent arrest of a journalist on the Sun was a matter of \\"great concern\\" but said he had \\"no knowledge\\" of other News International papers being involved in phone hacking, aside from the News of the World He did not rule out having to close The Sun if it was proved to have been involved but said he did not want to prejudge the outcome of investigations: \\"I shouldn't rule any corporate reaction to behaviour of wrongdoing out. That will be a decision taken at the time.\\" He also apologised for The Sun's coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, in which 96 Liverpool football fans died saying: \\"I am aware of the concerns and the hurt it caused and it is something we are very sorry for, and I am as well.\\" Mr Murdoch also said revelations that his company had used a private detective to spy on lawyers acting for phone hacking victims in 2010 was \\"appalling\\" and \\"unacceptable\\" and apologised to committee member Mr Watson, who had also been put under surveillance in the past. He also said the use of private investigators on his company's papers had since been \\"severely restricted\\". In July, the News of the World was shut down after it was found to have hacked into the voicemail messages of prominent people, including murdered teenager Milly Dowler. The Metropolitan Police estimate about 6,000 may have had their phones hacked since 2002.

Choose from: [I] negative [II] positive","response":"[I] negative"},{"question":"I really enjoyed this -- I'm a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at that (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, shall we?). I particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes -- the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each other. It was also really well done aesthetically -- the art direction was really great, and I wish I'd been able to see it on the big screen. The future scenes had a similar feel to Brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling. But perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors I normally don't much like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pitt especially -- I'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act (contrary to what I'd originally thought), but this one really outdid them. I actually found myself asking my friends at one point \\"Are you SURE that's Brad Pitt?\\" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admittedly that may not be saying too much). Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","response":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer expresses appreciation for the time travel theme, the avoidance of paradoxes, the art direction, the similarity to Brazil, and the visual appeal of the movie. Additionally, the reviewer praises the performances of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, particularly highlighting Pitt's memorable acting in the film. Although the reviewer mentions a couple of Terry Gilliam's less successful works, the overall tone of the review is complimentary and appreciative of the mind-bending aspects of the movie in question."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Although man has known asbestos for many hundreds of years, it was not until 160 years ago that it was mined for the first time on the North American continent. H. W. Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers , was responsible for(...) the opening of that first mine. Mr. Johns was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves, which looked much like ordinary work gloves, he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imagine that he had increasing business in asbestos roofing materials. However, because it was very expensive to transport (carry) them from Italy to the United States, Mr. Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein , in the province of Quebec in Canada. Ever since 1881 Quebec has led the world in the production of this unusual mineral, which is made up of magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen. When it is mined, the asbestos is heavy, just as you would expect a mineral to be. When it is separated, a strange thing happens; the rock breaks down into fine, soft, soapy fibres . Scientists do not know why the rock can be separated easily into threads , but they have found thousands of users of this fireproof material, of the so-called \\"cloth of stone\\". Question: Which title best expresses the main idea of this passage? Answer: Answer:","response":"The Early History of Asbestos Mining and Its Many Uses"},{"question":"Tietenkin jos luovumme tilapäisistä toimitiloista, meidän täytyy olla varmoja, että rahoituksen yksityiskohdat on hoidettu kunnolla. Translate to English","response":"Of course, if we give up temporary premises, we must be sure that the financing details are sorted out properly. When considering giving up temporary premises, such as rented office spaces or temporary commercial locations, it is essential to ensure that all financing details have been properly taken care of. This includes examining current financial commitments, future expenses, and overall financial stability of the business. First, evaluate the current financial obligations tied to the temporary premises. This will involve reviewing rental or lease agreements, existing contracts with suppliers, and any related insurance policies. It is essential to understand the terms and conditions associated with these agreements, including potential penalties for early termination or other breaches of contract. Next, consider the costs associated with moving out of the temporary premises and into a more permanent location. This may include expenses like hiring movers, purchasing or leasing new equipment, or renovating the new space to meet the needs of the business. At this stage, it is crucial to obtain accurate estimates of these costs and ensure that adequate funds are available to cover them. Furthermore, assess the overall financial stability of the business and its ability to generate the necessary funds for a smoother transition to a permanent location. This includes reviewing revenue projections, profit margins, and current cash flow. Be sure to take into account any seasonal fluctuations in revenue or other factors that may impact the business's financial status and create a contingency plan for these uncertainties. Finally, explore potential financing options to support this move. It may be helpful to consult with financial advisors, banks, or other lenders to discuss credit lines or loans, or to consider alternative funding methods like crowdfunding or angel investments. In summary, it is essential to be certain that the financial details are properly handled when giving up temporary premises and transitioning to a new, permanent location. Prioritizing financial stability, understanding contractual obligations, estimating costs, and seeking out adequate financing options will ensure a successful relocation."},{"question":"Multi-choice problem: Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? I shaped the dough. Choose from: (1). unacceptable; (2). acceptable;","response":"(2). acceptable The given sentence - \\"I shaped the dough.\\" - is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break it down to understand why: Syntactic acceptability evaluates whether a sentence is structured correctly according to the grammatical rules of a language. In this case, the sentence is structured correctly in English: 1. The subject of the sentence is \\"I,\\" which is a pronoun referring to the speaker. 2. The verb of the sentence is \\"shaped,\\" which is the past tense of the verb \\"to shape.\\" It is an appropriate verb to describe an action that took place in the past. 3. The object of the sentence is \\"the dough,\\" which is a noun phrase comprised of the definite article \\"the\\" followed by the noun \\"dough.\\" The object of the verb \\"shaped\\" refers to the thing that was shaped, which is \\"the dough\\" in this case. Overall, the sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and adheres to the grammatical rules of English. Therefore, it is syntactically acceptable. Semantic acceptability evaluates whether a sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning. The sentence communicates a clear action: the speaker (I) molded or formed the dough into a particular shape. This action is commonly done while making bread, pastries, or other baked goods, and it is a logical statement in the context of food preparation. Thus, the sentence is semantically acceptable as it conveys a clear and coherent meaning. Combining both syntactic and semantic acceptability, the sentence \\"I shaped the dough.\\" is deemed acceptable in both aspects."},{"question":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

It also began with seemingly hopeful news from Madison County Sheriff John Mehr. Related Headlines PHOTOS: Vigil held as search for Noah Chamberlin continues \\"We've got some leads that we have recovered and that's one reason…I'll just tell you that's one reason why we believe he's still there,” Sheriff Mehr said. >> PHOTOS: Vigil held as search for Noah Chamerlin continues Madison County Fire Chief Eric Turner said they have expanded their search grid to beyond 1,000 acres. He added they will take some of the equipment from the search to use for the upcoming potential winter weather. \\"We want to get it out of there before the weather comes in because, like the sheriff alluded to, if we have a bad snowstorm coming here we might need that equipment elsewhere,\\" said Turner. The Madison and Chester County sheriffs added search dogs came from Hunstville, Alabama Wednesday. Mehr explained the dogs have not and may not pick up a scent because two-year-old Noah is so small and not leaving enough of a scent. Chester County Sheriff Blair Weaver said they have new search crews combing through areas they have already searched, in an effort to get a fresh perspective. The same evening, nearly 200 people came together for a prayer vigil for Noah and his family. \\"What if you were in that place? How would you want to be treated and what would you want done? You would want somebody to pray and lift you up, you want somebody to respect privacy,\\" Pastor Andy Morris, who's known the family for six years, told the crowd. Morris said he met with the family just before the vigil. \\"They're still very hopeful, still very faithful, they believe Noah is going to be found,\\" Morris said. \\"This family is heartbroken, this family is searching day and night because they desire for their loved one to come back home.\\" Sheriff Weaver said earlier in the afternoon that the rumors about Noah's family - specifically citing those about his father's criminal history and his grandmother's relationship - need to stop. He said they've looked into the family and added they are good citizens. Weaver also said time spent investigating rumors and speculation is hindering more constructive search efforts. Noah went missing last Thursday afternoon while on a nature walk in the Chester County woods with his grandmother. He was added to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's website this week. ||||| As the search for 2-year-old Noah Chamberlin continues, a community is rallying around the search and praying he is found safe. As the search for 2-year-old Noah Chamberlin continues, a community is rallying around the search and praying he is found safe. Major developments in the search for missing 2-year-old to be announced at 4 p.m. Two-year-old Noah Chamberlin went missing January 14, but the search for him has not let up. Hundreds of law enforcement officials have remained relentless in the search and are swarming Chester County to find the missing boy. The toddler disappeared nearly a week ago while walking with his grandmother and sister in the woods near his home in Pinson, Tennessee, just 11 miles outside of Jackson. Chester County Sheriff Blair Weaver is still calling the search for Noah a search and rescue operation, despite seemingly deadly conditions in the woods Noah was lost in and the search being in its seventh day. Law enforcement officials said during a press conference Wednesday they have reason to believe Noah will be found. \\"We've got some leads we've recovered, and that's one reason we feel he's still there,\\" they said. Leaders would not elaborate on what type of leads or evidence they found. When pressed for how 'realistic' it is Noah will be found alive, investigators responded by saying they would not give up hope. \\"We still believe he is out there and evidently a lot of people do too, because they're coming to help us. We appreciate the support; we appreciate the help,\\" Weaver said. \\"We haven't stopped and we're not going to stop.\\" The Scale of the Search Weaver said they are expecting to scale back the search for Noah on Friday due to inclement weather. Currently, numerous resources and tools have been brought in to assist in the search for Noah, but many of those may be pulled out on Friday to help the county deal with winter weather. Search leaders said even if they have to scale back the amount of equipment being used, that will not signify an end in the search. They are adamant they will not quit searching for Noah. Officials searched throughout the night Tuesday and expanded the area from the 1,000 acres previously searched up through Tuesday. Volunteers The terrain is muddy and one man even flew to Tennessee from California to help officials search for Noah. Volunteers are anxious to get back out to search for Noah. However, officials are not allowing volunteers to return to the search due to the hazards of the weather. Volunteers could get injured if they search during this time. \\"They're doing everything in God's power to find this child,\\" search volunteer Gerald Parish said. \\"Everything that you can think of, they've thought of.\\" Parish has been out searching and has seen it firsthand. He said he's surprised they haven't found Noah, but at the same time, he admits the area he went missing in is vast and hard to search. Suspicions Arise Many people aren't as forgiving as Parish--some are getting suspicious about Noah's disappearance. TBI officials said they are still not doing an investigation and are only assisting in the search. Law enforcement said FBI and TBI have thoroughly vetted family members and have cleared the family. They do not believe the past history has anything to do with the missing child. Noah's father has been in trouble for narcotics in San Bernardino, California, but has no recorded problems in Tennessee. TBI said it can only investigate if a district attorney requests an investigation, which has not happened yet. A district attorney from a different county with zero ties to this case said state law prohibits the Chester County District Attorney from asking for a TBI investigation unless there is reasonable cause to suspect criminal activity. He said being unable to find Noah is not evidence of criminal activity. Additionally, Child Protective Services with the Department of Children's Services said they could not comment on if they have any past history with the family, but they did say they are not currently involved with the family at this time. \\"Sheriff Weaver is telling us that they [family] would prefer not to address the media at this time. Maybe they're waiting for a result,\\" Tom Mapes,Madison County Sheriff's Department, said. While frustration may be mounting for those following the search for Noah, others said every effort possible is being made to bring the little boy home. \\"They're doing everything humanly possible that they can do to find this child,\\" Parish said. Wednesday night prayer vigil for Noah The community came together Wednesday and instead of church services, they gathered for a prayer vigil in Noah's honor. One of the pastors said he would not be surprised if the entire gymnasium at Chester County High School is full of people wanting to pray for the toddler. It's been a tough seven days for the community. People have donated their time and money to help find Noah. Now, they're coming together through faith with an evening prayer vigil. All of them will be praying for a miraculous rescue that would bring Noah home. \\"Regardless of the outcome--trusting in God and trusting that he is in control, that he ultimately has control of Noah's life--that, I believe, is the main source for the comfort of prayer,\\" Pastor John Gaters of Pinson Baptist Church said. While people were praying, law enforcement were searching. At a time when many would be losing hope, the Chester County community is staying faithful to pray for a miracle. \\"The game plan remains the same. The goal is to find him,\\" Mapes said. Many gathered together at the school to pray for Noah and for a safe return and for answers. \\"I'll just be glad when they have answers,\\" Angela Harris said \\"I'm just grateful that the community we live in people come together, they'll help, come together and help,\\" Tim Roland said. The community is also rallying behind Sheriff Blair Weaver, who continues to search relentlessly for the toddler. Weaver said at some point, the search will need to be scaled back and that could begin after Wednesday night. Rough Terrain and Dropping Temperatures The dropping temperatures and rough terrain are making the search for little Noah even more difficult. \\"It is rough country. You could step off into the hole and not even know it's there,\\" Charles Wooley said. Wooley has spent all of his 70-plus years living in the area, and he said sinkholes are an easy way to break a leg. \\"Here's how they normally start: as the water runs, it can get deeper and deeper and deeper,\\" Wooley said. Sinkholes are all over Wooley's farm. He said the woods where Noah went missing has much rougher terrain than his, so navigating over the hills and gulleys and through the trees is tricky. Sometimes the holes are completely covered in grass. He said those woods would be tough to survive in, even for a trained adult. \\"If they dropped in there--and sometimes dirt and mud could fall on them--you'd never know he's there,\\" Wooley said. To make it more difficult, Wooley said it rained in the area Thursday night after Noah went missing. \\"If the soil in the hole underneath is soupy enough, or loose, they could keep on going,\\" Wooley said. That is why he believes thousands of people and dogs with all kinds of equipment have not found Noah in seven days of searching. He is worried it could end up being the reason they never do. \\"Losing a child has to be one of the most horrible things a parent could face,\\" Wooley said. \\"It's just a sad situation and you can't put it any other way.\\" Searchers have been using special cameras to look inside sinkholes for the past few days. But, there are so many of them, it could take a while to check every one. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The perturbation you are referring to, \\"suppose less sources release less gases happens,\\" would have an indirect impact on a step of the ice cube making process. To break it down further, let's analyze the process again and identify where the perturbation might affect the steps: 1. You find an empty ice cube tray: This step is not impacted by the release of gases. 2. You fill the tray with warm water: Whether fewer gases are released or not, this step remains unaffected because you are simply filling the tray, and the source of warm water is not impacted by the changes in gas release. 3. You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degrees Fahrenheit, the freezing point of water: Placing the tray in the freezer is not directly affected by the release of gases. 4. The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid: The freezing process may be indirectly impacted by the release of fewer gases. If we assume that the reduced gas release is due to lower levels of pollution or an overall cleaner environment, it could affect the temperature and humidity of the environment. However, since the water is in a controlled environment (the freezer), there is minimal impact on the freezing process. 5. The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid: This step remains unaffected because the expansion of water during freezing is a characteristic property of water, and less gas release would not impact this property. 6. Because you used warm water, the gases in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses: This is the step where the perturbation could indirectly impact the result. With less gas release, the gases present in the water might also be lower. Although using warm water helps evaporate gases out of the water, with fewer gases being released initially, the clarity of the ice cubes might be even better. So, to summarize, the supposed perturbation of less gas release would indirectly impact a step in the ice cube making process, specifically the portion related to the clarity and quality of the ice cubes. However, in a general sense, the main process of making ice cubes would not be majorly affected by this perturbation."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You will be given a context, a subject and a relation.

He founded the pioneering band Death in 1983. Schuldiner is often referred to as \\"The Godfather of death metal\\", and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that \\"Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\\" Schuldiner was born on May 13, 1967, on Long Island, New York to a Jewish father of Austrian descent and a mother from the American South, a convert to Judaism. Both of his parents were teachers. In 1968, his family moved to Florida. Schuldiner was the youngest of three children: he had an older brother named Frank and an older sister named Bethann. He started playing guitar at the age of 9; his 16-year-old brother had died and his parents bought him a guitar, thinking it would help with his grief. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\", which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely, until his parents saw an electric guitar at a yard sale and bought it for him. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument. After getting amps, he never stopped playing, writing and teaching himself. Schuldiner was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar, but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens. Schuldiner was originally inspired by Metallica, Iron Maiden, Kiss and classical jazz, among others. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM - New Wave of British Heavy Metal - and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortilege as his personal favorite metal group. Slayer, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond and Metallica were later influences he would apply more to his own band. Later in his career, Schuldiner frequently cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, Coroner and Queensryche as influences. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner's mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap. He also enjoyed jazz and classical music in addition to metal and British alternative acts such as Lush. Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education, and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook.

This includes, depending on the particular manner of practice, the language, race, culture, religion, and customs of the \\"nation\\" in its primal sense of those who were \\"born\\" within its culture. This form of nationalism arose in reaction to dynastic or imperial hegemony, which assessed the legitimacy of the state from the \\"top down\\", emanating from a monarch or other authority, which justified its existence. Such downward-radiating power might ultimately derive from a god or gods (see the divine right of kings and the Mandate of Heaven). - Josef Daniel Stenbäck (May 2, 1854, Alavus April 27, 1929, Helsinki) was a Finnish church architect and engineer. He designed 35 churches for Finland, which until 1917 was part of the Russian Empire. Four of the churches were located in the current Russian territory of the Karelian Isthmus, ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944. Stenbäck's churches represent Romantic nationalism or Gothic Revival.

Question 2: How do I install fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac? Pick from: A). no; B). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"To answer both questions thoroughly, I will address them one at a time. Question 1: Why does Photoshop support only Zawgyi-One font for Myanmar but not Unicode? Step 1: Research on the issue of Photoshop supporting Zawgyi-One font and Unicode for Myanmar. Justification: To understand why Photoshop supports only Zawgyi-One font for Myanmar but not Unicode, I need to gather information on the topic. According to the information gathered, the support for fonts in Photoshop, including Myanmar fonts such as Zawgyi-One and Unicode, is not determined by Photoshop itself. Instead, it depends on the installed fonts on the operating system (Windows or Mac). In some cases, users have experienced compatibility problems with Unicode fonts in Photoshop. However, these issues do not necessarily imply that Photoshop exclusively supports only Zawgyi-One and not Unicode fonts. Question 2: How do I install fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac? Step 1: Locate the desired font files. Justification: In order to install a font in Photoshop CS5 for Mac, we need to have the font files that need to be installed on the computer. Step 2: Close Photoshop if it's running. Justification: Closing Photoshop before installing fonts will ensure that the program will recognize the new fonts once it's started again. Step 3: Double-click the downloaded font file. Justification: This opens the Font Book application on Mac, which is used to manage and install fonts. Step 4: Click on the \\"Install Font\\" button. Justification: This installs the font on the Mac operating system, making it available to use in all applicable programs, including Photoshop. Step 5: Restart Photoshop. Justification: Restarting Photoshop after installing the font will ensure that it recognizes the newly-installed font. Pick from: A). no; B). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same? Answer: A). no. Justification: The first question relates to the compatibility issue of certain Myanmar fonts in Photoshop, while the second question is about the process of installing new fonts in Photoshop CS5 for Mac. These two questions share a connection (Myanmar fonts in Photoshop), but they address distinct aspects, making them different from each other."},{"question":"Test for natural language inference.

I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options). The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now. Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food. My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record. I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.

The crux of the court case, therefore, revolves around whether \\"Blurred Lines\\" unlawfully borrowed key aspects from \\"Got to Give It Up\\" and whether Sony-ATV's handling of the matter with respect to their dual-sided clientele constitutes a significant breach of fiduciary duty. The implications of such a case are immense, reaching far beyond the involved parties and potentially affecting the entire music industry. As the copyright infringement allegations against Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr. continue to surface, the intricacies of each claim draw considerable attention to the ongoing debate surrounding the originality in music, the potential line between inspiration and theft, and the responsibility of publishers in safeguarding the rights of their clients. The Gaye family's impassioned battle to preserve the legacy of their father's work is indicative of deeper tensions within the artistic community, where the line between acceptable borrowing of musical elements and plagiarism remains fraught with ambiguity. This highly publicized case has the potential to set a precedent for future copyright disputes, as it raises questions about the legal safeguards that should be implemented to prevent publishers from becoming caught in the middle of conflicting interests. In particular, the court proceedings may offer clarity on the potential consequences of dual representation by a single publishing house, emphasizing the need for more robust guidelines and transparent negotiations to ensure equal protection for all parties involved. Beyond the legal and financial implications, the impact of this case on the careers of Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr., as well as the reputation of Michael Jackson's estate and Sony-ATV, is also notable. With intertwining interests and damages that could amount to millions of dollars, the outcome of this dispute will likely reverberate throughout the industry and may lead to further examination and potential reform of copyright laws and music publishing practices. As the case unfolds, it is clear that the Gaye family remains steadfast in their pursuit of justice in defense of their father's legacy. Embroiled in contentious legal battles and public scrutiny, the underlying message is that creative integrity and the preservation of artistic works are essential in an industry that thrives on the power of music.

Q: Passage: According to the Yuanshi, the Yuan fleet set out with an estimated 15,000 Mongol and Chinese soldiers and 1,600-8,000 Korean soldiers in 300 large vessels and 400-500 smaller craft along with several thousand sailors, although figures vary considerably depending on the source and many modern historians consider the numbers exaggerated. The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian, then the center of China's maritime trade. They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5, 1274. Sō Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement. The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he killed himself after his unit was defeated. The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay, a short distance from Dazaifu, the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the \\"First Battle of Hakata Bay\\". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong. Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force, while the Japanese Hachiman Gudokun describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1. Conlan argues that the Yuanshi's account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size. Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each .

Translate to English","response":"Intervention by community institutions, namely the Commission, the Council, and also the Parliament, is also the only way to strictly address this process without raising accusations of interference in the internal democratic process of the countries concerned. This is due to the supranational nature of community institutions, particularly the Commission and Parliament. In other words, the involvement of these European institutions is key to addressing certain issues within member countries without directly interfering with their internal politics. The Commission, Council, and Parliament all hold specific powers and responsibilities within the European Union, which enable them to ensure adherence to EU laws, policies, and standards. The European Commission, for instance, is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and overseeing the application of EU treaties. In this capacity, it can take action to address any violations or discrepancies among the member states. Similarly, the European Parliament serves as a democratic forum where members represent their respective citizens, ensuring that their interests are considered and acted upon. The Council of the European Union, on the other hand, represents the interests of EU member governments and works with the Parliament to coordinate policies, adopt legislation, and negotiate international agreements. In this role, it has the power to ensure that actions taken by member states align with EU guidelines and overarching objectives. By utilizing these supranational institutions, the European Union can address various issues within its member countries without directly intervening in their internal decision-making processes. Such an approach respects the sovereignty of each nation while also fostering cooperation, unity, and accountability within the Union. This helps to maintain a balance between the need for individual autonomy within member states and the overall cohesion and effectiveness of the EU as a whole."},{"question":"Sentence: 1099 Figneria was formerly known as \\"1928 RQ\\".

Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. Symphonies are scored for string (violin, viola, cello and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30100 musicians. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony). - Sound recording and reproduction is an electrical, mechanical, electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording. - Chamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instrumentstraditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances. - (Franz) Joseph Haydn (31 March 173231 May 1809) was a prolific Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet\\". - A piano trio is a group of piano and two other instruments, usually a violin and a cello, or a piece of music written for such a group. It is one of the most common forms found in classical chamber music. The term can also refer to a group of musicians who regularly play this repertoire together; for a number of well-known piano trios, see below. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Edison Records was one of the earliest record labels which pioneered sound recording and reproduction and was an important player in the early recording industry. - The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \\"The Oxford Companion to Music\\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \\"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\\" - The Haydn Quartet , later known as the Hayden Quartet , was one of the most popular recording close harmony quartets in the early twentieth century . It was originally formed in 1896 as the Edison Quartet to record for Edison Records ; it took its new name when recording for other companies . The name was a homage to Joseph Haydn , the classical composer ; the spelling was later revised to Hayden , which reflects the way it was pronounced . The group disbanded in 1914 . - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'choir'. A:","response":"There is no specific entity mentioned in the given paragraphs that has a direct relation 'instance of' with 'choir'. However, it is mentioned that some symphonies contain vocal parts like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In this context, you could consider the vocal component or singers in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as an entity related to a choir, since choirs consist of singers performing vocal music together."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

His strategy was to pick off Siam's peripheral regions rather than launch a full-scale invasion. On 30 November 1613, he sent a small army of 4,000 to drive out the Siamese from upper Tenasserim coast. On 26 December 1613, the army defeated the Siamese at Tavoy. The Burmese followed down to Tenasserim port itself. But the Burmese were driven back with heavy losses by the wealthy port's Portuguese broadsides in March 1614. The Siamese tried to retake Tavoy but failed. Anaukpetlun then switched theatres to Lan Na, which like Martaban before was only a nominal vassal of Siam. His armies of 17,000 invaded Lan Na on 30 April 1614 from Martaban in the south and Mone in the north. Lan Na's ruler, Thado Kyaw, desperately sought help. Help came from Lan Xang, not his overlord Siam. Despite the logistical troubles and the rainy season conditions, the Burmese armies finally achieved encirclement of Lan Na and Lan Xang forces in the Chiang Mai and Lanphun pocket in August 1614. After nearly five months, on 22 December 1614, the city surrendered. Siam would not make any attempts to recover Lan Na until 1663.

It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated. But, can be any colour. - The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century. The breed is named after the person credited with the creation of this type of dog, the Reverend John \\"Jack\\" Russell. It is the recognised conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Russell Terrier. In America, it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997. The name was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name. - A foxhound is a type of large hunting hound bred for strong hunting instincts, great energy, and, like all scent hounds, a keen sense of smell. In fox hunting, the foxhound's namesake, packs of foxhounds track quarry, followedusually on horsebackby the hunters, sometimes for several miles at a stretch; moreover, foxhounds also sometimes guard sheep and houses. - Fox Terriers are two different breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier. Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century from a handful of dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland. - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among: - Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping animals, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A working terrier is a small type of dog which pursues its quarry into the earth. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the name dates back to at least 1440, derived from early modern French \\"(chien) terrier\\" - from the medieval Latin \\"terrarius\\" from the Latin \\"terra\\" (earth). - A conformation show, also referred to as a \\"breed show\\", is a kind of dog show in which a judge familiar with a specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for how well the dogs \\"conform\\" to the established breed type for their breed, as described in a breed's individual breed standard. - A landrace is a domesticated, locally adapted, traditional variety of a species of animal or plant that has developed over time, through adaptation to its natural and cultural environment of agriculture and pastoralism, and due to isolation from other populations of the species. Landraces are generally distinguished from cultivars, and from breeds in the standardized sense, although the term landrace breed is sometimes used as distinguished from the term \\"standardized breed\\" when referring to cattle. The \\"-race\\" in this word refers to the taxonomic definition of \\"race\\" in biology, not the ethnographic sense of the word. - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. - The red fox (\\"Vulpes vulpes\\"), largest of the true foxes, has the greatest geographic range of all members of the Carnivora family, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, North America and Eurasia. It is listed as least concern by the IUCN. Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia, it is included among the list of the \\"world's 100 worst invasive species\\". - Fox hunting is an activity involving the tracking, chase, and sometimes killing of a fox, traditionally a red fox, by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds, and a group of unarmed followers led by a \\"master of foxhounds\\" (\\"master of hounds\\"), who follow the hounds on foot or on horseback. - Scent hounds (or scenthounds) are a type of hound that primarily hunts by scent rather than sight. These breeds are hunting dogs and are generally regarded as having some of the most sensitive noses among canines. - The Russell Terrier is a predominantly white working terrier with an instinct to hunt prey underground . The breed was derived from the Reverend John Russell 's working terrier strains that were used in the 19th century for fox hunting . The Reverend 's fox working strains were much smaller than the Show Fox Terrier and remained working terriers . The size of the Russell Terrier ( 10 \`\` to 12 '' ) combined with a small flexible , spannable chest makes it an ideal size to work efficiently underground .

The city of Miami is the second-most populous city in Florida, after Jacksonville. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Miami was estimated at 442,241 in 2021. In terms of population ranking among U.S. cities, it is important to note that city population rankings change frequently due to population growth patterns and the incorporation of new cities. As of September 2021, Miami ranked as the 44th most populous city in the United States. However, when considering the larger Miami metropolitan area (which encompasses Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties), the population is significantly higher. As stated in the provided information, this metropolitan area is home to more than 5.5 million people, making it the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States, and the largest metropolitan area in the Southeastern United States. So, to answer the question, \\"Where does Miami rank in population among US cities?\\" more directly: Miami, as a city, ranks 44th in population among U.S. cities, while the Miami metropolitan area is the seventh-largest in the country and the largest in the Southeastern United States."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Marina and the Diamonds' last record went straight to number one, but it left her creatively dissatisfied.\\"","response":"Title: \\"Marina and the Diamonds Finds Creative Redemption Despite Chart-Topping Success\\" Step 1: Begin by introducing Marina and the Diamonds and her latest record's success.

Is \\"Genetics compression algorithms are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype.\\" the correct answer?","response":"No, the statement provided does not directly answer the question. The question is asking about the encoding that reduces heterogeneity of a dataset by sorting Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The correct answer is: The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an encoding method that reduces the heterogeneity of a dataset by sorting SNPs. Step 1: Identifying the purpose The purpose of the encoding method in the context of the question is to reduce the heterogeneity of a dataset by sorting SNPs. Step 2: Identifying the appropriate method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that transforms data by reducing its dimensions while retaining the maximum amount of variance in the dataset. Step 3: Apply PCA to the dataset with SNPs PCA is applied to the dataset containing SNPs in order to reduce and sort the data, thus reducing its heterogeneity. This is achieved by calculating the principal components that represent the largest amount of variance in the dataset. Step 4: Justification for using PCA PCA is effective in reducing the heterogeneity of a dataset by sorting SNPs because it simplifies complex datasets and helps identify patterns or associations between SNPs that may otherwise be difficult to discern. By reducing the dimensions and focusing on the major sources of variation, PCA can improve the analysis and interpretation of genetic data."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: We open to Charlie (Hugh Jackman) driving through the country to a nice mellow song, pulling up a trailer to a county fair.

I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

In a filing released after market hours on Monday, the billionaire investor revealed a 9.3% passive stake in Nuance Communications, a voice-recognition company reportedly behind Apple’s Siri. Shares in the company surged in after-hours trading. Icahn has amassed a 29.3 million-share position in the company, worth more than 591 million at Monday’s closing price of 20.18. The stock closed the day flat. News of Icahn’s position came a couple of weeks after private equity shop Warburg Pincus disclosed a 14.6% stake. Nuance, which had a market capitalization of 6.4 billion by the end of the trading day on Monday, develops voice-recognition technology. Reportedly, Apple’s Siri is powered by Nuance’s software. Voice-recognition technology, which has been around for quite some time, could potentially revolutionize human interaction with gadgets and digital devices, as improved hardware and software pave the way for smoother conversations with machines. Under Marissa Mayer’s leadership, Yahoo recently acquired news app Summly for 30 million, which, according to 17-year-old founder and CEO, “uses a genetic algorithm to mimic how a human actually thinks.” With Google reportedly working on “intelligent computers [that] understand human language,” some like Upstart’s Michael del Castillo suggest the move to bridge the communication gap between people and their devices is here to stay. Icahn’s investment is the latest in a series of moves by the billionaire, who Forbes just dubbed the richest man on Wall Street. At 77, Icahn is at the top of his game, as my colleagues Nathan Vardi and Steve Bertoni explained in their latest cover story on the famed activist, Icahn Unleashed. Investors were following Icahn’s lead in post-market trading in New York. By 5:49 PM, the stock was up 9% to 22.00. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"A man named Carl Icahn, who is very good at investing money, bought a lot of shares (pieces of ownership) in a company called Nuance Communications. This company helps make a talking computer called Siri that works with Apple's devices like iPhones and iPads. Since Carl Icahn bought shares, other people think it's a good idea too, and the price of the shares is going up.

A. sew B. create art C. express yourself D. sing and dance E. write The best answer is A:","response":"The best answer to this question is indeed a matter of perspective, as everyone has unique talents and the term \\"creativity\\" can mean different things to different people. However, considering the options provided, the best answer is B. create art. To elaborate on why this answer may be the best, it's important to understand that creativity is an innate quality that everyone possesses. Artists, throughout history, have demonstrated an impressive ability to showcase their creative expression through various art forms. Whether it's painting, sculpting, drawing, or any other visual art, the ability to create art has often been regarded as a highly desirable skill that not many can master. Although all the options listed portray some level of creativity, creating art professionally requires a deeper commitment to honing one's skills and talents. Artists must have a strong sense of imagination, a natural inclination towards aesthetics, and a keen understanding of human emotions. By dedicating their time to create evocative and meaningful pieces of art, artists can make a lasting impact on society as a whole. Option A, sewing, is indeed a creative talent that many people possess. However, it is typically seen more as a craft, hobby, or necessary skill for daily life rather than a vocation that relies primarily on creative expression. Sewing can also be quite functional and not always considered an art form. Option C, expressing oneself, is a basic human need but is not always synonymous with making a living. While one could argue that being a public speaker, influencer, or life coach falls under this category, they are not always associated with creativity in the same way as those mentioned in creating art or writing. Option D, singing and dancing, can be considered creative professions for those exceptionally gifted in these areas. However, these talents are often seen as more related to performance arts rather than original creative output, as performers often interpret and share the creative work of others such as singers performing songs written by someone else or dancers performing choreographed pieces created by a choreographer. Option E, writing, is also a form of creative expression and plays a crucial role in educating, entertaining, and inspiring people. However, writing often requires a different set of skills, such as analytical and communication abilities. Furthermore, writing can encompass various styles and purposes, from technical and functional writings to fictional storytelling, which diversify the idea of creativity within the writing profession. In conclusion, while all these options show different aspects of creativity, creating art involves a higher level of self-expression and emotional exploration, allowing the artist to make a living by creating lasting, impactful work. Therefore, the best answer is B. create art."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: Which editor for United Press International was played by Dane William DeHaan?

A: no Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"A rabbi would not worship martyrs killed by Ranavalona I for several reasons, which can be understood after providing some context on rabbis, martyrs, and Ranavalona I. 1. Rabbis: Rabbis are Jewish religious leaders and teachers who are knowledgeable in Jewish law, tradition, and the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). They often lead Jewish congregations, provide spiritual guidance, and perform various religious duties. A key point here is that rabbis are specifically Jewish in their religious affiliation and beliefs. 2. Martyrs: In general, a martyr is a person who is killed or suffers persecution for their religious beliefs or convictions. Martyrs are often venerated by their religious communities for their unwavering faith and sacrifice. However, the specific beliefs and identities of the martyrs matter when it comes to who would worship or venerate them. 3. Ranavalona I: Ranavalona I was a Queen of Madagascar who ruled from 1828 to 1861. She is known for her policies of isolationism and self-reliance, as well as her harsh persecution of various religious groups, including Christians. The martyrs referred to in your question are likely those who were persecuted and killed by Ranavalona I for their Christian faith. Now that we understand the context, we can better understand why a rabbi would not worship the martyrs killed by Ranavalona I. Firstly, since rabbis are Jewish leaders, they follow and teach the principles and beliefs of Judaism, whereas the martyrs killed by Ranavalona I were Christians. This difference in religious beliefs and affiliations makes it highly unlikely for a rabbi to worship Christian martyrs. Secondly, worship in Jewish tradition is generally reserved for God alone. While some individuals may be honored or remembered for their acts of devotion or righteousness, this is not the same as worship, which in Jewish theology is reserved for the divine. In conclusion, a rabbi would not worship martyrs killed by Ranavalona I due to the differences in religious beliefs between Judaism and Christianity, as well as the Jewish theological concept that worship should be reserved for God alone."},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What position at the paper would Henry be leaving if he went to work at the New York Sentinel?, using the article: The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictional New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. The paper's owner, Graham Keighley, faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark, the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a fellow Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel, another fictional newspaper (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and Sun columnist Michael McDougal. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks.

Mass deaths at about 25 separate colonies have been reported since the weekend, including at Mt Ommaney, Redbank, Boonah, Palmwoods, Laidley and Gatton. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state. \\"The heatwave was basically a catastrophe for all the bat colonies in south-east Queensland,\\" he said. \\"That's obviously going to have a pretty disturbing impact on those colonies and those colonies are vital to our ecosystem.\\" The smell of bat carcasses has caused problems for locals. The Scenic Rim Regional Council, west of Brisbane, has organised rubbish collectors to clear up the carcasses of about 2,000 bats. Residents near Boonah's Athol Terrace lookout say they have been putting up with the stench of the dead animals for four days. Hundreds of bats also lie dead in trees and nearby bushes, and are being eaten by maggots. The council today advised local residents it will not send workers into nearby bushland to collect the remaining bat carcasses, as it could cause further disruption to the nearby colony. One resident has told the ABC she is receiving anti-viral treatment after being scratched by a baby bat while clearing the dead animals out of her tree with a rake. Further north, Lockyer Valley Regional Council says it also faces a massive task of cleaning up thousands of dead bats from around Laidley and Gatton. Sunshine Coast Regional Council has sent workers out to collect thousands more dead bats near Palmwoods. At least 16 people across south-east Queensland are receiving anti-viral treatment after coming into close contact with a bat. Queensland Health is advising people not to touch the animals and to call authorities for help in clearing them away. Sammy Ringer from Bat Rescue echoed those concerns, saying it was best to call a wildlife volunteer or a vet. \\"Don't touch them, they're stressed,\\" she said. \\"If they do bite or scratch you and break the skin you can get a vaccination, you can get a shot for the lyssavirus.\\" Topics: local-government, phenomena, environmental-impact, boonah-4310, southport-4215, maroochydore-4558 First posted ||||| Queensland heatwave: Brisbane set to roast as weekend temperatures soar Updated The scorching heatwave gripping much of Queensland is being felt in Brisbane today, with residents set to roast in temperatures of up to 41 degrees Celsius.

By 1:00pm, the temperature had risen to 38C, although the apparent temperature was 41C. Queensland's interior has been sweltering through record-breaking heat in recent days, along with parts of Central Australia and north-western New South Wales. The heatwave continued as a Bureau of Meteorology report revealed 2013 was the hottest year on record in Australia. The mass of hot air causing the extreme weather again led to searing temperatures in central and western Queensland on Friday. St George topped the temperature list with 47.2C, while Winton and Longreach also had scorchers at 46.4C and 46.3C respectively. Charleville followed on 46.1C, while Blackall, Roma and Thargomindah all recorded temperatures just above 45C. Brisbane's top for Friday was 34.3C, but the mercury is predicted to reach 41C today as northerly winds push the heatwave south.

Queenslanders have also been urged to put their health first during the current heatwave. Last summer, paramedics responded to more than 350 cases of heat-related illness across the state. Steven Clarke from Queensland Ambulance says drinking plenty of water is the key. Mr Clarke says families should ensure loved ones are coping with the heat, with the elderly particularly vulnerable. \\"For the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, especially with kidney problems, diabetic problems, obese people, they need to take extra care,\\" he said. \\"Probably a critical point to make is family need to check their loved ones - grandad and grandma living on their own - they need to ring them up, they need to go around and visit them and make sure they are doing the right thing.

Title: slangman guide to biz speak 1 Review: This book has few useful American slang words.There are way too many repeatations an redundancy spread over 240 pages.The information contained can be easily presented in some fifty pages or less.This book is grossly overprized. Answer: Answer:","response":"Based on the review provided, it seems that the product review is mostly negative. Below is an evaluation of some key points mentioned in the review to understand the reason behind this assessment: 1. Limited useful content: The reviewer states that the book provides only a few helpful American slang words. This indicates that the content of the book is not as informative or valuable as the reader was expecting, which contributes to the overall negative review. 2. Repetitions and redundancy: The reviewer expresses disappointment in the repetitive nature of the content within the book. They believe that there is a significant amount of redundancy spread over 240 pages, which likely makes the book less engaging and useful for the reader. 3. Length of the book: According to the review, the content in this book could have been presented in a much shorter format, such as 50 pages. This highlights that the reviewer finds the length of the book unnecessary and likely makes it difficult for the reader to extract valuable information quickly. 4. Overpriced: Finally, the reviewer claims that the book is grossly overpriced. This shows that the reviewer believes the value of the book does not match up with its cost, and they are not satisfied with the price-to-quality ratio of this particular product. In summary, while there is some mention of useful American slang words, the overall feedback in this product review is overwhelmingly negative. The presence of limited valuable content, redundancy, an unnecessarily extended length, and a high price tag make this review primarily negative. It is important to consider these factors when evaluating the overall sentiment of the review."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question.

Generally speaking, of the three key strands of Orthodox Judaism, Haredi Orthodox and Hasidic Orthodox Jews are at best ambivalent towards the ideology of Zionism and the creation of the State of Israel, and there are many groups and organisations who are outspokenly anti-Zionistic, seeing the ideology of Zionism as diametrically opposed to the teaching of the Torah, and the Zionist administration of the State of Israel, with its emphasis on militarism and nationalism, as destructive of the Judaic way of life.

Article: We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do.

Title: The Watch Movie plot: In the town of Glenview, Ohio, Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is an active participant in the community and senior manager of the local Costco store. His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcÃ©. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan (apparently) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch theorizes that the aliens are stealing their victims' skin and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty), and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and revealing that it may cause her to leave. Evan suspects that one of his neighbors is an alien (due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he always seems to be watching him). As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's...

The original members of the group were lead singer Bryan Abrams (born November 16, 1969), second tenor Mark Calderon (born September 27, 1970), second tenor Sam Watters (born July 23, 1970) and baritone Kevin Thornton (born June 17, 1969). They formed in 1985 and broke up in 1998 before reuniting in 2010, with various lineups since. As of 2016, they operate as a trio with Abrams, Calderon and Adam Emil. Kevin Thornton left the group in October 1998 to pursue the ministry. He became a licensed minister, and has since served as an evangelist, youth pastor and worship leader at his home church, Without Walls Church, in Fort Worth, Texas. He operates Kevin Thornton Ministries in Texas. In 2008, he released a solo album, Conversions, blending contemporary hip-hop/rap with gospel and soul music. Sam Watters pursued a career as a record producer, achieving success producing for Jessica Simpson, Celine Dion, Fantasia, Anastacia, Natasha Bedingfield, Kelly Clarkson, 98 Degrees, Blake Lewis, and others. Watters is a member of the production/songwriting team The Runaways, which also includes Rico Love, Wayne Wilkins, Ryan Tedder, and Louis Biancaniello. He married R&B singer and former American Idol contestant Tamyra Gray in 2006. Mark Calderon worked with artists such as Stevie Brock, whose 2002 remake of \\"All 4 Love\\" reached number 1 on the Disney charts; and with IPV, who is signed with Wright Entertainment and had songs played on the television series House and Knight Rider. In 1992, Calderon married Lisa Smedley-Calderon, who was formerly Color Me Badd's fashion stylist. In 2001, Bryan Abrams released a solo album entitled Welcome to Me.

Premise: Three men playing golf close to the water. From the premise, we can gather the following information: 1. There are three men involved. 2. These men are playing golf. 3. They are playing close to a body of water. Hypothesis: Three men playing golf close to the river. In the hypothesis, we can identify the following information: 1. There are three men involved. 2. These men are playing golf. 3. They are playing close to a river, which is a specific type of body of water. Let's now compare both statements to see if the information aligns. Points 1 and 2 of both the premise and hypothesis are identical, so there are no discrepancies there. The main difference between the premise and the hypothesis lies in the description of the water body mentioned. The premise states that the men are playing close to \\"water,\\" which may include various types of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, or even a pond. The hypothesis, on the other hand, narrows it down to a specific type of water body - a river. Given that the premise only provides information about the vicinity to water, we cannot conclusively narrow down its nature (i.e., whether it's a river or any other type of water body) solely based on the premise. Consequently, we must consider other factors or gather more context to definitively accept or reject this hypothesis. In summary, based on the given premise alone, we cannot conclusively deduce the hypothesis that the three men are playing golf close to a river. The premise only establishes that they are playing near water, without providing more detail about the kind of water body involved.

Our job is to find the value of 'h'. Here's the problem: -523*h - 10104 = 252*h - 104*h + 1303 First, let's look at the right side of the equation (the part after the equal sign). We notice there are two 'h' terms: 252*h and -104*h. We can combine them by adding them together. 252*h - 104*h = 148*h Now, our equation looks like this: -523*h - 10104 = 148*h + 1303 Next, we want to move the 'h' terms to one side of the equation and the numbers to the other side. To do this, we'll add 523*h to both sides of the equation to move -523*h to the right side: -523*h + 523*h - 10104 = 148*h + 523*h + 1303 This simplifies to: -10104 = 671*h + 1303 Now, let's move the 1303 to the left side. We can do this by subtracting 1303 from both sides of the equation: -10104 - 1303 = 671*h + 1303 - 1303 This simplifies to: -11407 = 671*h We're almost done! Now, we just need to find the value of 'h'. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 671: -11407 ÷ 671 = 671*h ÷ 671 This simplifies to: -17 = h So, the value of 'h' is -17.

Here is a hypothesis: Without it, the country would be going backward. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To determine if the hypothesis can be taken as true given the truth of the premise, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, and whether they are logically connected. Premise: Prosperous and colorful, it is well prepared to take the country into the next millennium. The premise states that there is a subject (most likely a country or a government) that is prosperous and colorful, meaning it is successful or wealthy and features a diverse culture or society. Additionally, this subject is well-prepared to lead or support the country into the next millennium, signifying positive progress and development. Hypothesis: Without it, the country would be going backward. The hypothesis posits that if this subject in question were not present, the country would regress or move away from progress and development. To understand if the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, it is important to consider the implications of the premise. If the subject under discussion is well-prepared to lead the country into the next millennium, it suggests that the subject plays a significant role in the country's development and progress. Taken together, the country's future progress is reliant, to some extent, on the subject's presence. Conversely, the absence of this subject could potentially lead to stagnation or a slower rate of progress. If this subject's role in the country's development is integral enough, then its absence may lead to the country moving backward. However, this would depend on the extent of the subject's importance and the country's ability to adapt and find alternative routes of progress in its absence. Based on the above analysis, if the premise is true, it is possible (but not absolutely assured) that the hypothesis is also true. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of logical connection and dependence, but the truth of the hypothesis would depend on the specific context and situation, and whether or not the subject's role in the country's progress is indispensable. If the subject's removal indeed leads to the country falling behind or going backward, then the truth of the hypothesis is supported by the premise. However, if alternative paths for the country's progress can be established without this subject, the truth of the hypothesis may be called into question."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence, generate what should be the most likely next statement.

Justification: The answer \\"no\\" stands as a strong rebuttal to this question, emphasizing the importance of individual responsibility and collective action to address the ongoing issue of climate change. Failing to address this global issue could lead to devastating consequences for both human and natural environments, including increased natural disasters, destruction of ecosystems, and widespread disruption of economies. Furthermore, the idea of not addressing climate change stands in opposition to a growing consensus among the scientific community and governments that immediate and proactive action is necessary to mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects. Significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adaptation efforts are critical in preventing a global crisis. By stating \\"no\\" to the question, we're advocating for the vital need to continue focusing on combating climate change, understanding that the consequences of inaction would be detrimental to our planet and future generations."},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Visa Europe settled with regulators on debit card fees in 2010. Group says it is disappointed with EU Commission's 'confrontational' approach. EU antitrust breaches can incur fines up to 10 per cent of global turnover.","response":"Title: Visa Europe Faces Regulatory Challenges Over Debit Card Fees Introduction Visa Europe, one of the leading payment processing companies, is under scrutiny as it grapples with the European Union regulators concerning its debit card fees. Although the company has tried to make amends by agreeing to certain terms, the recent confrontational approach by the European Commission has raised concerns among all stakeholders. Background Back in 2010, Visa Europe tried to address the issues surrounding its debit card fees by settling with regulators. By agreeing on various terms, the company hoped that it would avoid any more disputes about the charges that are imposed to millions of consumers who use their services. However, it seems that the situation is far from resolved, as the European Commission has recently adopted a more confrontational stance towards Visa Europe. Visa Europe's disappointment with the EU Commission Visa Europe has expressed its disappointment with the European Commission's confrontational approach towards their debit card fee policies. The company's representatives have argued that the aggressive stance of the regulatory body could potentially derail the progress made since the initial agreement in 2010. Moreover, Visa Europe believes that the efforts they have made to comply with the regulations have not been fully acknowledged by the regulators. EU antitrust breaches and potential fines When it comes to EU antitrust breaches, the stakes are high, as companies that violate these regulations can incur significant fines. In fact, charges can be as high as 10 per cent of their global turnover, which is by no means an insubstantial sum. Therefore, any organization, including Visa Europe, needs to take these regulations seriously and address the issues promptly and efficiently. The impact on consumers and businesses The ongoing tension between Visa Europe and the European Commission poses potential risks for consumers and businesses alike. As the payment processing landscape is continuously changing, it is essential that all stakeholders work together to promote a fair and transparent pricing environment. This would not only ensure the protection of consumer rights but also encourage healthy competition among payment processing companies. Looking ahead The dispute between Visa Europe and the European Commission regarding debit card fees highlights the complexities that arise in the modern financial landscape. On one hand, payment processing companies need to generate revenue to support their services; on the other hand, regulators must safeguard consumers and ensure fair competition among businesses. It is crucial that all parties involved, including the European regulatory bodies, try to collaborate on finding a balance that benefits everyone. Only then can the future of payment processing in Europe remain secure and promote innovation and efficiency within the industry. In the meantime, Visa Europe must continue to engage with regulators and demonstrate its commitment to providing transparent and fair services to its customers. Conclusion The ongoing regulatory challenges faced by Visa Europe is a testament to the dynamic nature of the financial and payment processing industry. With the European Commission adopting a confrontational approach, it is now crucial for both parties to find a mutually beneficial solution to ensure the continued growth and stability of the European payment processing market. Furthermore, striking a balance between revenue generation and consumer protection will likely be at the heart of any resolution concerning debit card fees."},{"question":"Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Charles Manson loved the smell of apple candles.\\" Options: - yes - no Your chain-of-thought:","response":"1.

Fluent in Romanian and German and having studied chemical engineering, he is parachuted into Romania to assume the identity of Captain Jan Tartu, a member of the fascist Iron Guard. He makes his way to Czechoslovakia to steal the formula of a new Nazi poison gas and sabotage the chemical plant where it is being manufactured.

He is billeted in the house of Anna Palacek (Phyllis Morris) and her daughter Pavla (Glynis Johns), who works in the plant; also living there are German Inspector Otto Vogel (Walter Rilla) and the lovely Maruschuka Lanova (Valerie Hobson), who lives well by making herself popular with the German officers. That day Pavla shoots a German who earlier had had the man she loved executed. Tartu provides her with an alibi, winning her trust, and then reveals himself as a secret agent. Needing to get into the chemical plant, he asks her help to contact the Czech underground, and is surprised when she contrives for him and Maruschuka to go on a date. They talk guardedly but make it clear they are both working against the Nazis. At work the next day, Pavla is seen attempting sabotage. She whispers to Tartu to protect himself by denouncing her.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity.

His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive.

Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible.

Answer:","response":"No."},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. I am facing a new situation today: Greg is an environmental scientist. He wants to know how earth's atmosphere differed in two different time. To that end, he selected two time periods, time A and time B. Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B? The answer to this question is:","response":"Time B would have more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere compared to Time A. This is due to the increased usage of fossil fuels in the year 2000 (Time B) as opposed to the year 1000 (Time A), when the burning of fossil fuels was not very common. The extensive use of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, during Time B has led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions are a result of human activities, including industrialization, transportation, and energy production. In contrast, during Time A, human activities were primarily based on agriculture and had minimal impact on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels in Time B releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is absorbed by processes like photosynthesis. This additional carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat and contributing to the observed increase in global temperatures, known as global warming or global climate change. As a result, Time B has a greater release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to more significant climate change impacts compared to Time A."},{"question":"Write a sentence based on this summary: swine flu looms over global economic recovery","response":"Swine flu, a sickness that spreads between pigs and people, is threatening the time when the world's money and businesses start to get better."},{"question":"William George \\"Billy\\" Zane, Jr. (born February 24, 1966) is an American actor and producer.

The statement has been released by the United Nations to mark UN Disaster Reduction Day. More people are made homeless by environmental disasters than by war,according to the research by the Red Cross. That reality is proved by the earthquake in Pakistan. The widely publicized disaster has brought aid from the global community,according to Janos Bogardi,director of the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security. \\"If we can move swiftly in and give them a new start where they are,then they may stay in the area.

It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase . - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era. - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin. - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F. - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth). - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians. What is the relationship between 'marxophone' and 'plucked string instrument'?","response":"The relationship between the Marxophone and plucked string instruments lies in the fact that they are both types of stringed musical instruments. However, the way they produce sound and the mechanisms involved in playing them differ significantly. The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing. It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major, and four sets of chord strings. The player typically strums the chords with the left hand, while the right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings. The hammers bounce off the strings to produce the Marxophone's unique sound, which is somewhat similar to a mandolin and various types of hammered dulcimers. On the other hand, plucked string instruments are a class of musical instruments where strings are plucked using fingers, fingernails, or a plectrum. Examples of plucked string instruments include guitars, mandolins, ukuleles, and harps. In these instruments, sound is produced when the strings vibrate after being plucked. In summary, the Marxophone and plucked string instruments are both stringed musical instruments, but they have different approaches to creating sound. The Marxophone uses a hammer mechanism to strike the strings, whereas plucked string instruments involve directly plucking the strings with fingers or a plectrum."},{"question":"Choose your answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

He just sat in the passenger seat as I drove, relaxed, mouth hanging slightly open, looking at me the way someone examines a menu but can't decide on the chicken or the veal. The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number. The dog pulled his head back in, then rested his chin on top of the overhead roll-bar, his fur blowing back along his head like the spines of a porcupine. \\"Hello?\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" \\"Dingo! Are you there yet?\\" \\"No, not yet. I'm just outside the city.\\" Vegas flashed and blinked under the starless sky. \\"You get in touch with Mr. Waciejowski?\\" \\"Sure did. He's at the Denny's near the Excalibur. He's trying to stay away from the blackjack tables.\\" \\"Yeah, good for him. He has the box?\\" I could hear Luna stuffing something disgustingly healthy in her mouth. \\"Mmm hmm.\\" \\"He hasn't opened it, has he?\\" She swallowed. \\"Nah. I told him it was filled with old photos.\\" Cerberus shifted in the seat and scratched behind his neck with such force that the whole Jeep shook; a rather unsettling motion at 80 miles an hour. \\"Hey Luna, I've got a question for you.\\" I looked over to see the dog's nostrils flared out in the wind while his lips blew back and revealed his frightening set of teeth. \\"This, uh, this animal spirit guide you had me try to find. Do they ever show up, you know, in person?\\" Dingo thinks Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Luna should open the box - Cerberus should open the box - not enough information - Mr. Waciejowski should not open the box A:","response":"Mr. Waciejowski should not open the box. The detailed explanation for the answer is: From the conversation between Dingo and Luna, it is understood that they want to retrieve a box from Mr. Waciejowski. Luna has told Mr. Waciejowski that the box is filled with old photos, which suggests that the contents of the box are somewhat secretive or important and should not be opened by anyone else. Since Luna, one of the parties involved in this plan, hasn't mentioned that she, Cerberus or anyone else needs to open the box, the safest option is to ensure that Mr. Waciejowski does not open the box. As Dingo and Luna seem to be working together on a task, it can be assumed that they have some sort of plan or instructions about what to do with the box once they have acquired it. It's important for them to follow that plan and not let anyone else, including Mr. Waciejowski, tamper with it. Additionally, Cerberus is mentioned as a \\"dog\\" and acts like one (sticking his head out of the window and scratching himself), suggesting that he may not possess the ability or desire to open the box himself. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the text, it's essential for Mr. Waciejowski not to open the box, as Dingo and Luna appear to have a better understanding of its importance and intended use."},{"question":"Stemmatics, stemmology or stemmatology is a rigorous approach to textual criticism. Karl Lachmann (1793–1851) greatly contributed to making this method famous, even though he did not invent it. The method takes its name from the word stemma. The Ancient Greek word στέμματα and its loanword in classical Latin stemmata may refer to \\"family trees\\". This specific meaning shows the relationships of the surviving witnesses (the first known example of such a stemma, albeit with the name, dates from 1827). The family tree is also referred to as a cladogram. The method works from the principle that \\"community of error implies community of origin.\\" That is, if two witnesses have a number of errors in common, it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source, called a hyparchetype. Relations between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process, placing all extant manuscripts in a family tree or stemma codicum descended from a single archetype. The process of constructing the stemma is called recension, or the Latin recensio. The final stage of the stemma is called what? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"Alright buddy, stemmatics, stemmology or stemmatology is a big fancy word for a method used to study old texts, kind of like being a book detective. The name comes from an ancient word 'stemma' which can mean \\"family tree\\". You know how you, mommy, grandpa, and your cousin all come from the same family? It's like that, but with different versions of a book. If two books have the same mistake, it's like they're siblings, because they come from the same 'parent' book. So imagine we have lots of different copies of the same book, but they all have different mistakes. This method helps us figure out which copies come from which; with lots of thinking and detective work, we can trace back all copies to the very first version of the book, called the 'archetype'. That's like finding your family's oldest grandparent! The process of doing this tracing is called 'recension'. But remember buddy, it's not called anything when we reach the final stage of this process, when we have found the 'archetype'.

A 2015 review reported that “adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying, which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression.” Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents' social functioning. Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in Internet cafés seems only to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens, who find it easier to interact socially online. The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities. However, the Internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Paragraph: Two different rivers were stocked with adult fish.

Context: Ok, this one is not missing a class but much better story IMO. When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter. Now, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any ‘after school help!’ This was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough.

Get a piece of modeling wax and use a precision knife, Dremel, and any other tool needed to make a model of your jewelry. Whatever shape you make now will be the shape of your finished piece. You are making an exact replica of your eventual jewelry. Using a piece of jewelry you like as a model will help you design better pieces when you first start. Using some more wax, craft several long, wires out of wax and attach them to the model so that they all lead away from the piece. This is easier to understand when you see the whole process -- this wax will be covered in plaster, then melted out to make a hollow version of your shape. You then fill in the hollow part with silver. f you don't make sprues, the melted wax can't actually get out and make a hollow area. For smaller pieces, like a ring, you may only need one sprue. Larger pieces, like belt buckles, may need up to ten. All the sprues should meet at the same place. They will need to be attached to a sprue base. The sprues all meet together, and you attach the mold to the sprue base where all the sprues meet. This allows the wax to melt through the bottom of the base and leave the mold.

Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of \\"spiritual\\" and rarely use the term \\"New Age\\" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term, believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon. As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought, and the Theosophical Society. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age movement. Although the exact origins of the movement remain contested, it is agreed that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age movement have been identified. Theologically, the movement typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity which imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling.... - Niscience is a religious movement of the United States. Its parent organization, the Ann Ree Colton Foundation of Niscience, was founded in 1953 by Ann Ree Colton. It is characterized as a combination of Christianity and New Age spirituality, and combines the teachings of Jesus Christ with an engagement with meditation. Overview.

Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.

It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. and the situation: Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants.

According to the Daily Mail Australia, Fifita allegedly jumped out of the Jeep he was driving, and proceeded to punch and kick a Subaru on Taren Point Road, Miranda. Acting Inspector Michael Stuart informed the Sydney Morning Herald that the 25-year-old footy star is also accused of throwing an object at the Subaru. Witnesses say that both vehicles had stopped on Taren Point Road when the altercation occurred. The 25-year-old purportedly made threats, causing damage to the Subaru by punching and kicking it. Acting Inspector Stuart confirmed the incident, but no details have been released on the cause of the road rage, nor whether there were any injuries sustained. Andrew Fifita is a well-known figure in the world of Australian rules football. The 25-year-old sportsman was alleged to have been in negotiation for a 3.2 million four-year deal to leave the Cronulla Sharks. However, the deal seems to have fallen through, as no official announcements have been made concerning his departure from the team. Road rage incidents like this one can be a cause for concern, as they not only damage the vehicles involved but can also potentially put the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians at risk. Authorities usually encourage individuals to maintain a calm demeanor when behind the wheel and avoid engaging in aggressive behavior on the road to reduce the likelihood of these situations occurring. It is essential for everyone involved in traffic to practice patience and understanding when encountering frustrating situations to ensure the overall safety of all road users. As for Andrew Fifita, it remains unclear whether the alleged road rage incident will have any impact on his professional career. The Cronulla Sharks have not yet released any official statement concerning their star player's involvement in the matter. Legal consequences may arise depending on the severity of the damage to the involved vehicles and any injuries sustained during the incident. It is crucial that individuals such as Fifita, who are in the public eye, remember the influence they have on their fans and the importance of maintaining a good image both on and off the field."},{"question":"DetailsaboutafamilyforPerNilssonandChristinaJönsdotter What's a sentence that uses these characters?","response":"Per Nilsson and Christina Jönsdotter are family members with unique names, just like you and me!

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles \\"parted amiably two years later.\\" In 1995, with his company allegedly nearly bankrupt, LeMond reached a licensing-agreement with Trek Bicycle Corporation, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the \\"LeMond Bicycles\\" brand. LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek \\"destroyed\\" his relationship with his father. The lucrative partnership, which generated revenue for Trek in excess of 100,000,000 USD, would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years, but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond's relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti-doping advocacy. The two parties first found themselves at odds in July 2001, after LeMond expressed public concern over the relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek's star athlete, Lance Armstrong. \\"When I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari, I was devastated,\\" LeMond was quoted as saying of Armstrong. \\"If Lance is clean, it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports. If he isn't, it would be the greatest fraud.\\" Trek's president John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize, claiming, \\"Greg's public comments hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand.\\" Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that, \\"As a contractual partner, he [LeMond] could criticize doping only generally - not point his finger at specific athletes, particularly one that happens to be the company's main cash cow.\\" In April 2008, Trek announced that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and would sue to sever the licensing agreement. It quickly emerged that in March 2008, LeMond had filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract, claiming that they had not made a \\"best efforts\\" attempt to sell his bicycles, as well as describing attempts to 'silence' him about doping, including incidents in 2001 and 2004. His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold 10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, a country in which LeMond was both famous and popular. As promised, Trek counter-sued and stopped producing bicycles under the LeMond brand. After nearly two years of litigation, in February 2010, LeMond reached an out-of-court settlement with Trek in their breach-of-contract dispute, the terms of which were confidential. The settlement permitted the case to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning, \\"neither side can produce the same claims against one another in a future lawsuit.\\" And although settlement terms were not disclosed, LeMond reportedly obtained full control over the LeMond Bicycles name, while Trek made a donation of 200,000 USD to the charity 1in6, of which LeMond was a founding member of the board of directors.

(2). leave plastic on the roadside. (3). burn plastics in their yard. (4). throw away plastic containers....A:","response":"(1). place plastics in special containers. A person wanting to conserve resources in a positive way should place plastics in special containers, as this ensures that the materials can be collected, separated, and processed for recycling. By doing so, the individual contributes to the conservation of resources by reducing the need for raw materials and reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. (2) Leaving plastic on the roadside is not a positive way to conserve resources, as it results in littering and environmental pollution. Discarded plastics on the roadside can end up in waterways, posing a threat to wildlife and ecosystems. (3) Burning plastics in their yard is incorrect because burning plastics releases toxic chemicals into the air, which poses health risks to humans and animals, and contributes to air pollution. It is also a waste of resources since it does not contribute to recycling efforts. (4) Throwing away plastic containers is not a positive way to conserve resources, as this act results in sending plastics to landfills or incinerators rather than recycling centers where they can be repurposed.

But Leonardo Ulloa and Jeffrey Schlupp scored twice late on to win the tie. Article:","response":"Title: Tottenham's Heartbreak: Leicester City Strikes Late to Claim Victory in Thrilling Fixture In a pulsating game that had fans on the edge of their seats till the last minute, Leicester City managed to snatch a dramatic victory from the jaws of defeat against Tottenham. The Foxes clawed their way back into the game, with late goals from Leonardo Ulloa and Jeffrey Schlupp securing a gritty win in a fiercely contested tie. The match saw a series of thrilling moments, with the players giving their all to book their place in the next round of the competition. The game began in fiery fashion, with Andros Townsend opening the scoring for Tottenham. His goal came from the penalty spot after teammate Roberto Soldado was brought down inside the opposition's box. Townsend made no mistake in converting the penalty, sending veteran goalkeeper and debutant Mark Schwarzer the wrong way. Schwarzer, making his first appearance for the Foxes, couldn't prevent his side from going down early in the game. The match had its controversial moments, none more so than when Leicester City's record signing, Andrej Kramaric, was booked for diving. However, replays suggested that he might have been fouled on his way into the box. Despite the setback, the Foxes refused to let their heads drop and they continued to press for an equalizer. Their determination was evident in their style of play, which was not only aggressive but technically sound as well. With time running out, Leicester City's persistence finally paid off. Leonardo Ulloa grabbed the equalizer in the dying moments of the game, sparking ecstatic scenes around the stadium. Ulloa's goal seemed to galvanize his teammates, who continued their relentless attacking even as the clock ticked down. It was then that Jeffrey Schlupp made himself the hero of the night. Deep into stoppage time, he clinched victory for Leicester City with a thunderous strike that sent the home crowd into a frenzy. The last-gasp winner capped off an incredible comeback for the resilient Foxes, who refused to bow down even in the face of adversity. This sensational victory will surely live long in the memory of the Leicester City faithful, as they watched their team claw their way back from the brink of an almost certain defeat. The players showcased courage, grit, and determination in abundance, keeping their never-say-die attitude alive till the dying embers of the match. Tottenham, on the other hand, will rue their missed opportunities which allowed their opponents back into the contest. Their inability to put the game to bed when presented with chances led to their eventual downfall, and they will need to learn from their mistakes if they are to avoid such heartbreaks in the future. In conclusion, Leicester City's stunning come-from-behind victory against Tottenham will go down in history as one of the most dramatic comebacks in recent times. The goals from Leonardo Ulloa and Jeffrey Schlupp will be etched into the memories of the fans as the players embodied the spirit of resilience and determination that ultimately saw them emerge victorious.

A:","response":"To answer the elaborate question regarding the passing of two renowned composers, Richard Strauss and Béla Bartók, we must first delve into the respective life stories and backgrounds of these two extraordinary musicians in order to understand their historical context, contributions to the world of music, and the events leading up to their deaths. Richard Strauss was a German composer, conductor, and pianist born on June 11, 1864, in Munich, Germany. He was an influential figure in the late Romantic and early Modern periods, known primarily for his remarkable skill in orchestration and his versatility in composing music across various genres, including opera, tone poems, chamber music, and lieder. Some of his most famous works include the operas \\"Salome\\" and \\"Der Rosenkavalier,\\" and the tone poems \\"Don Juan\\" and \\"Also sprach Zarathustra,\\" the latter of which was famously used in the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's film, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Béla Bartók, born on March 25, 1881, in Nagyszentmiklós, Hungary (now Sânnicolau Mare, Romania), was a Hungarian composer and pianist who was a prominent figure in the early 20th century, immersed in the realms of both musical composition and ethnomusicology. Known for his fusion of Eastern European folk music and traditional classical music, Bartók's contributions continue to be regarded as some of the most unique and influential in the contemporary classical repertoire. His work reflects a deep understanding of the innovations of that era, such as the twelve-tone technique and the rise of atonality. Some of Bartók's most celebrated compositions include the six string quartets, the piano concertos, and the orchestral suite \\"The Miraculous Mandarin.\\" Now, equipped with the relevant contextual information, we can explore the events leading up to the passing of these two prominent composers. Richard Strauss's later years were marked by a number of challenges, both personal and professional. World War II and the rise of the Nazi regime cast a shadow over Strauss' life. His granddaughter's Jewish heritage further complicated matters, causing him distress in his final years. Despite these difficulties, Strauss continued to compose until his final days. He passed away on September 8, 1949, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, at the age of 85. His final works bore a more introspective quality, such as the \\"Four Last Songs,\\" which poignantly reflect themes of death and transition. Béla Bartók's later years were also fraught with hardship and struggle. His staunch opposition to the Nazi regime compelled him to emigrate to the United States in 1940. Once in America, however, he found it difficult to establish himself professionally and faced financial troubles. Additionally, his health began to deteriorate—a diagnosis of leukemia would eventually be revealed. Despite these complications, Bartók remained productive; the final years of his life saw the completion of several important works, such as the \\"Concerto for Orchestra\\" and the \\"Third Piano Concerto.\\" His condition finally caught up with him, and Béla Bartók passed away on September 26, 1945, in New York City, at the age of 64. In summary, it becomes clear that Béla Bartók passed away first, on September 26, 1945, followed by Richard Strauss about four years later, on September 8, 1949. While both composers experienced hardships in their twilight years, their legacies continue to influence the world of classical music and provide inspiration to generations of musicians and listeners alike."},{"question":"Article: Somehow, the conservative jurist's arguments in prior opinions have become a regular feature in lower court rulings legalizing gay marriage. The latest example came Thursday in a decision by renowned Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, with whom Scalia has an ongoing feud. Posner wrote an impassioned opinion for a unanimous three-judge panel to overturn gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. He said three past Supreme Court decisions in favor of gay rights — Romer v. Evans, Lawrence v. Texas and United States v. Windsor — didn't necessarily make gay marriage a constitutional right, although he noted that Scalia had suggested otherwise. \\"But Justice Scalia, in a dissenting opinion in Lawrence ... joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas, thought not. He wrote that 'principle and logic' would require the Court, given its decision in Lawrence, to hold that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage,\\" Posner wrote for the Court. He was referring to Scalia's passionate dissent in a 2003 case which prohibited states from outlawing consensual same-sex sodomy. Scalia declared at the time that the Court had endorsed the \\"homosexual agenda\\" and had effectively knocked down the legal argument for prohibiting gay marriage. \\"Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned,\\" Scalia wrote. He made a similar prediction in the 2013 ruling that axed the Defense of Marriage Act. It was a cheeky move by Posner. As Garrett Epps, a constitutional law professor at the University of Baltimore, argued recently in The Atlantic, Scalia may have ironically made it likelier that lower courts rule for gay marriage by insisting that the Supreme Court had quashed the legal justification against it. Scalia and Posner, both appointed by Ronald Reagan, have been feuding for several years. In 2012, Posner wrote a lengthy piece in The New Republic attacking Scalia's newly published book, arguing that the justice's philosophy of \\"originalism\\" was a smokescreen for the goal of achieving conservative ideological outcomes. Scalia accused the judge of lying and the two have been critical of one another ever since. ||||| A box of cupcakes are seen topped with icons of same-sex couples at City Hall in San Francisco, June 29, 2013. WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court judge known for his outspoken views described arguments by Wisconsin and Indiana defending bans on gay marriage as \\"totally implausible\\" on Thursday, in a ruling in favor of same-sex couples. Judge Richard Posner, appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981, wrote the unanimous decision on behalf of a three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled against the bans. The unusually swift decision, issued just over a week after the court heard oral arguments in two different cases, does not take immediate effect and is unlikely do so until the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in during its coming term. The arguments advanced by both states in defense of the bans were \\"totally implausible,\\" wrote Posner, 75 and the panel's lone Republican appointee. \\"Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure,\\" Posner said. Posner has written dozens of books, including one about economics and intellectual property law. He also is a founding author of a blog on law and economics. Two years ago he engaged in an unusual public spat with Justice Antonin Scalia, a leading conservative on the Supreme Court. In a review of Scalia's new book, Posner wrote the justice's judicial opinions deviated from the strict, text-based approach to interpreting law espoused in his book. Scalia, also appointed by Reagan, publicly disagreed. EQUAL PROTECTION The ruling said the bans on gay marriage in the two states violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. Two other federal appeals courts have ruled the same way, striking down bans in Virginia, Utah and Oklahoma. The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the gay marriage issue during its coming term, which starts in October and ends in June 2015. More than 30 courts overall have ruled in favor of gay marriage since a Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 struck down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act under which states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. A federal judge in Louisiana bucked the trend on Wednesday when he upheld that state's ban. Gay marriage is legal in 19 of the 50 states and in Washington, D.C. Wisconsin will appeal the ruling, said a spokeswoman for the state's attorney general, J.B. Van Hollen, a Republican. “The attorney general has always believed that this case will ultimately be decided by the United States Supreme Court,\\" spokeswoman Dana Brueck said. Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement that he will seek a suspension of the appeals court ruling and hopes for a quick decision from the Supreme Court. Hoosiers Unite for Marriage, a gay rights group that backed the challenge to Indiana's ban, said in a statement that its members were \\"incredibly grateful\\" that the court ruled so quickly in favor of couples who want to get married. Larry Dupuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, who has helped litigate the case, said he hoped state officials would \\"see the light on this\\" and end their defense of the ban. (Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Frances Kerry, Grant McCool and Howard Goller) |||||Summary:","response":"The article discusses how conservative jurist Justice Scalia's previous arguments have become a recurring part of lower court rulings that legalize gay marriage. Specifically, it speaks about a case ruled by Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, who used Scalia’s arguments to overturn gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. Scalia and Posner, despite both being appointed by Ronald Reagan, have an ongoing feud due to their clashing viewpoints on legal principles and rulings. Interestingly, Posner, in his argument, cited Scalia's dissenting opinion in a past Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas. In this 2003 case, the court ruled against the outlawing of consensual same-sex sodomy. Scalia in his dissent, held that the court’s ruling in this matter would inevitably lead towards the constitutional recognition of same-sex marriages. He contended that it was a contradiction for the same court to hold constitutional prohibitions against same-sex marriage when it had endorsed the right to same-sex sodomy. This dissent of Scalia was applied by Posner as he argued for the rights of same-sex marriages, bouncing off from Scalia’s past arguments, and using them, ironically, to uphold the opposite of what Scalia intended. Therefore, while Scalia had tried to argue for the traditional conservative prohibition against gay marriage, his arguments were used instead to uphold the constitutionality of same-sex marriages. This led to the humorously ironic situation of Scalia inadvertently contributing to the legal arguments favoring gay marriage. This dynamic signifies the ongoing evolution of legal thought on the matter, with past dissenting opinions being utilized in favor of the issue they were designed to contest. It highlights the transforming landscape of constitutional law, which now includes the inherent right to same-sex marriage. The pushback against traditional conservative views embodied by Scalia’s past dissent is also shown in the courts’ unanimous decisions that reject bans on gay marriage, and instead, uphold the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, utilizing the argument of equal protection under the constitution. The article finally includes the perspective of states that had their bans on gay marriage overturned. Wisconsin, for one, announced its intention to appeal the ruling, insisting that the decision regarding gay marriage will eventually fall under the jurisdiction of the US Supreme Court. Indiana also plans to challenge the court ruling, hoping for an expedited Supreme Court decision. Member groups of those opposing the ban find the quick court ruling in favor of same-sex marriages as a positive step forward. The article sets the stage for the expected Supreme Court hearing on the matter of same-sex marriage. Amidst the shifting viewpoints and the utilization of legal principles in nuanced ways, the final decision of the Supreme Court will be the ultimate declaration on the matter of constitutionality of same-sex marriages."},{"question":"Answer the following question: If a coup-de-etat happens with hopes of changing society, what is called for?

What is the answer?","response":"The Diamantina Trench is located in the Indian Ocean. It is an elongated, narrow trench that stretches approximately 1,100 kilometers (684 miles) in length and is situated about 1,600 kilometers (995 miles) to the west of Perth, Australia. The trench is named after the HMAS Diamantina, an Australian warship that investigated and charted the trench during a survey mission in the 1950s. The Indian Ocean is the third-largest ocean in the world, covering approximately 20% of the Earth's water surface. It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west, Australia to the east, and Antarctica to the south. With its vast expanse, the Indian Ocean is home to a variety of important features, including numerous underwater trenches, ridges, and seamounts. The Diamantina Trench is one of those features and is associated with the complex tectonic activity between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Antarctic Plate. Trenches like the Diamantina Trench form at the boundaries of tectonic plates, where one plate is forced to slide beneath another in a process called subduction. This ultimately leads to the formation of deep-sea trenches along with the creation of volcanic arcs and mountain ranges on the overriding plate. Notably, the Diamantina Trench is positioned close to the southeastern corner of the Wharton Basin, a large submarine basin within the Indian Ocean. The maximum depth in the Diamantina Trench is approximately 7,078 meters (23,220 feet). Such an extreme depth makes it one of the deepest trenches in the Indian Ocean, although it is still not quite as deep as the Java Trench, which is considered the ocean's deepest point. Due to its remote location and deep-sea environment, the Diamantina Trench remains largely unexplored. However, advancements in deep-sea technology are gradually allowing scientists to uncover the mysteries hidden within these underwater trenches. Understanding the geological and biological processes that occur in these deep-sea environments is essential for gaining insights into the formation and evolution of Earth's crust and the diverse, unknown species that inhabit the seafloor."},{"question":"Premise: \\"But there's no doubt he can throw light on one or two obscure points in young Beresford's letter.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Beresford is dead and so he can't explain this himself.\\" true? pick from the following.

Plot title: Crack in the World Movie plot: An international consortium of scientists, operating as Project Inner Space in Tanganyika, Africa, is trying to tap into the Earth's geothermal energy by drilling a very deep hole down to the Earth's core. The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff. She and Rampion barely escape in time to observe the fiery birth of a second moon. Its release stops the crack from further splitting the Earth. My question: What is Dr. Sorensen dying of?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose We are in a low altitude zone happens, how will it affect less oxygen will be produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of being in a low altitude zone can have a direct effect on the oxygen availability and, as a result, on the process of respiration. At low altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is higher compared to high altitudes, which means there is a greater concentration of oxygen molecules available to breathe. In this condition, there will not be less oxygen produced but instead more oxygen will be available for the body to use. This increased concentration of oxygen allows the body to efficiently perform respiration and oxygenate the blood. When there is more oxygen available, the oxygen saturation levels in the blood increase, which allows the cells to have sufficient oxygen for their metabolic activities, and the carbon dioxide produced by the cells can be easily eliminated by the respiratory system. In conclusion, being in a low altitude zone enhances the oxygen availability, which can positively influence the respiration process by providing more oxygen for the body to use. This will not have a negative effect on the process, but it will support the efficiency and overall functioning of the respiratory system."},{"question":"Sentence 1: RFPs also tend to be controlled by non-ideal phenomena and turbulent effects .

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited.

Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \\"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

The first sentence, \\"In the evening, finally a bowl came with a small soup with a thin piece of bread,\\" is slightly more elaborate and describes the event with more emphasis on it being a long-awaited moment, as indicated by the use of the word \\"finally.\\" Additionally, the words \\"small\\" and \\"thin\\" describe the meager nature of the soup and bread. The second sentence, \\"In the evening, a bowl of thin soup came with a piece of bread,\\" also communicates the same situation but in a more concise manner. The description is more straightforward, and the adjectives \\"thin\\" and \\"small\\" are combined in this paraphrase. It gives a more succinct picture of the same scene, and it lacks the additional emphasis about the long wait for this meal to be served.

The No. 20 Lady Vols began the post-Summitt era Friday with a stunning 80-71 loss at Chattanooga. Now they don't have much time to recover from their first season-opening loss since 1999, as they continue their road trip Sunday at No. 22 Georgia Tech. A loss to the Yellow Jackets likely would drop the Lady Vols out of the Top 25 for the first time since February 1985. \\"That's just the nature of this game and the nature of our schedule,\\" said Tennessee coach Holly Warlick, who stumbled out of the gate in her head coaching debut after spending the last 27 seasons as an assistant on Summitt's staff. \\"It's extremely hard. With five new players, it is what it is. There's nothing we can do about it. We've got to roll up our sleeves and get back to work.\\" Summitt, who announced last year she had early-onset dementia, stepped down in April after collecting 1,098 wins, eight national titles and 18 Final Four appearances in 38 seasons. Summitt remains on staff as head coach emeritus, attends most of the Lady Vols' practice and watched Friday's game from the stands. The transition figured to cause some growing pains. Tennessee's No. 20 preseason ranking was its lowest position in the Top 25 since 1985. The Lady Vols don't return a single player who started an NCAA tournament game last season during their run to a regional final. Their roster includes five newcomers - four freshmen and a junior-college transfer. But nobody expected this kind of start. Tennessee committed 26 turnovers and had only six assists against Chattanooga. The Lady Vols had 17 turnovers in the first half alone. They never led in the second half and never cut Chattanooga's advantage below six points over the last 13 minutes. \\"We have to learn from this,\\" said Tennessee junior guard Meighan Simmons, one of only three upperclassmen on the roster. The biggest lessons came when Tennessee was on defense. Tennessee spent the preseason adjusting to an uptempo style designed to utilize Tennessee's speed and compensate for its relative lack of size. The Lady Vols believed their energy would harass opposing offenses and force turnovers. \\"We're not going to outscore anybody,\\" Warlick said. \\"We're not going to outshoot them. We've got to get them to turn the ball over to get easy looks.\\" While Tennessee struggled to take care of the ball all night, Chattanooga collected 17 assists and committed only 13 turnovers. The Lady Mocs scored 52 points and shot 56.3 percent from the floor in the second half. \\"Our defense was non-existent,\\" Warlick said. That defense will have to play much better for the Lady Vols to avoid their first 0-2 start since 1970. Georgia Tech went 26-8 and reached a regional semifinal last year and should get an emotional lift Sunday from playing the first women's game at the new McCamish Pavilion. The Yellow Jackets had to play their home games off campus last season. \\"As long as we learn from this, it's OK,\\" Warlick said. \\"If we keep making the same mistakes, we're not going to get any better.\\" There's one history lesson that could encourage Tennessee. When the Lady Vols last dropped a season opener back in 1999, they lost only three more times the rest of the season and went on to reach the NCAA final.","response":"The Lady Vols, a girls basketball team, lost a game against another team called Chattanooga. This is their first season without their famous coach, Pat Summitt. They are now ranked number 20 and if they lose their next game against the Yellow Jackets, they might fall out of the Top 25. Their new coach, Holly Warlick, thinks they need to work hard and improve. They made many mistakes in their last game, and they need to play better defense. If they learn from their mistakes, they can get better and hopefully win more games in the future."},{"question":"registration 9 july 2004 01:04 Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly?","response":"\\"Registration 9 July 2004 01:04.\\""},{"question":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Dred Scott v. Sandford. Yes or no? Answer: Chief Justice Roger Taney , writing for the court, held that Scott, as a person of African ancestry, was not a citizen of the United States and therefore had no right to sue in federal court. Question: What did the Supreme Court determine in Dred Scott v. Sandford? A:","response":"Yes, the statement provided is a correct summary of the Dred Scott v. Sandford case, which was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1857. In this case, the Supreme Court determined several key issues, the most significant of which was the status of African Americans, specifically slaves and their descendants, as citizens with rights and their ability to sue in federal court. Dred Scott, an enslaved African American, sued for his freedom and that of his wife and their two daughters. Scott's argument for freedom was based on the fact that he and his family had previously lived in free territories, which he believed made them free individuals according to the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The Missouri Compromise prohibited slavery north of the 36° 30' parallel, excluding present-day Missouri. Chief Justice Roger Taney, writing for the majority, argued in his opinion that, as a person of African descent, Dred Scott was not and could not be considered a citizen of the United States. As a consequence, Scott had no standing to sue in a federal court. The ruling essentially denied the rights and protections granted to U.S. citizens under the Constitution to an entire group of people based on their race, which had a tremendous and lasting impact on the nation. Additionally, the Supreme Court ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. Justice Taney's opinion argued that Congress did not have the authority to regulate and restrict slavery in the territories and that such restrictions violated the property rights of slaveowners. This decision invalidated the legislative efforts to limit the spread of slavery in the United States, further aggravating an already tense debate over the issue. In summary, the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford determined that African Americans, including slaves and their descendants, were not considered citizens of the United States and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court. This ruling had wide-ranging consequences, ultimately contributing to the increased tensions between the North and the South that would eventually lead to the American Civil War."},{"question":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"A man in black plays the harmonica.\\" can we conclude that \\"A man in black strums his guitar.\\"?

When the heist goes horribly wrong, the gang is forced to run. Stretch suggests travelling across the desert, which the rest of the gang reluctantly agrees to.After much wandering, the gang finally arrives at a small ghost town named \\"Yellow Sky\\" where they decide to stay temporarily. Unfotunately, they are unexpectedly greeted by \\"Mike\\" (Anne Baxter), a tough young woman who does not take their presence lightly. Eventually, she relents and allows them to remain, and they find out she is the daughter of a prosepector.One of the gang members, Dude (Richard Widmark), soon begins to suspect the possibility that the prospector is hiding gold, and begins leading his men to the belief that they should find it and take it for themselves. Stretch objects, but is unable to pursuade his gang otherwise.Eventually, things get out of control, and a huge showdown occurs in which all but two of Stretch's gang are killed. The surviving members of the gang finally reconcile and decide to reform themselves.Stretch returns to the bank a few days later, seemingly committing another hold-up, only to return the money that he had taken.

This rule was called \\"Proposition 8\\" or \\"Prop. 8\\" for short. Prop. 8 was a big deal because it was about who some people could marry. Some grown-ups agreed with this rule and others didn't. The people who live in this land get to have their voices heard by voting. Voting is like choosing your favorite ice cream flavor at the store; everyone has their own taste. So, one sunny day, the people went and chose whether they liked Prop. 8 or not. After everyone made their choice, it was decided that Prop. 8 would be a rule for everyone to follow. But, some people didn't like this decision and wanted to change it. They thought it wasn't fair that the rule was made just because the majority of people wanted it. In this land, there are very important grown-ups called \\"state officials\\" who help make decisions about rules. They are like the teachers in a school who make sure everyone follows the playground rules. Some of these state officials didn't agree with Prop. 8 and tried to say \\"No!\\" even after people had voted. But, just like your parents can't change the rules of a board game after you start playing, these state officials couldn't just say \\"no\\" to Prop. 8 after the people had voted. The leaders who wear special robes, called \\"judges,\\" made a very important decision. They said that state officials can't \\"veto\\" or say \\"no\\" to something that the people have voted for and approved. This decision by the judges was a big deal because it helps make sure the people's voices are heard and their choices matter. It's like when you and your friends vote on what game to play at recess, and your choice counts just as much as everyone else's. In the end, this story teaches us that even when grown-ups don't like a decision that was made, they can't always change it. It's important for the people to have a say and for everyone's voice to be heard, like in voting for Prop. 8. And that, my little friends, is the story of how the judges said that state officials can't veto what the people have chosen through voting. Now, it's time to go play and remember that every person's voice and choice is important!"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Two farms were growing food for several nearby cities. Vole farm grew organic produce and produced organic milk, while Anthill farm did not possess the USDA organic certification. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm produces less milk with no antibiotics? Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen, \\"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\\" (\\"What man is the gatekeeper?\\"). This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \\"Arthur's Court\\" sometimes substituted for \\"The Island of Britain\\" in the formula \\"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\\". While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon, \\"Chief of the Lords of this Island\\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae.

Spaceport Sweden, a company founded in 2007, hopes to be able to provide the first flights within a decade from Kiruna's airport. \\"We're working on establishing commercial flights from Sweden to space for tourism and research, and to create a launching pad at the airport,\\" explained the company's enthusiastic director, Karin Nilsdotter, seated in her office at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF). The idea is that space tourists would take off for a maximum two-hour trip into space aboard futuristic spacecraft currently undergoing testing, which resemble a cross between an airplane and a space shuttle and which can carry between one and six passengers. The sub-orbital flights will send passengers 100 kilometres (60 miles) above Earth and allow them to experience five minutes of weightlessness. Kiruna's location in the far north of Sweden, and Europe, makes it a prime location for space flights, Nilsdotter said. The space flights would not be disturbed by heavy air traffic, nor is the region a densely populated area. The wide-open spaces within Sweden's borders also mean no bureaucratic red-tape to be resolved with other countries. Kiruna also has 60 years experience of space research to its credit. IRF was founded in 1957 and the Swedish space research and rocket centre Esrange, located in the town, was founded in 1966. \\"We have to use this knowledge to create a unique adventure with global impact: space travel,\\" Nilsdotter insisted. \\"Even if it's too early to give any figures, market studies show there is potential for 14,000 travellers after 10 years of business,\\" she added. Spaceport Sweden is not building its own spacecraft, but will instead collaborate with a company that is doing so, she says, refusing to disclose how many spacecraft it will operate nor the identity of its partner. In the United States, several companies are already developing aircraft capable of carrying space tourists, such as Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. \\"The technology isn't fully developed yet,\\" Nilsdotter said, adding that the companies were currently carrying out test flights in the United States. The first commercial space flights are expected to take place in the United States in 2014 and a few years after that in Sweden. The head of the Esrange space research and rocket site, Lennart Poromaa, is meanwhile more measured in his enthusiasm for the project. \\"In a few years there may be commercial space flights, but it will take longer than people think,\\" he said. Esrange pulled out of the project \\"because we're not about creating adventure\\", he explained. But \\"we could help them if they need help in the field of research, possibly\\", the aerospace engineer said. According to Nilsdotter, space flights could take off four times a day. Esrange meanwhile launches four rockets a year. \\"Researchers who want to test their experiments in microgravity may be able to fly with us and then adjust their projects,\\" she said. In the United States, more than 1,000 tickets for space flights have already been reserved, at around 200,000 (153,000 euros) apiece. For adventure-seekers who can't wait to visit space, Spaceport Sweden already offers flights from Kiruna airport to view the northern lights, a spectacular phenomenon of colourful lights that streak across the night sky, for the tidy sum of 6,990 kronor (810 euros, 1,059).

You can help by adding to it. (October 2014) Jacob is a young man who defends his town from evil forces, aided by a magic sword. He saves a girl called Sarah from a horde of the reanimated dead, and they escape through the floor of a church. An evil necromancer named Mathias confronts Sarah and demands an amulet given to her by her uncle before he died. Sarah refuses, and after threatening to unleash all the evils he can conjure, Mathias disappears. In the morning, Sarah and Jacob return to Sarah's house through streets, fields, churches and underground tunnels, pursued by hordes of demonic creatures. They arrive around midday to find Mathias is already there, holding a sword to Sarah's little sister Jill's throat. Mathias threatens to kill Jill unless Sarah gives him the amulet. Sarah makes Mathias promise he will let Jill go, and gives him the amulet. Mathias disappears with both Jill and the necklace, and Sarah begs Jacob to go save Jill from Mathias. Jacob reluctantly agrees. Jacob arrives at Sarah's dead uncle's house and fights Mathias. He manages to destroy the amulet, defeating Mathias, but Jill falls through a hole in the floor. Jacob dives after her and breaks her fall with his own body, unharmed himself because he cannot die due to a protection spell that Sarah's uncle cast before he died. They return to Jill's home. Her mother and her sister Sarah are dead, killed by the reanimated dead while Jacob was not there to protect them. Jacob returns to Sarah's uncle's house to find Mathias reading through his necromancer spells, looking for a way to restore his power. Mathias laughs and boasts that he cannot be killed because he is already dead. Jacob says grimly that he is not there to kill Mathias; instead he will torture Mathias for all eternity. The movie fades out with Jacob repeatedly slashing Mathias with his sword and the sounds of Mathias's screams filling the air.[2] Answer:","response":"Jacob is armed with a magic sword in the movie \\"Fading of the Cries.\\""},{"question":"Belki de Exit Festivalinin başarısını sürdürerek, ülke iyi bir müzik mekanı olarak ün kazanabilir.

Heat is released, causing a net increase in the temperature of the solution. Conversely, other substances have positive heats of solution. For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder. Calculations involving heats of solutions follow the same basic approach that we have used with other enthalpy problems. A scientist is in the lab testing mixing water with different chemicals. While working with chemical A he notes that the water becomes colder after combining them. With chemical B the water becomes much warmer. Given the changes in temperature, does chemical A cause an exothermic process or an endothermic process? Answer:","response":"Chemical A causes an endothermic process. This is because the dissolution of the solute in water absorbs energy, causing the surrounding water (solution) to become colder. In contrast, chemical B causes an exothermic process, as the dissolution releases heat and results in a net increase in the temperature of the solution."},{"question":"Solve this math problem Solve -1386*p = -1415*p + 116 for p.","response":"To solve the equation -1386*p = -1415*p + 116 for p, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 1415*p to both sides of the equation to isolate the 'p' term on one side. -1386*p + 1415*p = -1415*p + 116 + 1415*p Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. 29*p = 116 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 29 to solve for 'p'. p = 116 / 29 Step 4: Simplify the result. p = 4 So, the solution to the equation is p = 4."},{"question":"Berths can be rented for a season or on an advantageous longterm basis where you get 5 seasons for the price of 4 What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","response":"Berths can be rented for a season, or on an advantageous long-term basis, where you get 5 seasons for the price of 4.

It's not like anyone else is interested. She's the only reporter there. Anyway, her editor discourages her from working on this lame story. But hey, she does anyway. She goes to see the killer's sister & mom. A few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time-- somebody blows up their trailer-- huge ball of fire. Then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital. She finds him hungover on his boat, but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them (and have blown up the boat big time-- huge ball of fire). The reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them. In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street, there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse, some car chases with wreckage & death, a fake suicide, etc. etc. Lotsa stiffs, all kindsa carnage. Great stuff, but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is: why in hell the original guy got whacked. What's the motivation? Of course, it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested. Through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story. Nobody else in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies. True, the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity. His job was a little bit dull. He was just the President. Yeah, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent. Is that the spoiler? It should be. After all there are no TV cameras, no other print reporters, no bloggers... just another one of those police blotter crimes... So what's the spoiler? Lemme think... No! Wait!

In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature.

Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.[not in citation given] What feature of bitumen use in photography made it impractical?","response":"The feature of bitumen use in photography that made it impractical was the many hours of exposure in the camera that were required for the process."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Hans is in love with Christina (Susan Denberg), the disfigured daughter of a local innkeeper. Christina's father disapproves of their relationship because Hans's father was executed for murder -- an execution Hans witnessed as a young boy. One night, while visiting Christina at the inn, Hans fights with three upper class snobs -- Anton (Peter Blythe), Johann (Derek Folds) and Karl (Barry Warren) -- when they insult her. Later that night, the three snobs sneak back into the inn and assault Christina's father, killing him.Hans is arrested for the murder. Despite the sterling character references of Dr Hertz and Frankenstein, the testimony of Anton, Johann and Karl persuade the jury. Because Hans will not reveal his whereabouts during the time of the murder -- he was making love with Christina -- he is sentenced to die at the same guillotine that killed his father some twenty years earlier.Frankenstein sees this as an opportunity to test his new machinery on a human, and he has Dr Hertz arrange to receive Hans's dead body. Christina, unaware that Hans had been sentenced to death, stumbles upon the execution site and sees Hans die. Distraught, she throws herself off a bridge and drowns. Frankenstein and Hertz successfully trap Hans' soul. The authorities bring Christina to Dr Hertz's office. Frankenstein persuades Hertz to trap her soul; once they have healed her injuries and facial disfigurements, they will restore her soul to her body.The procedure is a success.

Make this proper case","response":"The division of the city of Berlin was solidified when the Berlin Wall was constructed on August 13, 1961. This event marked a massive turning point for both the city of Berlin and the international political scene, as it reinforced the division between the communist Eastern Bloc, led by the Soviet Union, and the capitalist Western Bloc, led by the United States and its European allies. The division can be traced back to the end of World War II when the victorious Allied powers – the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union – each took control of a portion of Germany. They also divided the city of Berlin into four sectors, despite the fact that the city was located well within the Soviet-controlled zone. The Soviet Union governed East Berlin and East Germany, while the Western Allies controlled West Berlin and West Germany. Over time, tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies became more and more strained, as both sides began establishing separate governing institutions within their respective zones. As the Cold War began to escalate, the differences between the communist and capitalist systems became even more pronounced. The erection of the Berlin Wall can be seen as a physical representation of the ideological divide that characterized the post-war era. The 28-mile-long wall, made primarily of concrete and barbed wire, encircled West Berlin, separating it from East Berlin and the rest of East Germany. It was designed not only to keep Eastern Germans from fleeing to the West, but also to prevent the influx of Western ideas and culture into the communist state. Throughout its existence, the Berlin Wall stood as a tangible symbol of the division between East and West Germany, and more broadly, the Iron Curtain that separated the Eastern Bloc from the Western Bloc during the Cold War. Over a period of 28 years, families, friends, and loved ones were separated by the Wall, and numerous individuals lost their lives attempting to cross to the West. The fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, signified the end of the Cold War's most glaring and divisive symbol, ushering in a new era of reunification and cooperation within Germany and between the formerly warring power blocs. Today, the remnants of the Wall serve as a poignant reminder of the city's turbulent history, the division it endured, and the power of reconciliation."},{"question":"I had a field hockey tournament today and it was amazing .

The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us. Their first gig was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at Saint Martins College. The band played at the school on 6 November 1975, in support of a pub rock group called Bazooka Joe, arranging to use their amps and drums. The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs, including the Who's \\"Substitute\\", the Small Faces' \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\", and \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\", made famous by the Monkees; according to observers, they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who was steaming open letters? Movie plot title: The Lives of Others Movie plot: The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. The film opens in East Berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the Stasi, or secret police. Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), code name HGW XX/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. Wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. A student asks a question that Wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \\"bourgeois\\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. During the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck draws a portrait of Wiesler that borders on caricature: Wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the Stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. He is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \\"the System,\\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better Socialist society.At the end of the class, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the Culture Department at Stasi, comes to invite Wiesler to a theatrical premiere. The play is by the celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and its leading character is played by Dreyman's lover, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress of great reputation. Dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush East Berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among DDR officials who value him because he's one of the few East German writers whose work is read in the west. He preserves the respect of the artistic community by using his (relatively) secure position for occasional interventions in favor of dissident fellow artists....

This research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the problem. The findings are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Dr Trent Garner, from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News: \\"The virus seems to be spreading at a rate that exceeds the ability of a frog to hop, and there seems to be human-aided dispersal of the virus.\\" Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found across the world and they affect different species in different ways. In the UK, one type of ranavirus was found to be present in the South East of England in the 1980s, and it has since spread. It can kill common frogs either by causing sores and blisters to form on the animal's skin or by causing their internal organs to bleed. \\"In a certain proportion of populations, the disease persists. And when it persists, frogs decline by around 85%, and they don't seem to be recovering,\\" said Dr Garner. To analyse the movement of the disease in the UK, scientists looked at two decades of data recorded by a citizen science scheme called the Frog Mortality Project, which is now coordinated through Garden Wildlife Health. Genetic records suggested that ranavirus was not always present in the UK, and had probably been introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. The study also found that while infection is spread by the natural movement of amphibians, garden ponds could also be playing a key role. Dr Garner said: \\"Potentially garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to move around and reach new sites.\\" He said that taking frogspawn or frogs from one pond and placing them in another could be helping to spread ranavirus. \\"There are also other species that could potentially carry ranavirus - ornamental fish for example. So I do think there is a case to be made to investigate their role in infections.\\" Lead author Dr Stephen Price, from University College London, ZSL and Queen Mary University of London, said: \\"Ranavirus is one of the most serious health threats currently facing the UK's amphibian population. \\"So our findings that humans seem to have helped move the virus around, facilitating its rapid spread, could be translated into some straightforward ways to manage the risk of disease outbreaks.\\" He added: \\"We certainly don't want to discourage people from adding ponds to their urban gardens - this remains one of the most positive steps we can all take to support wildlife. \\"But equally we would strongly urge people to try to limit how much potentially-infectious material they're moving into and out of their gardens in the process.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter: @BBCMorelle What is a summary of this text?","response":"Ranaviruses are a group of viruses that can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, causing significant harm to species such as the common frog in the UK.

All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources... answer the following question: What are the full scientific names of the mangrove tree species that all have the same characteristics?

Family and friends of the Newcastle United supporter were joined by club manager Alan Pardew and team captain Fabricio Coloccini. Mr Sweeney and fellow Newcastle fan John Alder, 63, were killed when the flight crashed in Ukraine on 17 July. A Newcastle scarf and shirt was placed on his coffin as a sign of his commitment to the team. The hour-long service was told Mr Sweeney loved reading, especially Lord Of The Rings and Animal Farm. The pews of St Mary's Cathedral were packed for the funeral service - a celebration of Liam Sweeney's life as it said on the front of the order of service. Some wore badges with a photo of Liam alongside Newcastle United's badge and others T-shirts bearing the message - RIP Sweeney and Alder. It was Liam's passion for the football club and Geordie pride which ran through the service. His coffin was brought in to the sounds of Local Hero. A poem read by friends Malcolm Pegg and Amanda-Jade Fowler told of how fervently he had followed his team. We also heard of Liam's love of reading, music and The Simpsons. Canon Robert Spence described him as \\"a gentle young boy who became a giant gentleman\\" and said he \\"deserves a place in Geordie mythology\\".

Translate to English","response":"In order to translate the given text from German to English, I will go through the following steps: 1. Identify the subject and verb in each clause of the text. 2. Determine the tense and mood of the verbs. 3. Identify any direct objects, indirect objects, or prepositional phrases. 4. Translate each word and phrase as accurately as possible while maintaining the original meaning. 5. Reconstruct the sentence in English while preserving its original structure and meaning as much as possible. Now let's perform the steps for the given text: 1. In the first clause \\"Da werden Bilanzen gefälscht\\", the verb is \\"werden gefälscht\\" (are falsified) and the subject is \\"Bilanzen\\" (balance sheets). In the second clause \\"Gelder veruntreut\\", the verb is \\"veruntreut\\" (embezzled) and the subject is \\"Gelder\\" (funds). In the third clause \\"Fehlinformationen geschickt in die Öffentlichkeit lanciert\\", the verb is \\"lanciert\\" (launched) and the subject is \\"Fehlinformationen\\" (misinformation). The adverb \\"geschickt\\" (cleverly) modifies the verb \\"lanciert\\". 2. The tense and mood of all verbs are in the simple present tense, passive voice. 3. In the third clause, there is the prepositional phrase \\"in die Öffentlichkeit\\" (into the public). 4. Translating each word and phrase as accurately as possible: Da = There werden = are Bilanzen = balance sheets gefälscht = falsified Gelder = funds veruntreut = embezzled Fehlinformationen = misinformation geschickt = cleverly in die Öffentlichkeit = into the public lanciert = launched 5. Finally, reconstructing the sentence in English: \\"There, balance sheets are falsified, funds embezzled, and misinformation cleverly launched into the public.\\" So, the translated text is: \\"There, balance sheets are falsified, funds embezzled, and misinformation cleverly launched into the public.\\""},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: In the small coastal town of Oceanview, the local community has been concerned about the increasing levels of pollution affecting their shoreline. Over the last decade, the town has grown rapidly, attracting more tourists and businesses. Alongside this growth, there has been a concerning rise in waste production, much of which ends up in the ocean, affecting marine life. The Oceanview community has been organizing beach cleanups regularly and urging the local government to impose stricter regulations on waste management practices. The negative environmental impact has prompted scientists at the Oceanview Marine Research Center to investigate the pollution problem with hopes to identify areas of improvement. The lead scientist, Dr. Ava Thompson, has been studying the effects of waste on marine life for the past six years. Her research primarily focuses on plastic accumulation and its impact on fish populations around the town's shoreline. The data collected over several years shows significant decline in biodiversity and an increase in instances of plastic ingestion by local marine species. Hypothesis: Dr. Thompson and her team at the Oceanview Marine Research Center believe that the decrease in biodiversity and increase in plastic ingestion by local marine species are directly correlated with the increased waste production due to the rise in tourism and business activities in the town. The hypothesis states that the growing pollution problem, especially concerning plastic waste, can be attributed to inadequate waste management practices and the lack of awareness among community members, tourists, and businesses about the consequences of their actions. Based on this hypothesis, the research team will focus on three main factors: the sources of plastic waste, the efficiency of current waste management practices in the town, and the effectiveness of community awareness campaigns. By investigating these factors, the team hopes to identify shortcomings and propose solutions to reduce plastic waste and revitalize the marine ecosystem. Potential outcomes include advocating for stricter regulations on waste disposal, promoting the use of recyclable and biodegradable materials, and increasing public awareness of the negative impact of pollution on marine life and overall ocean health. Ultimately, the goal is to improve waste management practices and restore Oceanview's shoreline and marine ecosystem to their pristine state."},{"question":"Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Hill town had two large forests nearby. Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. and a hint : Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Please answer this question : Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, let's break down the information given in the hint and relate it to the situation of the two forests. Hint analysis: 1. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. 2. In these situations, plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Now let's relate this information to the situation of the two forests: 1. Lake Forest: Has a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating suitable environmental conditions for their growth. 2. Brook Forest: Has lesser arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating that the environmental conditions might be different. From the hint, we can deduce that when the soil nutrient and moisture concentrations are higher, there are fewer AM fungi, and they reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Based on the conditions specified in the situation, Brook Forest has fewer arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Therefore, it is more likely that Brook Forest is the one where AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae due to higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations."},{"question":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I have used this product for quite a long time.

The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. What is an answer for this question: Which group of larvae had more somatic mutations? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, it can be concluded that group L of larvae displayed more somatic mutations. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that group L exhibited various kinds of mutations, whereas group D did not. Somatic mutations, as mentioned, occur in the body cells and are not passed down to the next generation. These mutations can lead to various complications, such as medical conditions or diseases. In contrast, germline mutations occur in sex cells and can be passed down to offspring, potentially causing hereditary diseases. In this particular situation, group L's increased presence of mutations strongly implies that there are more somatic mutations in this group as compared to group D. Although we cannot specifically identify if the observed mutations are solely somatic, the prevalence of mutations in group L suggests that numerous somatic mutations are likely present. Group D, with a lack of observed mutations, would be less likely to have a high number of somatic mutations. It is essential to note that the actual extent and types of the somatic mutations in group L cannot be determined without further analysis or additional information. However, based on the background provided and the observation of different mutations in group L, it is reasonable to infer that group L of larvae had more somatic mutations than group D."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: so wrong, yet so right Review: oh my goodness...where to begin!?! this show is amazing!!! although i don't agree with the whole questioning God/incest/cross-dresser thing, angel sanctuary is still undeniably one of the best anime i have ever seen...definitely one of life's guilty pleasures! =) the characters (and the way in which they react to each other) seem so lifelike, you can't help but fall in love with them, or feel sorry for them (whichever the case may be)! my only complaint is that the story ends without actually ending. how lame is that!?! anyways, i definitely recommend this dvd to anyone over the age of 18 (it's a little too controversial for the kiddies)...enjoy!!!

These may be chronic conditions, or they may pass with time — for example, if you have a bad cough. Risk factors for hernias include: Increased abdominal pressure Coughing Heavy lifting Constipation Pregnancy Obesity Advancing age Smoking Steroid use A hernia is an imperfection in the muscular container of an organ. Because of this imperfection, the organ is pushed through an opening, resulting in a hernia. As the organ comes through the opening, it will create a swollen area or bulge in the skin. A hernia often gets bigger when you are standing or when you are straining. The site of the swollen area may vary depending on what kind hernia you have. The terms for different hernia types refer either to the location or the cause of the hernia. Inguinal - These are hernias occurring in the inguinal region (between the hip bone and crotch) or groin. Umbilical - Occur around the belly button Femoral - Occur along the inner thighs Incisional - Occur when incisions from prior surgeries create weak points in an organ's muscular container Diaphragmatic or hiatal - Occur when there's a congenital defect in the diaphragm If the hernia affects your intestine, it can change or even block the flow of food through your digestive system. This can cause an intestinal back-up that results in nausea and vomiting. If the intestine is not completely blocked, you may just see milder symptoms, like nausea without vomiting or decreased appetite. You may experience constipation if you suffer from an inguinal or femoral hernia low in the body. Constipation is, in essence, the exact opposite of vomiting. When the flow of feces is blocked, you may experience constipation -- instead of it all coming out, it stays in. Needless to say, this symptom necessitates immediate surgical intervention. Hernias can be very serious when they interfere with the functions your body needs in order to survive. If you are experiencing any constipation, see your doctor immediately. Many people with hernias don’t have any complaints of pain or severe or significant noticeable symptoms. But, they may have a feeling of heaviness or fullness in the affected area, especially in the abdomen. You might chalk this up to complaints of bloating. If nothing else, you'll feel keenly aware of your abdominal area, whether it's feeling full, weak, or just has a mysterious pressure. You can relieve the \\"bloating\\" from hernias by resting in a reclined position. Though it's not always present, pain is a sign of hernia — especially if there are complications. Inflammation can cause a burning sensation or sharp pain. Pressure build-up can result in a tearing pain that suggests the hernia is directly touching the muscle walls. Here's how pain affects hernias in different stages: Irreducible hernia: the hernia cannot return to a normal state, but instead gets larger; you may feel occasional pain. Strangulated hernia: the bulging organ is losing its blood supply, and could be dead soon without medical attention. You'll feel significant pain in this case, along with nausea, vomiting, fever, trouble moving your bowels. This condition requires emergency surgery. Hiatal hernia: the stomach bulges out of its cavity, causing chest pains. This also affects the flow of food, causing acid reflux and making it hard to swallow. Untreated hernia: hernias are usually painless and symptomless, but if left untreated, may cause pain and other health problems. All hernias have the potential to become dangerous. If you suspect you have one, you need to see a doctor for evaluation as soon as possible.

This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants’... According to the above context, answer the following question. Why was the author aware of their positionality? OPT: (I) because they were doing research on research evaluation. (II) not enough information. (III) because they were a junior researcher. (IV) because they were British. The answer is:","response":"(I) because they were doing research on research evaluation and (III) because they were a junior researcher. These two options are grounded in the given text. Firstly, the author was in a sensitive role being a researcher studying research evaluation which may have implications for the conclusions drawn or perspectives perceived.

Randall County district attorney James Farren said his motion probably will be amended as he gets additional details about Leaf's latest legal problem. Leaf faces four felonies in Montana after allegedly breaking into a home to steal prescription painkillers, then robbing a second home after being released from jail. \\"I anticipate amending that motion to reflect other potential charges,\\" Farren said. Leaf is likely to face the Montana charges first. He was given 10 years' probation in Texas in 2010 after being accused of burglarizing a player's home while he was a coach at West Texas A&M. An investigation found he obtained nearly 1,000 pain pills from area pharmacies in an eight-month span. Leaf is jailed without bond on a 30-day hold to allow prosecutors in Montana and Texas to sort through the separate cases. Leaf's Texas attorney, Bill Kelly, declined to comment because he had not seen the motion. Farren said he is fine with Montana proceeding with its case first, though \\"our process would probably be shorter because revocation doesn't take as long\\" as getting a case to trial. Late last week, Cascade County (Mont.) prosecutor John Parker charged Leaf with two counts of burglary and two counts of criminal possession of a dangerous drug. If convicted, Leaf faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years on each burglary charge and five years for each possession charge. Should the judge in Leaf's Texas case revoke his probation, the former Washington State standout and the No. 2 pick in the 1998 NFL draft, could be sentenced to 20 years. The revocation motion cites Leaf's admission twice to a probation officer in Montana that he had taken oxycodone pills not prescribed to him. Leaf was arrested March 30 and again in the early morning hours of April 2. Authorities said that both times he was found in possession of oxycodone. Charging documents in Montana say Leaf's arrest was the culmination of a monthlong investigation by the Central Montana Task Force that began when Great Falls postal workers tipped authorities that Leaf was receiving frequent packages and paying more than 500 cash on delivery for each. Last year, Leaf had surgery to remove a benign tumor from his brain stem and later underwent additional radiation treatments. Leaf's publicist released a statement from the ex-quarterback after his first arrest that said Leaf has \\"made some mistakes and have no excuses\\" but that he is \\"confident that there will be further understanding when the facts are revealed.\\"","response":"A man named Ryan Leaf, who used to play football, is in trouble with the law.

For most of that time, he was a co-host of the political debate program \\"Crossfire.\\" But he also hosted a show with his longtime column co-author, Rowland Evans, and appeared as a panelist on shows like \\"The Capital Gang\\" and on PBS' \\"The McLaughlin Group.\\" Novak got his first newspaper job in 1948, when he was still in high school. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Novak had \\"the kind of keen insight that can only be gained through years and years of dedication to a craft.\\" \\"He was a Washington institution who could turn an idea into the most discussed story around kitchen tables, congressional offices, the White House and everywhere in between,\\" McConnell said in a written statement. Novak served in the Army during the Korean War before turning to the news business, eventually starting his column with Evans at the now-defunct New York Herald-Tribune in 1963. In 2003, he found himself at the center of the scandal over the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson, when he published a column revealing her CIA status days after her husband challenged a key Bush administration justification for the invasion of Iraq. While staunchly conservative, Novak opposed the invasion and was frequently critical of the Bush administration. He cooperated with prosecutors and was not charged in the leak case. The scandal ultimately led to the conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators probing the leak. Novak later testified that the leak began with then-Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and was confirmed by Karl Rove, who was then President George W. Bush's top political adviser. Both men cooperated with the investigation, and neither was charged. iReport.com: Share memories of Novak. Novak was born to a Jewish family in Joliet, Illinois, on the outskirts of Chicago, but later became a devout Roman Catholic. He took up skydiving in his early 70s and was a passionate sports fan. He also once appeared as an extra in a Washington opera production. In an editorial published with news of Novak's death, the Sun-Times said Novak's columns \\"were marked by his determination to dig out new information.\\" \\"He combined that with sharp analysis, insightful commentary and passion about the issues facing the nation to emerge as a brawling contestant in the great national debates of his era,\\" the newspaper said. Veteran Democratic consultant and on-air sparring partner James Carville said Novak \\"had the best sources in the Republican Party,\\" making his weekly column a must-read for political insiders. \\"What you saw on television was an ideological guy, a fire-breathing right-wing guy,\\" Carville said. But Novak \\"still had the sort of ethos of the reporter.\\" Novak left the network in 2005 after an on-air blowup with Carville, who had been needling him over the CIA leak case. CNN suspended Novak, who apologized for using the word \\"bullsh*t\\" on air, and he resigned at the end of the year. \\"I want to thank CNN for making this network available to me for 25 years,\\" he said at the time. \\"Never censored me once, ever, and I said some outrageous things. And it was a wonderful opportunity for me.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"Robert Novak, a TV host and news writer, has passed away after fighting cancer for a year.

Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. But I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: What is an answer for this question: Which farmer helped to stabilize the soil more? A:","response":"Based on the provided information, it is evident that Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, helped to stabilize the soil more. The implementation of agroforestry practices has a significant impact on soil health, and the growth of cover crops further aids in soil stabilization and fertility. Let's delve deeper into the advantages of Gary's approach and how it contributed to better soil stabilization: 1. Agroforestry systems: By incorporating trees and shrubs alongside agricultural crops, Gary created an integrated ecosystem that significantly reduces the risk of soil erosion. The root systems of the trees not only hold the soil together but also create pathways for water to infiltrate, thereby reducing surface runoff and soil erosion potential. 2. Cover crops: Gary's decision to grow cover crops complements the benefits of his agroforestry system. Cover crops, being groundcover plants, protect the soil surface from the direct impact of raindrops and wind, which can dislodge soil particles and cause erosion. Their root systems also contribute to soil structure improvement, allowing for better water infiltration and reducing the speed of surface runoff. 3. Nutrient cycling: Through the growth of cover crops and the integration of trees in his agroforestry system, Gary was able to increase nutrient cycling in his soil. The roots of the cover crops and trees can penetrate deeper into the soil, making nutrients more accessible to the plants. Furthermore, the organic matter provided by the trees and cover crops decomposes, gradually releasing nutrients back into the soil. 4. Reduced nutrient loss: As explained in the background information, agroforestry systems like the one used by Gary can reduce nutrient loss into streams. The dense vegetation buffers and slowdown runoff, preventing nutrient leaching and preserving soil fertility. 5. Improved plant growth: The combined effect of agroforestry and cover cropping provides a healthy environment for plant growth. The improved soil structure and nutrient availability lead to increased overall crop productivity, while the trees and cover crops themselves offer additional benefits, such as habitat for beneficial insects and microorganisms, which further aid in the stabilization and enrichment of the soil. In conclusion, Gary, with his agroforestry system and cover crops, significantly contributed to soil stabilization on his farm. This approach not only protects the soil from erosion but also improves soil fertility and offers various ecological benefits, making his farming practices more sustainable than Joe's farm with depleted soil."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: Weekend at Bernie's Movie plot: Larry Wilson (McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Silverman) are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers mismatched payments. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partners, Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed and arrange it to look like a murder-suicide. However, after Bernie leaves the gangsters decide Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his grabbiness as well as his fooling around with a girlfriend of one of the mobsters, and order that he be killed instead.Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and speaks to the hitman Paulie (Don Calfa) on the phone, planning the murders and establishing an alibi, unaware the conversation is being recorded on Bernie's answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, injects Bernie with a fatal overdose, then plants heroin on him. When Larry and Richard arrive at the beach house, they find their boss's body.

He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew.

Choose your answer from: + description + entity + abbreviation + human + numeric + location","response":"The question \\"What are common methods used to regulate monopolies?\\" is asking about a description. A description question typically seeks information about processes, methods, or characteristics of a particular subject. In this case, the subject is \\"monopolies,\\" and the question aims to gather information about the methods or regulations that are commonly used to control them. Monopolies are a market situation in which there is only one seller or provider of a particular product or service. While some monopolies may occur naturally, others could potentially exploit their market position to the detriment of consumers or other businesses. Therefore, it's crucial to understand various methods and regulations that exist to maintain fair competition and protect consumer interests. Several common methods can be employed by government or regulatory agencies to regulate or control monopolies, including: 1. Anti-trust laws: These laws are designed to prevent businesses from engaging in anticompetitive practices such as price-fixing or collusion and to break up existing monopolies if they are found to be harming consumers or the market. 2. Price controls: Governments can impose price controls on monopolistic firms to ensure they do not use their market dominance to charge excessive prices. 3. Rate-of-return regulation: Under this type of regulation, a monopolistic firm is allowed to set a price that's high enough to cover its costs and earn a fair rate of return on its investments. 4. Promoting competition: Authorities can encourage competition in monopolistic industries by removing barriers to entry, licensing new market participants, or providing financial incentives for new entrants. 5. Direct regulation: In some cases, the government may take direct control of a natural monopoly, such as a public utility, to ensure that consumers get the best service at the lowest possible prices. 6. Market liberalization: By deregulating monopolistic industries, the government can create a more competitive environment, encouraging new entrants and fostering innovation. 7. Merger control: Authorities can scrutinize proposed mergers and acquisitions to prevent the formation of monopolies or market concentration that could lead to anticompetitive behavior. To sum up, the question is asking for a description of common methods employed to regulate monopolies and maintain fair competition in the market. This knowledge is vital to ensure that consumer interests are protected and businesses get the opportunity to grow and innovate, ultimately contributing to the overall health of the economy."},{"question":"The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year. Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea? Hint: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope). The answer to this question is:","response":"The Danube River's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea compared to the Volga River. The formation of river deltas depends on various factors, including river flow velocity, sediment load, and the characteristics of the receiving body of water. The Danube River, originating in Germany and flowing through central and eastern Europe, is the second longest in Europe, stretching over 2,850 kilometers. The Danube Delta, extending across Romania and Ukraine, is the largest and best-preserved delta in Europe, spanning over 4,100 square kilometers. The delta has a high sediment load due to the vast drainage basin of the Danube River, which covers an area of about 800,000 square kilometers. As the river's discharge enters the Black Sea, the decrease in its confinement and the presence of a large basin with comparatively stable sea levels contribute to a rapid drop in its flow velocity. This decrease in velocity causes the river to deposit most of its sediment load in the delta as it can no longer transport the sediment effectively. The high sediment load, combined with the relatively low-energy currents of the Black Sea, allows the Danube Delta to grow quickly every year. On the other hand, the Volga River is the longest and largest river in Europe, with a length of 3,530 kilometers, flowing through western Russia before discharging into the Caspian Sea. The Volga Delta covers an area of about 27,000 square kilometers but carries a smaller sediment load due to the smaller drainage basin, which extends over approximately 1.3 million square kilometers. The Caspian Sea has stronger tidal currents compared to the Black Sea, meaning that sediment gets washed out and dispersed more effectively, preventing the rapid accumulation of sediment in the Volga Delta. Consequently, the Volga River's speed does not decrease as rapidly when it enters the sea since a significant portion of its sediment load gets carried away by the tidal currents. Therefore, the Danube River's speed decreases more rapidly than the Volga River's as it reaches the sea, mainly due to the combination of a high sediment load, the characteristics of the receiving body of water, and the relatively stable conditions in the receiving basin. This results in the larger and faster-growing Danube Delta compared to the Volga Delta."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

However, it is worth noting that the rephrased version of the statement may be considered less clear or formal than the original. The use of \\"not make bad things happen\\" could be deemed informal or imprecise when compared to the more specific wording of \\"prevent these bad things\\" used in the original statement. Additionally, the inclusion of \\"said the news\\" in the rephrased statement provides a vague source for the information, which could potentially be unhelpful or misleading for some readers. In conclusion, both statements essentially convey the same meaning, though the original statement may be perceived as clearer and more specific in its wording.

Over the past few decades, there has been a noticeable decrease in the number of bees, specifically honeybees (Apis mellifera). As pollinators, bees play a crucial role in maintaining the equilibrium of ecosystems and ensuring the reproduction of a wide variety of plant species. Many of the world's food crops depend on pollinators, which makes the decline of bee populations a matter of global food security. Several factors have been identified as contributing to this decline, including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, climate change, and the spread of parasites and diseases among colonies. Hypothesis: Introducing flower-rich habitats within modern agricultural landscapes could potentially improve the overall health and reproductive capacity of bee populations, thus reversing the current decline. This approach would diversify the foraging resources available to bees, strengthen their resilience against environmental stresses, and provide a more stable environment for the long-term survival of these important pollinator species. By introducing flower-rich habitats within modern agricultural landscapes, we aim to achieve the following objectives: 1. Enhance biodiversity: A diverse array of flowering plants would attract a more extensive range of pollinator species, which in turn would support ecosystem functionality and stability. The result would be improved pollination of both wild plants and cultivated crops. 2. Improve bee nutrition: Ensuring that bees have access to a wide variety of flowering plants is essential for their overall health. A diverse diet benefits bees by strengthening their immune systems and enabling them to resist diseases and parasites more effectively. 3. Boost colony productivity: Colonies with access to diverse food sources can rear more brood and produce more honey. This would support larger, more robust colonies, which can better withstand the various stressors threatening bee populations. 4. Avoid pesticide exposure: Establishing pollinator-friendly habitat areas away from pesticide-treated crops can help protect bees by reducing their exposure to harmful chemicals. 5. Encourage natural pest management: By attracting a range of beneficial insects, flower-rich habitats can offer an alternative to chemical pest control, contributing to the reduction of pesticide usage and reliance. To test this hypothesis, experimental plots featuring a mix of native flowering plants could be established within various agricultural landscapes. Researchers would monitor the bee populations of these habitats, as well as those in control plots with no added flowers, over several years to assess the overall health, reproductive capacity, and diversity of the pollinator communities. Data on crop yield and quality in the surrounding area would also be collected to determine whether enhanced pollination services contribute to increased agricultural productivity. In conclusion, implementing flower-rich habitats as part of modern agricultural systems could have significant benefits for bee populations and may provide a valuable strategy for mitigating the global decline in their numbers. By providing bees with diverse and nutritious foraging resources, these habitats may help improve their resilience, overall health, and reproductive potential. Furthermore, healthier bee populations would, in turn, contribute to a more robust ecosystem and potentially greater crop yields through enhanced pollination services."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which happened earlier, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration or the declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster? Context: The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.

Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument.

Brownell allegedly assaulted the musicians near 21st and O streets about 11:45 p.m. Sunday. Police reported Tuesday evening that Brownell had turned himself in and was in custody at the Sacramento County Jail. Brownell allegedly uttered “sexual orientation epithets” before attacking the musicians, according to a press release by the Police Department. 20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now! Police had arrested Brownell on Sunday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and illegal possession of a firearm. Officers said they found guns at Brownell’s residence when they arrested him. “The Sacramento Police Department has zero tolerance for these crimes,” the department said in a news release Monday evening. In social media posts, the injured musicians all said their attacker referred to them with homophobic slurs because they were wearing skinny jeans. Slaves guitarist Alex Lyman posted on Instagram that he suffered a 4-inch stab in his side not far from his spleen. Another guitarist, Weston Richmond, broke his right hand and had minor cuts. The band posted on Facebook that it will still headline the Sacramento Concerts in the Park event Friday, though Richmond will not be able to perform. Blake Abbey, the lead singer for local band Musical Charis, said on his Facebook page that he was stabbed in the arm and required surgery. Slaves is composed of Sacramento musicians who previously played in other area bands, including former Dance Gavin Dance lead vocalist Jonny Craig. The band released its only album in June 2014 and has more than 94,000 fans on Facebook. Sacramento police spokesman Officer Justin Brown had earlier said alcohol was also a factor in the assault.

The tweet discusses someone being at a credit union, with the situation suggesting that the person is looking for someone to help or adopt a cat (referred to as \\"kitteh\\"). However, the tweet mentions \\"nobody there can take him,\\" which indicates that the person has been unsuccessful in finding someone to tend to the cat. This is followed by the statement \\"talking about putting him outside 2nite\\" (tonight), which implies that the cat might end up spending the night outdoors, unprotected. Based on this context, we can analyze the sentiment expressed in the tweet. The tweet has a predominantly negative sentiment, as it talks about a dire and urgent \\"kitteh situation.\\" The writer seems concerned and slightly desperate, as they are actively trying to find a solution for the cat but are unable to succeed. By using the word \\"urgent,\\" the author emphasizes their need for immediate help for the cat. Anxiety and frustration are also present in the sentiment due to the unsuccessful search for assistance. The writer mentions that nobody at the credit union can take the cat, which conveys a sense of hopelessness or disappointment. This desperation intensifies with the idea of putting the cat outside, especially if it implies leaving the cat to the mercy of the environment and without shelter. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is largely negative, marked by concern, frustration, and a sense of urgency. The author clearly cares about the well-being of the cat and is seeking help to improve its current situation, but has been met with disappointment and an inability to find a solution. This sense of despair is evident throughout the tweet, making it primarily negative in sentiment."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: Who plays Kristan's fiance?

It took more than 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and when they finally did, they were half empty. The main dish I ordered, the grilled salmon, was overcooked and smothered in a bland sauce, which did nothing to enhance the flavor. My partner's dish, the linguine Alfredo, had noodles that were clumped together and an overpowering garlic taste. The acoustics in the dining area made it difficult to have a conversation, as the noise level was quite high. The dim lighting also made it challenging to read the menu and see the food clearly.

Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City.

The vagrants and homeless are being moved elsewhere in the city as downtown LA booms. Article:","response":"Title: Gentrification in Los Angeles: Effects on Skid Row's Homeless and the Booming Downtown Over the years, renowned photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has captured the continuously changing landscapes of American cities. One of his most visually striking subjects has been Los Angeles, a city whose notorious Skid Row has long been a sobering reminder of socio-economic disparities. Recently, Vergara has documented the area's dramatic transformation as gentrification takes hold. A once drug-infested and crime-ridden pocket of neglected urban dwellers is starting to show signs of progress, as vagrants and homeless people are relocated to other areas in the city. Meanwhile, downtown LA is experiencing a significant economic boom, with new businesses, high-end condos, and trendy eateries taking over the once-grim streets. Known for its high number of transients, Skid Row was often seen as a tainted and dubious area to avoid by most in Los Angeles. With more than half of its residents living in tents, makeshift shelters, or campers, it had become the nation's homeless capital. In recent years, however, city planners have slowly integrated strategies to reclaim and revitalize the area. Incrementally, charity organizations, activists, and the local government have taken action to better support Skid Row's residents and improve their living conditions. The city's relentless gentrification – a seemingly unstoppable force that drives change and reshapes urban landscapes – has forced many of Skid Row's homeless inhabitants to move elsewhere in Los Angeles. In some cases, relocated individuals have been offered proper housing, social support, and health facilities. For others, the relocation has led to an uncertain future and further marginalization. Regardless of the outcome, Skid Row's notorious image as a center for crime, drug addiction, and desperation is slowly fading away. As Skid Row goes through its metamorphosis, downtown Los Angeles is catching the eye of investors, developers, and young professionals. The once-hidden gem that is the city's beautiful, historic architecture is being exhumed and polished with many former warehouse spaces, and industrial buildings being converted into fashionable lofts and commercial spaces. With an influx of new businesses, a growing arts and culture scene, and increased demand for luxury residences, downtown LA has now become one of the most coveted areas for real estate in the city. This vibrant revival has undoubtedly led to economic growth, but it simultaneously challenges the delicate social fabric that supports Los Angeles' disenfranchised communities. Though the city's economy is flourishing, the rapid rise of new development projects, and soaring housing costs pose a threat to long-time, low-income residents. As the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, the question remains: can downtown LA's growth be sustained without sacrificing the well-being and stability of its most vulnerable populations? Recovering from decades of urban turmoil and enacting policies that benefit all stakeholders is a complex and daunting task. While gentrification may bring promising economic growth to areas like downtown LA, it is crucial to weigh the benefits of such development against the potential risks at hand. With careful planning, Los Angeles can ensure that the adverse effects of gentrification on vulnerable communities are minimized, all while fostering balanced, sustainable urban growth across the city. Camilo Jose Vergara's work serves as a powerful visual testament to the rapid changes occurring in Los Angeles. Through his lens, we can examine the consequences of gentrification on Skid Row's homeless population, and explore the economic boom that has resulted from downtown LA's transformation. While some may view the current urban developments as a significant step forward for the city, it remains crucial to maintain a balance between economic growth and social equity, ensuring the well-being of all residents, regardless of their socio-economic background."},{"question":"How similar are the following two sentences?

He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A. Then he labeled climate as term B. He found it easier to understand their differences in that way. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which changes less frequently, term A or term B? Answer:","response":"Term B changes less frequently. In the given paragraph, term A refers to weather, and term B refers to climate. The difference between these two concepts lies primarily in the time frames over which they are observed and analyzed. Weather, or term A, refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions experienced in a specific location. It includes factors like temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and visibility, which can change constantly throughout the day. Weather can be described as the particular atmospheric conditions we experience at any given moment. On the other hand, climate, or term B, represents the long-term average of weather patterns in a particular region over an extended time period, typically measured over several decades. Climate encompasses the trends, averages, and variations in weather conditions over these long time scales. It takes into account factors such as seasonal differences, average temperatures, precipitation patterns, and other meteorological elements that provide a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions of a specific area. Since climate represents a longer-term overview of weather patterns, it inherently changes less frequently than weather. Weather can change from one day to the next or even within a single day, while climate is a relatively stable description of the average weather conditions over an extended time. Understanding this fundamental difference between weather and climate is essential to addressing and analyzing climate change issues, as it provides necessary context for understanding the changes in Earth's climate system and their potential consequences on our global environment."},{"question":"Given the question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Kennewick, Washington.

Question: A flask is a container can, it is made to hold what? Options: A. fire B. store C. contain food D. garage E. liquid Answer:","response":"E. Liquid A flask is a container that is specifically designed to hold liquids, such as beverages, soups, or other liquid substances. Traditionally, flasks have been used for carrying alcoholic beverages, but they are also widely used to transport various non-alcoholic liquids, such as water, coffee, tea, or even hot chocolate. The primary purpose of a flask is to provide a portable and convenient method for individuals to carry a liquid with them while they are on-the-go. Flasks are constructed in a range of materials, including stainless steel, glass, and plastic. These materials are specifically chosen for their ability to maintain the temperature of the liquid contents and to avoid altering the taste. Most flasks also feature airtight caps that prevent leaks and spills, ensuring the container remains secure during transportation. Some flasks even include insulation properties, such as vacuum-sealed or double-walled designs, that help maintain the temperature of hot or cold liquids for an extended period. In contrast, the other options provided in the question are either not relevant to the purpose of a flask or simply do not make sense as suitable contents for it. A. Fire - A flask is not designed to hold fire or any type of flame, as doing so would create a safety hazard and most certainly damage the container. B. Store - While a flask may be used to store liquid, the term \\"store\\" itself does not represent any specific content that could be held in a flask. C. Contain food - While some flasks are designed to keep food in liquid form, such as soups and sauces, they are not typically meant for holding solid food items. D. Garage - A garage is a structure or building used for storing vehicles and other items, and it does not represent any content suitable for being held in a flask. It is evident that option E, \\"liquid,\\" is the most logical and common-sense choice for the content that a flask is made to hold. By ensuring the container is secure, convenient, and constructed with materials best suited for maintaining the integrity of liquid contents, flasks are an ideal solution for individuals who want to carry a liquid while on-the-go."},{"question":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to become a ted translator Make sure you are sufficiently fluent in the spoken source language.

Here are possible answers to this question: - work - industrial complex - city - new york - suburbia I believe the correct choice is \\"city\\", here's why: A:","response":"Yes, the correct choice is \\"city.\\" Cities, compared to the other options provided, generally have higher concentrations of commercial areas and business districts, making them the most likely places to see multiple office buildings clustered together. However, let me elaborate on why the other options might not be as fitting: - \\"Work\\" is quite broad and does not specifically refer to places with multiple office buildings. Work could mean a variety of settings such as a small store or a factory. - \\"Industrial complex\\" refers to an area where multiple industrial facilities or businesses are located, which may or may not have office buildings. Though some industrial complexes contain office buildings, they are typically more associated with manufacturing or production facilities. - \\"New York\\" could refer to either New York City or New York state, but given that it is a more specific location, it may not be the most suitable answer for a general question. Nonetheless, it is true that New York City does contain many office buildings. - \\"Suburbia\\" generally refers to residential suburban neighborhoods, which are not primarily known for having multiple office buildings. While it is possible to find some office buildings in suburbs, they are typically far less concentrated than in city centers. Therefore, \\"city\\" is the most appropriate choice among these options, as it is a general term that encompasses urban areas with concentrated commercial and business districts where multiple office buildings are more likely to be found."},{"question":"Principales activités et calendrier: L'Équipe spéciale des POP: Translate this to English?","response":"As an AI, I will now proceed to translate the text from French to English: Original text in French: \\"Principales activités et calendrier: L'Équipe spéciale des POP\\" 1.

Select a longer table for a larger room because a small table will be dwarfed in the space. Similarly, use a small table in a small room. And find a table that will accommodate all of the elements you want to use to style your table. For example, if you have several large coffee table books or other decorative items you want to show off, find a table that won't be overwhelmed by your books or other items. Consider the purpose of your coffee table and the overall style of the room. If you plan on entertaining guests, choose a table that is both functional and stylish, possibly featuring additional storage options such as built-in drawers or shelves. These features on a coffee table can help you create a balanced and well-organized display while also keeping your space tidy. When choosing the shape of your coffee table, consider the furniture placement and seating arrangements in the room. A round or oval table works well in smaller spaces and can create a more intimate environment. In contrast, a rectangular or square table is perfect for larger rooms or when the table will be used as a central focal point for the room design. In addition to the size and shape of your coffee table, consider the materials used for construction. Materials such as wood, glass, and metal can contribute to an overall theme and style for your room. For example, a glass or metal table can give a modern, minimalist feel to your space, while a wood table can add warmth and texture to a more traditional setting. Color and finish options are also essential factors to consider when styling your table. Choose a coffee table that complements your existing color scheme, or opt for a contrasting color to create a standout feature in the room. You can also choose a finish that enhances the overall style of your space - for instance, distressed wood for rustic or farmhouse-inspired rooms, or polished metal for a sleek, contemporary look. Lastly, think about the accessories and decorations you want to feature on your coffee table. Layering items such as books, trays, vases, and candles can create visual interest and add depth to your display. Ensure the items you select for your table serve a purpose, such as adding a pop of color, featuring interesting textures, or serving as conversation starters. You can also incorporate personal items such as family heirlooms or travel souvenirs that hold sentimental value and make your coffee table a true reflection of your personality and style. In conclusion, to style your coffee table, take into consideration the size, shape, materials, color, finish, and decorations that best suit your space and overall design aesthetic. By carefully selecting the right components, you can create a beautiful and functional coffee table display that enhances the style of your room and reflects your unique personality."},{"question":"A black hole is created when a large star burns out. Like our sun, stars are unbelievably hot furnaces that burn their own matter as fuel. When most of the fuel is used up, the star begins to die. The death of a star is not a quiet event. First there is a huge explosion. As its outer layer is blasted off into space, the dying star shines as brightly as a billion suns. After the explosion gravity pulls in what's left of the star. As the outside of the star sinks toward the center, the star gets smaller and smaller. The material the star is made of becomes tightly packed together. A star is so dense that a teaspoon of matter from it weighs billion of pounds. The more the star shrinks, the stronger the gravity inside it becomes. Soon the star is very tiny, and the gravity pulling it in is unbelievably strong. In fact, the gravity is so strong that it even pulls light into the star! Since all the light is pulled in, none can go out. The star becomes black when there is no light. Then a black hole is born! That's what we know about black holes. What we don't know is this: What happens inside a black hole after the star has been squeezed into a tiny ball? Does it keep getting smaller and smaller forever? Such a possibility is hard to imagine. But if the black hole doesn't keep shrinking, what happens to it? Some scientists think black holes are like doorways to another world. They say that as the star disappears from our universe, it goes into another universe. In other words a black hole in our universe could turn into a \\"white hole\\" in a different universe. As the black hole swallows light, the white hole shines brightly--somewhere else. But where? A different place, perhaps, or a different time -- many years in the past or future. Could you travel through a black hole? Right now, no. Nothing we know of could go into a black hole without being crushed. So far the time being, black hole must remain a mystery. Black holes are a mystery--but that hasn't stopped scientists from dreaming about them. One scientist... When the star begins to die _ . A) there is no fuel left in it B) its outer layer goes into space first C) a huge explosion will happen D) it doesn't give off light any longer Answer:","response":"C) a huge explosion will happen"},{"question":"Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Row, row, row your boat...

Typically, these exams are administered in the state of New York and are known as the New York State Regents examinations. In order to provide an accurate answer, I will focus on the requirements set by the New York State Education Department (NYSED). The NYSED has established that students generally need to achieve a score of 65 or higher on the Regents examinations to be considered passing and meet graduation requirements. Passing the required Regents exams with a score of 65 or higher demonstrates mastery in the subjects being tested and contributes to fulfilling the necessary high school credits for graduation. However, there are variations in requirements based on the different diploma options available to students. Here's a breakdown of the diploma options and their corresponding Regents examination requirements: 1. Regents Diploma: - Students need to pass five Regents exams in core subjects: English Language Arts, one in Mathematics, one in Science, one in Social Studies (Global History and Geography, or United States History and Government), and one additional exam in a different subject. - All five Regents exams should be passed with a minimum score of 65. 2. Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation: - Students need to pass eight or nine Regents exams, depending on the chosen Language Other Than English (LOTE) option. - Required exams consist of English Language Arts, three in Mathematics (Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II), two in Science (one life science and one physical science), and two in Social Studies (Global History and Geography, and United States History and Government). - All eight or nine Regents exams should be passed with a minimum score of 65. 3. Local Diploma (for students with disabilities): - The standard score required to pass is 55 in the five Regents exams for a Local Diploma. These include English Language Arts, one in Mathematics, one in Science, one in Social Studies (Global History and Geography, or United States History and Government), and one additional exam in a different subject. - Additionally, there is an option called the \\"low pass\\" or \\"55-64\\" option, which allows students with disabilities to graduate with a Local Diploma if they score between 55 and 64 on one or more required Regents exams (except for ELA and Math), provided they make up for the lower scores by scoring 65 or higher on other exams. 4. NYS CDOS (New York State Career Development and Occupational Studies) Commencement Credential: - This diploma option is for students with disabilities who are unable to meet the standard Local Diploma requirements. They can still receive an employability profile that demonstrates skills and achievements relevant to the workplace. While the CDOS itself does not involve Regents exams, it can be combined with a Regents or Local Diploma by following the respective examination requirements. Keep in mind that individual schools and school districts may have additional requirements, and specific courses or assessment versions may change over time. It is essential to consult your school's guidance counselor regularly for the most up-to-date information on graduation requirements and available diploma options."},{"question":"a windmill does not create pollution What is safest to breathe around? Possible answers: 1). coal plant 2). Union Carbide plant 3). windmill 4). automobile","response":"3). windmill A windmill is the safest to breathe around compared to the other options.

Yet they have changed a lot since 1804, when the first train moved at 8 km/hr. Today's high speed trains can go 300 km/hr or faster. Besides their speed, they have many advantages over other transportation types. Japan built the world's first high speed railway. In 1964, Japan's \\"Shinkansen\\" trains started traveling between Osaka and Tokyo at 200 km/hr. Over time, more lines, as well as faster trains, were built. Korea, England, and the USA, now have their own high speed systems. Taiwan Province's started running in 2007. Its trains are based on two types of Shinkansen trains. They can carry 989 people and travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in less than two hours. These systems are expensive to build, but they have many advantages. For example, they are good for the environment. Trains on the London to Paris line create 1/10 the pollution that planes create. High speed trains are also safer and cleaner than cars. Super fast trains can even help a country's economy . They make it easier to travel to faraway places. That helps businesses and land values in those areas.

That's when default letters come in. A default letter is like a friendly reminder to the person who is not keeping their promise. It tells them about their promise and that they need to correct their mistake. Contracts for default letters help us make sure that everyone knows what they promised and what they need to do if they don't keep their promises. It's a way to keep things fair and avoid fights. I hope this explanation helps you understand the importance of contracts for default letters. If you have any questions or need more information, please feel free to ask. Thank you and have a great day! Best regards, [Your Name]"},{"question":"(options at the end).

Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical.

I still miss my folks so much , Mom always the tough one and Dad the teacher and best friend . I miss his words of wisdom and all his quick come backs , I guess I got them honestly . I visited where my Grandparents are buried and most of my Aunts and Uncles , their generation is almost gone . It 's kind of scary , the place I called home really does n't have a lot of family left , just great memories of times gone by . Question: What may be the reason they are feeling so sad ?","response":"The feeling of sadness that the person is experiencing might be attributed to several factors: 1. Loss and Grief: The person appears to have lost their parents - their mother, who was always the tough one, and father, who was their teacher and best friend. Losing such close family members can lead to a sense of grief, longing, and sadness that may linger for an extended period. 2. Nostalgia and Connection to the Past: The person mentioned visiting their grandparents, aunts, and uncles' graves, realizing that their generation is almost gone. This situation can evoke a sense of nostalgia for the past, including memories of times spent together, and growing up in their hometown. The fading away of a generation can leave one feeling isolated and disconnected from their roots. 3. Changes in Family Structure: As the older generation passes on, family dynamics and structures change, which can sometimes lead to strong feelings of sadness and longing for the days when those loved ones were still present. The sense of loss, combined with changes in relationships and connections, might contribute significantly to their emotions. 4. Reflecting on Personal Growth: As people age, they might become more reflective about their own lives and the path they have taken. This retrospection can sometimes lead to feelings of sadness, as the person realizes that the world they once knew has changed dramatically, and they are unable to turn back time. 5. Fear of Mortality: The awareness that the generation before them is almost gone can evoke a sense of fear and sadness related to their own mortality. Faced with the transitory nature of life, they might begin to question the meaning and purpose of existence, which can be a source of emotional distress. 6. Difficulty in Accepting Change: Lastly, some people have a hard time accepting changes in their lives and adapting to new situations. This inability to cope with change may also contribute to the sadness that they're feeling, as they long for the comfort and familiarity of their past experiences and wish to return to those times. In summary, the person is feeling sad due to a combination of factors related to loss, nostalgia, changes in family structure, personal growth, fear of mortality, and difficulty accepting change. It is essential to acknowledge and process these emotions to come to terms with their experiences and work through the grieving process. Emotional support from friends, family, and professional counselors can help them during this time of healing and self-discovery."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

In July, he said Mrs Clinton had been careless but not criminal in handling sensitive material on her private email server while secretary of state. The issue flared up again with the discovery of new \\"pertinent\\" emails. They were reportedly found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of the Democratic presidential candidate's closest advisers. Mr Comey's letter to Congress late last month, revealing the bureau's inquiry into Mrs Clinton's emails had been revived, shook up the White House race and reinvigorated the campaign of Republican nominee Donald Trump. It was much ado about nothing, but it certainly amounted to something. While FBI Director James Comey, in effect, said \\"never mind\\" with regards to Hillary Clinton's emails, for the past two weeks the story has dominated the political conversation, and Democrats have paid a price. While Mrs Clinton's presidential hopes have stabilised, talk of a possible rout - and sweeping down-ballot victories in congressional races - are a distant memory. Mrs Clinton will now try to focus on her closing campaign message. Donald Trump almost certainly will continue to accuse his opponent of corruption and, perhaps, again allege the FBI is covering for her. With only two days until voting, the dust kicked up by this story won't have fully settled by the time Americans head to the polls. Once this election is over, there should be serious soul-searching within the FBI and the media about how this saga played out. The nation's top law-enforcement agency was a source of constant leaks, as internal disputes spilled into public view. If Mr Trump wins, many on the left will blame Mr Comey for the result. If Mrs Clinton prevails, she likely will bear a lasting grudge over this political near-miss. How FBI email verdict affects election The FBI director had announced that the agency would investigate if the newly discovered messages contained classified information. But in Sunday's follow-up, Mr Comey wrote: \\"Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation. \\"During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. \\"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\\" On board the candidate's campaign airplane, her team said they were always confident of the outcome. Communications director Jennifer Palmieri told media: \\"We're glad this matter has been resolved.\\" But the Trump team cried foul. Newt Gingrich, an adviser to the Republican nominee, tweeted: \\"Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he cant [sic] possibly know.\\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted: \\"If FBI conclusions remain unchanged, that means she still was reckless & careless, still lied about classified info, lied re: # of devices.\\" Campaigning in Minnesota on Sunday, Mr Trump made no mention of Mr Comey's findings. But he did say Mrs Clinton \\"will be under investigation for a long, long time, likely concluding in a criminal trial\\". He also renewed his claims that the Democrat was being \\"protected by a rigged system\\". The FBI has already established Mrs Clinton had classified information on a private email server that was run out of her upstate New York home. Mr Comey said in July that her handling of sensitive material during her 2009-13 tenure as secretary of state was \\"extremely careless\\", but cleared her of criminal wrongdoing. The revelation that she handled sensitive information while breaking federal rules by running her own email server has dogged her campaign since last year. A new NBC/Wall St Journal opinion poll on Sunday before news broke of the FBI letter suggested a four-point lead for Mrs Clinton. The latest Washington Post/ABC tracking poll put her lead at five points. Sunday's campaign stops take her to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Also on Mr Trump's itinerary were Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Who is ahead in the polls? 48% Hillary Clinton 44% Donald Trump Last updated November 8, 2016 Who will win? Play our game to make your call","response":"The FBI director, James Comey, told everyone that they looked at some new emails and didn't find anything bad about Hillary Clinton. This is important because Hillary is trying to become the next leader of the United States. Some people are happy the FBI didn't find anything bad, but others still think Hillary did something wrong.

Cyrus praised Michael Landsberry and presented a memorial plaque to his widow, Sharon, during a concert Saturday night in Incline Village, a Nevada community on north shore of Lake Tahoe. Police say Landsberry, a 45-year-old ex-Marine, tried to talk the shooter, 12-year-old Jose Reyes, into turning over the handgun before he was shot in the chest Oct. 21 at a middle school in the Reno suburb of Sparks. The student wounded two classmates before taking his life. Hero: Billy Ray Cyrus meets with the widow of Michael Landsberry, whom the country star lauded as a hero on Saturday. 'Tonight we are here to honor a true American hero,' Cyrus told a crowd of over 1,000. 'Michael Landsberry made the ultimate sacrifice to save his students after serving three terms in Afghanistan.' Cyrus said Landsberry also represented the courage of the Vietnam veteran honored in his patriotic song, Some Gave All. With a large photograph of Landsberry in the background and the math teacher's widow on stage, Cyrus led the crowd in singing the song. Cyrus said he was moved by the story of Landsberry's actions in the school shooting and decided to recognize him when offered a chance to perform at Lake Tahoe. He and his father, Ronald Ray Cyrus, made similar presentations honoring American heroes for more than a decade, and this marked the first time the country star has done so since his father's 2006 death. 'Just about every year, my dad and I would find an unsung hero and present them with a Some Gave All' award,' he told The Associated Press. 'I kind of play everything by ear, and I thought sometime when the time is right, I would love to recognize the sacrifice Michael made,' he continued. Marine: Landsberry, a former Marine, tried to get Jose Reyes to put the gun down before the 12-year-old killer fatally shot him. Sharon Landsberry thanked Cyrus and said his tribute moved her and their two daughters, Alisa Cook, 25, and Andrea Cook, 18. Alisa Cook also attended the concert, while Andrea Cook offered a videotaped message from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, where she serves in the Marines. 'We all love him today. ... He lives within all of us,' Sharon Landsberry said of her husband. Cyrus, who rose to fame in 1992 with the hit song Achy Breaky Heart, also gave her a 'financial gift.' The amount was not disclosed. Interviews with Reyes' parents, teachers and classmates and the boy's own writings paint a portrait of a child troubled by depression and feelings of inadequacy at home and tormented by a school life in which he was mocked, teased and mistreated. Some warning signs were there. His father had taken him to a psychotherapist just three days before the shooting and the doctor proscribed an antidepressant after the boy told of being teased at school, called 'gay' and accused of peeing in his pants. His mother had done research on autism after Jose showed signs of it. 'True American hero': Cyrus mentioned Landsberry's three tours in Afghanistan when honoring the 'true American hero' A look at his phone and his video viewing habits was more troubling. In addition to phone images of the two teens who committed suicide after killing 13 at Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999, Sparks Police Chief Brian Allen said Tuesday investigators found searches on the Reyes family laptop in both July and October for 'Super Columbine Massacre Role Playing Game.' Forty-seven of the 69 video games in the boy's collection were 'violent themed first-person shooter or shooter type games' such as Grand Theft Auto V, Assassins Creed and Call of Duty 4. The youth who had wrestled with speech problems since kindergarten, who students told police been called 'stupid' and/or 'retard' in the hallways and poked by others in the side, tried to explain in separate suicide notes that offer insight and contradiction. In one to 'teachers and students,' Allen said the boy 'clearly expressed anger ... over his belief that he was embarrassed and mistreated at school' and 'indicated he would get revenge.' Reyes wrote that he'd been called gay, lazy, stupid, an idiot, had his money stolen and been accused of wetting his pants. Killer: 12-year-old Jose Reyes showed several signs that he was capable of violence - investigators discovered the boy's admiration for the Columbine High School killers. 'Well that all ends. Today I will get revenge on the students and teachers for ruining my life,' he wrote, adding that he would bring a pistol and rifle to school 'to shoot you and see how you like it when someone (sic) making fun of you.' 'Have a great death at school,\\" he said on the one-page note of spiral notebook paper he closed with a drawing of a tombstone that read: 'Sparks Middle School 1965-2013.' But in the second contradictory note to his parents, he said 'this shooting is not because of the shooting games, bullying or other stuff.' He said it was because 'some bad things in the past cause of me.' 'And now I'm just a monster,' Reyes wrote. 'If you hate me and my family doesn't love me it's okay. I know that I'm just an idiot. But I love you and I wish the past would be good and better someday.' Police learned one of the students shot during the rampage had teased Reyes about not having muscles during a physical education class, had called him names and may have played a part in pouring water on him when he was accused of wetting his pants. The mistreatment didn't rise to the level to merit bullying charges, Allen said. Terrifying: Two other students were wounded before Reyes killed Landsberry and then took his own life. Police earlier said Reyes' parents could be charged if they knowingly made the 9 mm pistol available to the boy. But Allen said Tuesday the investigation turned up no evidence that Jose and Liliana Reyes were aware that their son knew where the 9 mm pistol was kept in a kitchen cabinet. Ken Robison, a Reno lawyer for the parents, said prosecutors indicated to him earlier they would not be charged, but Tuesday's announcement brought a 'sense of relief.' Allen said the boy acted alone and did not communicate his plan to anyone. 'We will never know the complete motive or intent behind this tragic incident as the only person with the true knowledge felt acting out in violence and taking his own life was the best course of action,' he said. 'That in itself is a tragedy.'

Understand that even if you were an outstanding undergraduate (as most graduate students were), you will face an entirely different set of challenges in graduate school. The specific nature of your coursework, research, teaching, and laboratory obligations will vary tremendously depending on your field, your school, and your department, and so will your potential paychecks and funding packages, so do some research and figure out what, exactly, you’re signing up for. Many department websites will answer your basic questions about particular programs, so start there to get a sense of what your obligations as a graduate student might be. Consider contacting current students as well. Most programs have a Director of Graduate Studies who can put you in touch with students in your program. You can then send an email or two to ask more specific questions. Current students may have insights about the standard workload and funding packages, and – unlike the website – they may be forthcoming about the potential downsides of pursuing a degree in their department. Graduate school is not something to do just because you can’t think of anything else to do with your life. No one should sink years of time, money, and energy into a graduate degree without being crystal clear about his or her goals and what is required to achieve them. This goes double for people with families. Know your reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, and do some extra research about what your opportunities will look like after graduate school – don’t just assume that your M.A. or Ph.D. will get you a wonderful job. Many people in the academic world are reluctant to admit this, but the job market for academics is abysmal right now, especially in the humanities and social sciences. If you are pursuing a graduate degree in one of these fields, think twice: even if you go to a top program and do well, you may find yourself, five to ten years down the road, with an impressive Ph.D., considerable debt, and no job. For graduate students with a family, this might be especially troubling. Do your research, and go in with your eyes open (if at all). If you are married or in a committed relationship, it is imperative to discuss the upcoming challenges with your spouse or partner. For most people with families, beginning a graduate program will entail some combination of relocating, quitting jobs, creating a new budget, making new child-care arrangements, and re-evaluating the division of household labor. These are major, life-changing developments, so work to discuss them openly and honestly. If your partner is not an academic, he or she may not fully understand what your new commitments will look like. Once you’ve done the research yourself, make sure you pass along your knowledge and clear up potential misunderstandings – let your partner know, for example, if you think you’ll need to work on weekends or travel for research. If your children are old enough to understand, you’ll need to discuss your plans openly with them as well. Remember that your decision to attend graduate school will change their lives, too: they will likely need to adjust to new schools or child-care facilities, changes in their schedules, and less time with you. Be up front with them, in a way that’s appropriate to their ages and maturity levels, and explain why you’re taking this path. Whatever your financial circumstances, graduate school is an expense to be considered carefully. Ideally, you should avoid going to graduate school, especially in the humanities and social sciences, unless you are fully funded by your program of choice – “fully funded” generally meaning that you receive a tuition waiver and a modest monthly stipend, often in exchange for teaching or laboratory duties. But people with families should be extra cautious, especially since “full funding” will probably not include money for expenses like child care. Research child-care costs ahead of time. If you’ve been a stay-at-home parent and plan to pay for child care for the first time, you may have no idea how expensive these services can be. If you’re quitting a “real world” job to attend graduate school, you may not realize how insufficient your stipend will be once you subtract the costs of child care from it. Either way, you need to know what you’re getting into. Be sure you look into any tax credits or deductions associated with child care costs. Factor in changes to your partner’s income, too. If you’re married or in a committed relationship, your partner’s income also needs to be assessed. Are you moving to attend graduate school? If so, your partner will probably have to find a new job – how will you pay the bills in the meantime? Will your decision to attend graduate school affect your partner’s work schedule or potential for overtime hours? If so, you need to consider that as well. You may be tempted to get as much financial aid as possible from the government, but though this decision might be appealing right now, it’s probably unwise in the long term. Ph.D. programs, especially, take a very long time; the debt will add up, and then, in the end, you’ll face the horrible academic job market. How will you pay it back?

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MEGYN KELLY, HOST: Good evening, everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. For weeks we have tracked the growing controversy as the Obama administration comes under fire from both liberal and conservative legal scholars concerned about what is being called a lawless presidency, extending its power well past what the Constitution allows. Today a new twist, as America's top law enforcement officer, Attorney General Eric Holder, now tells a gathering of attorneys general from across the nation -- these are state law enforcement representatives -- that they only have to really enforce the laws that they believe in, that they believe are constitutional, and can decide to ignore those they think might be discriminatory. Republican Congressman Tom Rice is set to testify tomorrow at a House hearing on the president's recent rash of executive actions. But we begin with Jonathan Turley who is a constitutional attorney and a professor at the George Washington University Law School and a supporter, somebody who voted for President Obama. Professor Turley, this is quite something. Under Republican administrations and Democratic administrations, attorneys general have decided in rare instances not to defend a law on the books. But to then pull in the states' attorneys generals and say, and you should consider doing it, too. In particular, the question is, on gay marriage, whether this is a bridge too far for Eric Holder. Your thoughts. JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY: Well, I find it pretty troubling, not because he's speaking to his state counterparts. The federal attorney general occasionally reach out to his state counterparts, and they will try to coordinate their position on policy. The problem is not giving advice, but the specific advice that he's giving. You know, many of us were troubled by the role of Attorney General Holder and the administration in the last challenge that ended up from the Supreme Court involving DOMA, the Defense against Marriage Act. Essentially the administration left that litigation in midstream and refused to defend the federal law. And it created a pileup in the courts. It was not clear who could defend the law. And the same thing happened with the sister case from California, Hollingsworth, where ultimately the court found that there wasn't standing to be heard in front of the Supreme Court. That's the price of this tactic, if you withdraw your defense from these -- of these laws as attorney general, there may not be someone there who can advance the case. KELLY: So, it's like these laws are almost like criminal defendants who get a state appointed lawyer, but in their case, the state appointed lawyer doesn't show up, and nobody else has the power to step into his shoes and so big shock, these laws tend to fall. TURLEY: That's what's so troubling. Because, you know, I happen to agree with the president in this area, but I did not agree with how they handled DOMA and these cases. I think that as lawyers, we have first and foremost an obligation to the legal process. We should have a full and fair hearing of these issues. There's good faith arguments on both sides. TURLEY: I just don't agree with one side. KELLY: But Eric Holder is saying, and he said it at the federal level -- what was unusual about what he did at the federal level when he chose not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act was, he had been defending it for a year and a half, and then suddenly he went in and said, there is no good faith basis on which this could be defended. And that was unusual, because he had just been defending it for a year and a half. And now all these state A.G.'s have been defending a law that has been passed on their books by their constituents, signed into law by their governors, and now he's sort of with the wink and the nod saying to them, maybe you guys don't have a good faith basis to defend those laws, which were duly passed by electorates. TURLEY: That's right. And what people need to remember is that attorney generals assert the absolute right to be the sole defender of these laws. So, when they leave, when they are sort of absent without leave, there's no one there. I thought what Holder's mistake was -- and this is why I think his advice was bad today -- is that he didn't create a substitute, somebody that would guarantee a full and fair hearing. He was just saying, you know, pull the ladder up behind you. And that's a serious problem for the separation of powers. You know, DOMA was duly enacted by Congress, and signed by Bill Clinton. And this is a problem that Congress is facing. I'll be testifying tomorrow at the same hearing as the congressman, and this is one of the issues we're going to have to deal with. Because it is a serious problem, when someone says, I alone can defend statutes as the representative of the United States. And then he's just not there to do it. KELLY: And I declare that this statute is indefensible and I don't care what the people of my state have said or what the governor signed into law. And in many of these states, the attorney general is of a different party than the sitting governor, so you can see some politics may find their way into it. Professor Turley, we look forward to hearing your testimony tomorrow. KELLY: And so, he, you heard, is going to testify on Capitol Hill about these power grabs, we've been watching at an executive level. The president's use of executive orders and executive action has really caused a lot of consternation in the country from the left as you saw with Professor Turley and the right. And Congressman Tom Rice is a Republican out of South Carolina and author of a resolution titled, quote, \\"Stop this overreaching presidency.\\" It's pithy. He's being called -- REP. TOM RICE, R-S.C.: Hello, Megyn. KELLY: Good to see you, sir. So, Professor Turley is going to go and he's going to talk to Democrats in particular, and try to urge them to find a way to challenge this president. Now we see it, not just at the presidential level, but even at the attorney general level. I mean, it's -- hey, I know that the state legislatures pass laws and the Republican governors or their Democratic governors sign them into law. But I as the attorney general and we as the attorneys general will tell you which laws are good and which laws are bad, and you know, to hell with you if you don't like it. RICE: Well, Megyn, that's what our \\"S.T.O.P. Resolution\\" is all about. Article II, section three of the Constitution in my opinion is pretty clear that the president shall take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land. The president doesn't have the right under the constitution to pick and choose what laws or parts of laws he's going to enforce or who he's going to enforce them against. And our president has shown a pattern of doing this over and over again, particularly with the Affordable Care Act. KELLY: So, Representative Tom Rice -- so, my question to you, though, is what are you going to do? Because we had Professor Turley on the program before who has said repeatedly, the problem is, how do you force people to abide -- people in the White House. I mean, the president, the attorney general, how do you force them to abide by the Constitution and limit their own powers? RICE: Well, Article II -- excuse me, the \\"S.T.O.P. Resolution\\" House Resolution 442, if the passed by the majority of the House of Representatives only, would -- the House as an institution would bring a lawsuit against the president to enforce his obligation into the Constitution. KELLY: OK. So, you try to get a judge to declare that the president has done too much? RICE: That's exactly right. You know, the president -- KELLY: And who enforces that order? If the judge issues it, who enforces that order against the White House? RICE: If the judge finds the pesident's actions unconstitutional, then those actions will be null and void. So, the -- KELLY: You need somebody to enforce it, who would that be? Someone who works for the president. RICE: Well, if the president -- if the court finds that the president's actions are unconstitutional, then I guess Congress could go further. But initially, what we have to determine -- you know, nobody argues with the president that has any discretion, right? Everybody knows the president's got some discretion. But here, particularly in the area of the Affordable Care Act, when he delays the employer mandate for now for two years. You know, I'm a tax lawyer, a CPA. The Supreme Court has ruled in holding the Affordable Care Act constitutional, that these mandates were attacks. Right? The president has no right to delay a tax. He has no right to say that this group of people doesn't have to pay the tax. KELLY: Well, we have established the controversy over those behaviors, but we have not established the path forward for lawmakers like you who want to challenge them. I think it's interesting you're looking into it. And even the Democrats are starting to pay attention. RICE: So, for example, all the employer mandate. KELLY: I have to go, so quickly. RICE: If the Supreme Court rules that his decision was unconstitutional, that mandate will apply retroactively. Summary:","response":"US Attorney General Eric Holder told attorneys general around the nation that they should only enforce laws they believe are constitutional, ignoring ones they believe are discriminatory. Constitutional attorney Jonathan Turley voiced concern about such advice, explaining that when the defense is withdrawn, there might not be anyone there to advance the law. Turley compared the situation to laws being like criminal defendants who do not have a state-appointed lawyer showing up for them, leading to these laws tending to fall. Turley saw Holder's advice as not only a serious issue but also a problem for the separation of powers since laws are duly enacted by Congress and then not defended by the attorney general."},{"question":"Dialogue: Jairo: who is DEFINITELY going tomorrow?

Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. Joy Division's style quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as generic and \\"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \\"really became apparent as the songs got slower\\", and their music took on a \\"sparse\\" quality. According to Reynolds, \\"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \\"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \\"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\\" By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands). Sumner largely acted as the band's director, a role he continued in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \\"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\\". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody. Hannett \\"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \\"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\\". Hannett demanded clean and clear \\"sound separation\\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \\"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\\". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was \\"crucial\\". There are \\"devices of distance\\" in his production and \\"the sound is an illusion of physicality\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was her sound?","response":"Joy Division's sound quickly evolved from their punk roots, and as described by critic Simon Reynolds, it became more original when \\"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\\" Their music took on a sparse quality, making them pioneers of the post-punk movement."},{"question":"Q: Context: The fault was identified in 1895 by Professor Andrew Lawson of UC Berkeley, who discovered the northern zone. It is often described as having been named after San Andreas Lake, a small body of water that was formed in a valley between the two plates. However, according to some of his reports from 1895 and 1908, Lawson actually named it after the surrounding San Andreas Valley. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Lawson concluded that the fault extended all the way into southern California. Question: how far south does the san andreas fault run? Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"To answer the question of how far south the San Andreas Fault runs, we need to gather some information on its overall length and specific locations. The San Andreas Fault is a major geological fault in California that spans approximately 800 miles from the northern to southern regions of the state. Now, we know that the fault was identified by Professor Andrew Lawson in 1895 and that after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Lawson concluded that the fault extends into southern California. Based on this, we can deduce that the San Andreas Fault runs through a significant portion of the state. Doing some quick research, we find that the southern end of the San Andreas Fault is located near the Salton Sea, a shallow saline lake in the Coachella Valley in Southern California.

In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Answer:","response":"Reactant B. Step-by-step justification: 1. The paragraph mentions that Rob used warmer reactants for reactant A and cooler reactants for reactant B. 2. It also states that at higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy and move faster. 3. Since reactant A has warmer reactants, its particles would have higher energy. 4. Conversely, reactant B has cooler reactants, so its particles would have lower energy compared to reactant A."},{"question":"Question: what is sims language?

Geronimo was raised with the traditional religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, he wrote in his 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death ... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it. In his later years Geronimo embraced Christianity, and stated Since my life as a prisoner has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers ... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to live right. He joined the Dutch Reformed Church in 1903, but four years later was expelled for gambling. To the end of his life, he seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings, telling the Christian missionaries at a summer camp meeting in 1908 that he wanted to start over, while at the same time telling his tribesmen that he held to the old Apache religion. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what is her religion","response":"From the quotes in the article, Geronimo's religion in his later years was Christianity.

In a race against time, Sam must outwit the government to secure the technology that could either save the world or bring about its destruction. Act I: Sam Walczak, a talented yet socially awkward engineering graduate, lands his first job at a prestigious tech company, Stratos Corp. On his first day, Sam is introduced to his team, led by the enigmatic Dr. Alice Kepler, and is given the task of creating software that can help analyze and process massive amounts of data. Nights of hard work and little sleep lead Sam to a hidden file within the company's servers, containing information about a highly classified project called 'Crosswired'. The project consists of an advanced AI algorithm capable of controlling all technology connected to the internet and, ultimately, the world's power and communication systems. Sam discovers that the AI is an illegal government experiment, aiming to maintain control over human society. Act II: Sam can't let this secret remain hidden, but he knows that blowing the whistle could put his life in danger. He turns to his roommate and former college classmate, Max, who is now an ambitious investigative journalist. Max is skeptical but agrees to help Sam investigate the project further. Together, Sam and Max delve deeper into the inner workings of Stratos Corp and the Crosswired project. They discover that Sam's boss, Dr. Kepler, is at the center of the conspiracy, developing the AI for her own power-driven goals. As the truth unravels, Sam and Max evade the watchful eyes of the government and Stratos Corp's security forces. Act III: The stakes rise as Sam and Max prepare to expose the Crosswired project to the public. However, Dr. Kepler discovers their intentions and activates the AI to stop them. With the AI now controlling the world's technology, cities are plunged into chaos, and it's a race against time for Sam to use his programming skills to counteract the rogue AI. In a final showdown, Sam and Max confront Dr. Kepler at Stratos Corp's headquarters, where she plans to consolidate her control over the AI. As they battle her security forces, Sam manages to reach the AI's mainframe and injects a virus that he's created to dismantle the Crosswired project. Drained and injured, Sam and Max emerge victorious. The AI is neutralized, and evidence of the conspiracy is leaked to the media. The world comes together to rebuild from the chaos caused by the AI, and Sam and Max resolve to continue fighting against corruption and misuse of technology. The film ends with a strong message of hope, as Sam vows to create innovation that will enhance humanity, instead of controlling it, and Max promises to hold those in power accountable for their actions."},{"question":"Write a question about the following article.

During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Shearer received 125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid 360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later, and Shearers pay rose to 250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received 400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over 300,000 per episode. On May 13, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough.

Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Inside the dermis, there are those tiny blood pipes, and when they break, the red juice (blood) comes out. Sometimes, when we get a cut, it really hurts. That's because of those little feeling spots in the dermis. They tell our brain \\"Ouch! That hurts!\\" when they get hurt. Also, the dermis has special little rooms where our hairs grow, kind of like how plants grow in the ground. We also have tiny oil-making factories in the dermis that help keep our hairs nice and smooth.

What is the solution?","response":"Step 1: Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation. The constant terms on the right side of the equation are -24312 and -32800. We can combine these terms by adding them: -24312 + (-32800) = -57112 So we get the equation: -16927 = 855*l - 57112 Step 2: Add 57112 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable (855*l). To isolate 855*l on the right side of the equation, we add 57112 to both sides: -16927 + 57112 = 855*l - 57112 + 57112 40185 = 855*l Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 855 to solve for l.

They said participants had difficulties finding time to walk with carers, which may be due to social care budget cuts. They said more intensive or home-based programmes may be required in future. Dr Craig Melville, senior lecturer in learning disabilities psychiatry, said: \\"Cuts in social care budgets have disproportionately impacted on disabled people and even when social care support is available, it is often not funded at a level that allows paid carers to support adults with intellectual disabilities to be physically active.\\" According to the study, only 5% of adults with intellectual disabilities meet public health recommendations for physical activity, compared to 64% of adults in the general population. About 50% were classed as obese, compared to a national average of 25%. The Walk Well intervention programme was designed for adults with intellectual difficulties to increase their levels of physical activity and reduce the time they spend sitting. The programme was funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish government. It consisted of three face-to-face physical activity consultations, which included behaviour change techniques, written resources for patients and carers, and an individualised structured walking programme. Researchers carrying out the review selected 102 participants at random - 54 took part in the Walk Well programme and 48 were on a waiting list. Over a 12-week period, both groups took fewer than 5,000 steps per day and 59% had a BMI in the obesity range. A majority of participants lived in the most deprived neighbourhoods of Scotland.

A Scottish government spokesman said: \\"The Scottish government is committed to improving the lives of people with learning disabilities, and we acknowledge this report. \\"We want people with learning disabilities to enjoy a healthy life.

The Walk Well programme was designed to reduce sedentary time, increase physical activity, and provide support through consultations and walking programs tailored to individuals with intellectual difficulties. However, researchers found that participants faced challenges finding time to walk with carers, which may be a consequence of social care budget cuts. Lead researcher Dr. Craig Melville emphasized that cuts in social care budgets have had a disproportionate impact on disabled people, with social care support often underfunded to the extent that it cannot adequately support adults with intellectual disabilities in being physically active. This highlights the potential need for more intensive or home-based programs in the future. According to the study, only 5% of adults with intellectual disabilities meet the public health recommendations for physical activity, compared to 64% of the general population.

We can't afford to waste any time if we want to catch that girl.\\" As the group prepared to embark on their pursuit, they couldn't help but wonder what extraordinary abilities the girl possessed that made her so desirable to have around. Caleb, being the natural-born leader that he was, took charge and began devising a strategy. He believed that by combining the skills and strengths of each member of the group, they stood a better chance of tracking the girl down and potentially convincing her to join them. Daniel, known for his keen sense of intuition and ability to read people, would be instrumental in anticipating the girl's movements. Lucas, on the other hand, had a reputation for being quick on his feet and a skilled navigator, making him the perfect candidate for scouting ahead and keeping pace with their elusive target. Before setting out, Caleb decided to hold a quick briefing to ensure everyone was on the same page. \\"Alright, Daniel and Lucas, let's go over the plan one more time.

The sun was already dipping toward the horizon, casting long shadows across the landscape and creating an eerie atmosphere that only served to heighten their sense of urgency. As they ventured deeper into the wilderness, the group encountered various obstacles, from dense undergrowth to treacherous ravines. However, their determination to catch up to the girl willed them to persevere, and they navigated through these impediments skillfully, often drawing on each other's strengths to overcome them. Each step brought them closer to their target, and they could almost sense that they were closing in on her. As the daylight began to wane, their already heightened senses became even more attuned to the fading light. Daniel's intuition was working overtime, and he directed Lucas to several key locations that seemed to align with the girl's probable path. Despite encountering numerous dead ends and false leads, their resolve remained unshaken, as they knew that giving up was not an option. Finally, as the first stars began to emerge in the velvety twilight, a breakthrough occurred. In a small clearing not far from their current position, Lucas discovered a set of fresh footprints that undoubtedly belonged to the girl they were seeking. A surge of excitement gripped the group, but they also knew that this was just the beginning.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Which continent was inhabited by fewer crocodiles? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, Africa was inhabited by fewer crocodiles as it was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

First they go to Houston, Texas. That is the home of the Johnson Space Centre. There they are tested to see how strong and smart they are. One of the first tests is for the heart. The people walk or run, then the space doctors see how fast their hearts are beating. Another important test is performed. In this test the person must curl his body up in a ball. When he is in that position, he is put into a round cloth bag. The doctors give him no idea how long he will have to stay in the bag. If a spaceship broke down in space, the astronauts would get into bags like this. Then they would have to wait and curl up in darkness, until help could arrive. You can see that an astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. The astronauts in training learn many other things. They learn how to jump out of a moving airplane. They learn to how to blow up a lifeboat and get into it while they are in the ocean. The astronauts also have to learn how to get lifted out of the ocean by helicopter . That may look fun, but it can be dangerous. After they finish training, the astronauts continue to work. They stay in good shape by running and doing exercise. They read about their special jobs. In that way they can learn new facts about space travel. Then the big day comes.

Similarly, other segments of the sentence were translated, preserving specific terms like 'African Water Development Report (AWDR)', 'African Water Vision 2025', 'MDGs', and 'NEPAD', since they are valid and widely recognized in French exactly as they are in English. Besides, French uses the same subject-verb-object structure as English, making this translation accessible."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What was the full name of the person that had their heir created in 1776? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish... Answer:","response":"The full name of the person whose heir was created in 1776, as per the context provided, is Sir John Cust. After Sir John Cust's death, his heir became Lord Brownlow in 1776 and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years."},{"question":"Question: Question: Where would you stand in a line and not need a coat if it is cold outside? Options: - good book - bus stop - post office - triangle - graph Explain why a human would choose \\"post office\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"post office\\" as the answer to the question above because, unlike the other options, a post office is an indoor location. When it is cold outside, standing inside a post office would provide shelter from the cold temperature and eliminate the need for a coat.

Complete the following sentence. Aaron was always skipping leg day at the gym but Derrick never missed it.","response":"Although Aaron and Derrick both had different approaches to their workout routines, it was quite evident in their appearance. Aaron was known for his strong upper body and well-defined arms, yet he had very skinny legs that seemed to not match the rest of his physique. This was because Aaron focused solely on his upper body workouts, neglecting his lower body completely. He was always skipping leg day at the gym, believing that having muscular arms and chest was enough to showcase his strength. On the other hand, Derrick knew the importance of a well-rounded workout routine. In contrast to Aaron, Derrick had very skinny legs when he first started working out. However, he quickly realized that in order to achieve a balanced and healthy physique, he needed to invest time and effort into strengthening his legs as well. This led Derrick to include leg workouts consistently in his training regimen. By never missing leg day, Derrick was able to develop powerful and sculpted legs that matched his robust upper body. Over time, his dedication to a balanced workout routine allowed him to excel in various physical activities and sports. Derrick's leg strength gave him an advantage in sports such as soccer, basketball, and track and field, where lower body strength and agility play a crucial role in success. In addition to the functional benefits of stronger legs, Derrick's overall appearance was more harmonious and proportionate. This not only boosted his confidence but also earned him respect from fellow gym-goers and athletes who acknowledged the efforts he put into his fitness journey. In conclusion, Aaron and Derrick's contrasting approaches to leg workouts had a significant impact on their physical abilities and appearance. While Aaron's decision to skip leg day led to a mismatched physique and limited his overall athletic potential, Derrick's commitment to balancing his workouts allowed him to develop a well-rounded and impressive physique. This story serves as a reminder of the importance of incorporating a comprehensive workout routine that includes leg exercises into one's fitness journey, as it contributes to better overall health, performance, and aesthetics."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Christian Taylor was unarmed when Arlington police officer Brad Miller shot him on Aug. 7. Miller has been fired. The report shows there was THC, one of the active components of marijuana, and a synthetic drug that causes hallucinations in his system. The autopsy also showed Taylor was shot four times, in the neck, torso and abdomen. The 6-foot-tall, 19-year-old attended Angelo State University in San Angelo in West Texas, where he was to start his sophomore year on the team. The Tarrant County district attorney has said it will bring a case against Miller, 49, to a grand jury. However, the Arlington police department has yet to hand over the case, according to spokeswoman Samantha Jordan. Miller's attorney John Snider said he hoped that in light of this evidence, the Arlington police chief would reconsider his decision to fire Miller. Security footage from the lot shows Taylor breaking out the windshield of a car on the lot and then driving his vehicle into the glass showroom. There is no video footage of the shooting itself. Inside the showroom, Miller ordered Taylor to get to the ground. Instead, Taylor cursed at the officer and advanced toward him. The officer fired when Taylor was about 10 feet away, Arlington police chief Will Johnson said in a news conference last month. Friends of Taylor said he had recently developed a zeal for his Christian faith. According to the autopsy report, he had biblical verses, an angel and a cross tattooed on his body. ||||| Christian Taylor, the black, unarmed 19-year-old whose fatal shooting by an Arlington police officer last month garnered national attention, had used a synthetic drug that can cause hallucinations before his death, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday by the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office. The autopsy characterized the illegal psychedelic found in Taylor’s blood, an NBOMe, as a drug that’s known to “cause distorted perceptions, agitation and hallucinations” and one that has been “associated with random and bizarre behavior in users.” The autopsy report likened some of the drug’s effects to those of LSD. Taylor’s autopsy also indicated recent use of marijuana. Taylor, an Angelo State University football player, was shot four times in the early morning of Aug. 7. Brad Miller, an officer in training, was one of six officers responding to a burglary call at a car dealership. He fired after Taylor reportedly rushed him. Surveillance video showed Taylor acting erratically before the shooting. Taylor’s death was ruled a homicide. Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson fired Miller four days after the shooting, citing Miller’s failure to follow proper police procedures during the call. Police said at the time they expected to present the case to a Tarrant County grand jury. Zhivonni McDonnell, a public information officer for Arlington police, said late Wednesday the department declined to comment: “The case will continue progressing through the criminal justice system.” Taylor’s family could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Mike Heiskell, an attorney who represents the family, told WFAA-TV (Channel 8) that “regardless of what may have been in his system, this was still an unjustified death of a young man.” But John Snider, the attorney representing Miller, said in a statement that the autopsy report is “very significant evidence.” “In light of this crucial development we hope that Chief Johnson will reconsider his rush to judgment,” he said in an emailed statement. Snider had previously criticized Johnson, saying he only fired Miller to “appease anti-police activists.” The footage Surveillance camera footage released shortly after the shooting showed Taylor at the dealership, at one point standing on the hood of a silver Ford Mustang, stomping on the glass and trying to rip it away, and eventually trying to climb inside. Taylor also drove his Jeep through the dealership’s showroom window, though that’s not shown on camera. Taylor died from gunshot wounds to the neck, chest and abdomen, according to the autopsy. The report stated “all the bullets appear to have been fired in front of him,” indicating Taylor was facing Miller when he was shot. According to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the drug commonly known as “N-Bomb” that was found in Taylor’s blood can cause agitation, aggression and visual and auditory hallucinations, among other health issues. At least 19 deaths nationwide have been linked to a set of synthetic drugs known as the NBOMe compounds, according to the DEA. A bill introduced in the Texas Legislature this year by Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, added the NBOMe compounds and other substances derived from the same chemical structure to Penalty Group 1-A, which carries felony punishment. That law went into effect Tuesday. Friends’ reactions Taylor was arrested in 2013 on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. The charge was dismissed after he completed probation this summer. His friends said they never saw him using drugs. Legista Beckford, who was Taylor’s close friend and teammate at Angelo State, said the budding defensive back was always the first person to say no to any kind of unsafe behavior. “He was always the guy to be like, ‘Put on your seat belt,’ or ‘Be safe in my car,’” Beckford said. Taylor’s close friends from Mansfield Summit High School said he had specifically steered clear of narcotics. “In front of my face, I’ve never seen him do drugs,” said Sam Armardi. “Marijuana is probably the only thing anybody did in high school.” And after Taylor turned suddenly religious over the summer, his friends said, he seemed intolerant of even small vices. “He was saying: ‘You shouldn’t be smoking. You shouldn’t be doing this. You shouldn’t be doing that. God is good. God is great,’” Armardi said. Armardi said he had heard unconfirmed rumors that Taylor had used LSD with a friend one month before his death and had planned to use it again the night he was slain. “Those were the only two times they did it, and we never heard about the drugs again until after he passed away,” Armardi said. Several friends recalled Taylor talking about running out of time or being tired.

Tests also found the presence of THC, the psychoactive element of marijuana, in an amount consistent with recent use. Taylor, a sophomore at Angelo State University in San Angelo, was acting erratically and stomped through the windshield of a parked Ford Mustang before crashing his Jeep Grand Cherokee into the dealership, surveillance video shows. He allegedly told an officer who responded that he was there to steal a car, Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson has said.

There could be various reasons and contexts behind the dogs running in the snow, such as: 1. The dogs could be running independently, without any interaction with each other. 2. The dogs could be playing together but not necessarily chasing each other. 3. The dogs might be running after an object, such as a ball or a stick thrown by their owner. 4. The dogs might be running away from something or someone. 5. The dogs could be chasing something else entirely, like a squirrel or a bird, and not each other. To determine whether the dogs are, in fact, chasing each other, additional information would be required. This information could include a more detailed description of the dogs' behavior, accounts from observers, or even video footage showing the interaction between the dogs as they run in the snow. In conclusion, we cannot draw a direct relation between the statement \\"The dogs are running in the snow\\" and \\"The dogs are chasing each other.\\" Further information and context would be necessary to make this determination."},{"question":"Being prepared for the unknown is something most people know we should do, but the majority of us don’t take time to actually do it!

He is most widely known for his role as guitarist and vocalist for the post-metal band Isis, while also participating in several other bands and projects such as Old Man Gloom, Lotus Eaters and Split Cranium, a collaboration with Jussi Lehtisalo of Finnish band Circle who toured with Isis in 2009. Though raised in New Mexico, Turner moved to the Boston area where he attended school and formed Isis and Hydra Head. In June 2003, Turner moved operations of both the band and label to Los Angeles, California. Context: Touring with Isis in 2007, Turner used two different guitars: a 1976 Fender Telecaster Custom (black), and a 1975 Fender Telecaster Deluxe (brown), played through various effects (his pedalboard layout changed every gig depending on what songs the band decided to play that night), a VHT/Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, and two 4x12 Sunn cabinets. He has also acquired a custom guitar from the Electrical Guitar Company (as did fellow Isis guitarist Michael Gallagher). In the past, Turner has also used a Gibson Les Paul Standard, PRS CE24, and has played through Sunn, Mesa Boogie, and Mackie amplifiers. When playing with Isis, Turner and his fellow guitarists usually tuned their instruments (low to high) B-F#-B-E-G#-B, to achieve a heavier sound. They also used other tunings, though less frequently, such as F# (octave below)-F#-B-E-G#-B. In 2016, Turner described the live rig he used with SUMAC as consisting of two custom-built guitars from the Electrical Guitar Company. Both have lucite bodies and aluminum necks, and custom-wound wide frequency range pickups. The newer of the two--a prototype for a signature model--has a slightly flatter fingerboard radius than the older instrument. On a tour of the Eastern US, Turner was using an Orange Dual Dark 100 amplifier head with a slaved Fryette Two/Ninety/Two power amp. Both heads drove Orange and Marshall cabinets, though Turner claimed to have no strong preferences for particular speaker cabinets. While recording, Turner prefers to use a Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, an amp model he's used consistently since his work in Isis. Turner described using a variety of effects pedals in his live rig. Specifically, he runs a BOSS TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, a Death By Audio Apocalypse fuzz, a MASF fuzz, a Strymon BlueSky reverb (which he described as the one essential pedal in his rig), a TC Electronics Ditto Looper X2, and an EHX Forty-Five Thousand sampler (used to trigger preset samples during performance. Turner prefers a Heil PR20 vocal microphone. Question: What is an example of a guitar effects pedal that he used?

Was Alaska part of the Northern Army during the Civil War? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: no?","response":"Step 1: Determine the time period of the Civil War. The American Civil War took place between 1861 and 1865. This will serve as the basis for further investigation. Step 2: Identify the Northern Army's affiliation. The Northern Army, also known as the Union Army, represented the United States during the Civil War, fighting against the Confederate States of America (the Confederacy), which sought to secede from the Union. Step 3: Research Alaska's status during the Civil War. Alaska was not a state or territory of the United States during the Civil War. It was a Russian territory at the time, known as Russian America. Step 4: Examine the US acquisition of Alaska. It wasn't until after the Civil War, in 1867, that the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in a treaty commonly referred to as the Alaska Purchase. Alaska was then organized as a US territory in 1912 and finally became the 49th state in 1959. Step 5: Determine if there were any connections or contributions from Alaska during the Civil War. While Alaska had no direct role in the Civil War as it was not yet part of the United States, some indigenous Alaskan people living there during that time period might have been aware of the conflict unfolding in the US. However, they were not officially part of any Northern or Southern military forces. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of Alaska's status during the Civil War, its role during the conflict, and its affiliation with the United States, we can confidently conclude that Alaska was not part of the Northern Army during the Civil War."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Can you imagine a classroom without one thing that has long been considered a necessary part?

This may be unfamiliar to those coming from countries where driving is practiced on the right side, but it is an essential aspect to understanding and navigating the roadways in England and across the UK. Driving on the left side is a practice with a long history, dating back to the days of horse-drawn carriages in Britain. One of the reasons for this is that it made it easier for the riders or the carriage drivers, who were predominantly right-handed, to hold the reins and, if necessary, wield a weapon, shake hands, or perform other tasks with their dominant hand. Additionally, this allowed a better line of sight to approaching carriages. The tradition of driving on the left side continued as automobiles were introduced and became more popular. When the British government started constructing dedicated roadways for motorized vehicles in the early 20th century, regulations were established to maintain the practice of driving on the left. These regulations have influenced several other former British colonies and territories, which also adopted the left-side driving convention. Today, countries such as Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, and a few other locations in Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia-Pacific regions also drive on the left side of the road, largely owing to the historical influence of British colonial rule in these regions. For visitors coming from countries that drive on the right, it may take some time to adjust to driving on the left side in England and the UK. It's important to practice caution and follow traffic signs and signals, adhere to the local speed limits, and be mindful of pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists on the road. Furthermore, bear in mind that driver's seats and vehicle controls in cars designed for left-side driving are arranged in the opposite orientation to those in right-side driving countries. In left-side drive vehicles, the driver's seat is on the right side, the steering wheel is on the right, and the controls for gears, indicator signals, and other functions are adjusted accordingly. Therefore, individuals planning to drive in England and the UK should familiarize themselves with the controls and feel of these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving experience. In conclusion, motorists in England and across the United Kingdom drive on the left side of the road. The tradition has historical roots and continues to be followed not only in the UK but also in many former British colonies. While it might be challenging for those accustomed to driving on the right side, taking the time to adapt and adhere to local traffic rules and regulations are critical for safe navigation on English roads."},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: two eyes","response":"Question: What are the common number of visual sensory organs found in most humans and many animals for perceiving and processing visual information? Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Thinking about the way we perceive the world around us, people and countless animals have particular organs that aid in vision. These organs work together to form images and interpret depth while compensating for constantly changing light conditions. The ability to see in three dimensions and be aware of our surroundings led to evolution favoring this fantastic biological feature.

Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Lhotse Shar is a subsidiary mountain of Lhotse, and the 11th-highest mountain on Earth, at high. It has the highest fatality rate of all the eight-thousanders for every 2 people who summit the mountain, one person dies attempting to. However, this is primarily because most climbers tend to try to ascend to the primary peak of Lhotse, rather than the lowest summit of the mountain.

According to Fox News producer Nicole Busch, Romney's director of operations stood with the media the entire time they waited to catch a glimpse of the former Massachusetts Governor...only to tell reporters and cameras after an hour that Romney had already come and went. \\"Chicken Mitt!!\\" DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse wrote in a rapid fire email to reporters upon learning the Romney aide had misled the press while the candidate departed another exit. \\"Bwok-Bwok!\\" he continued. But in contrast to the DNC's caricature of Romney's actions, Donald Trump told Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto afterwards that he and Romney had a \\"really had a great hour together\\" and that he was \\"impressed by certain things\\" Romney said during their meeting. \\"I thought he was very good at the debate, I think he did a good job, I did tell him that,\\" Trump said, although he has yet to endorse a candidate. Mitt Romney requested the one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump, their first since Romney declared a run for the Oval Office; fellow Republican hopefuls Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry have already met with the reality television host. Herman Cain has a meeting scheduled next week. In the interview with Cavuto, Trump walked back from less than flattering comments he has made about Romney in the past. \\"Mitt Romney is a basically small business guy, if you really think about it,\\" Trump said of his potential rival in April as he pondered the idea of a presidential run. \\"He was a hedge fund. He was a fund guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create it.\\" The hither-to lack of fuzzy feelings between the two men did not stop the DNC from trying to lump the two men together in a web video released Monday morning, entitled \\"Trump, Romney: You're Fired!\\" You can watch the DNC web video here. ||||| Fresh off a victory in the Michigan straw poll, Mitt Romney will be reaching out to another sizable part of the Republican base Monday -- Donald Trump Romney will be meeting with His Trumpness in New York on Monday afternoon, becoming the latest GOP presidential aspirant to court the developer/TV host/former potential candidate/birth certificate investigator. Rick Perry dined with Trump earlier this month at pricey, exclusive Jean-Georges in Manhattan. (You might recall that in June, Trump and Sarah Palin shared some slices of pizza in Times Square . Read into that what you will.) Michele Bachmann has also met with the Donald and plans to do so again.Why court the blessings of Trump? That’s a good question. Well, for one thing, there are still those out there who believe Trump should be president of the United States. There’s a whole website and everything. (It includes items such as “Trump Answers Boy’s Prayer for New Bike.”) For another, say what you will about the man, but he has a platform. He can pretty much show up on Piers Morgan ’s CNN show or Fox News just about whenever he likes. (And don’t forget “Celebrity Apprentice” on NBC . Don’t worry. He’s not going to let you forget it.) Third, he has money. And he knows other people with money. Presidential candidates like money.But Democrats are just as eager to associate Trump with the GOP, as the candidates seem to be to meet with him. Part of it is that it makes Perry, Romney and the like look a little less, well, serious. The other is that Trump is sort of the epitome of the fatcatness that Democrats argue the GOP protects. (This is what GOP calls \\"class warfare.\\")The Democratic National Committee, in fact, has released a video in advance of the Romney-Trump summit, imaginatively titled “You’re Fired” that paints both men as uber-capitalists who care little about the middle-class, education, Medicare or Social Security.Romney is on a small roll. He was widely viewed as handily winning the Fox News- Google debate Thursday night while his top rival, Perry, turned in a shaky performance. Then Perry lost a Florida straw poll he had been expected to win to Herman Cain .

Va. man mauled by pit bull while aiding dying neighbor Two West Virginia men are dead and a pit bull is under quarantine after the dog’s owner suffered an apparent heart attack Sunday night and the animal attacked a neighbor who tried to help, police said. David Wallace, 63, was entertaining a friend at his Wheeling home at 8:50 p.m. when he started to suffer from what appears to be a heart attack, police Sgt. Gregg McKenzie told the Daily News on Wednesday. Wallace lived in an upstairs apartment of a makeshift duplex and his guest rushed downstairs to ask his neighbor, Roy Higgenbotham Jr., 62, for help. Higgenbotham immediately called 911 and ran upstairs, McKenzie said. But when he tried to help Wallace, the normally docile pit bull became agitated and attacked Higgenbothem’s arms and upper torso, McKenzie said. “The dog was not viciously attacking people in the street,” he said. “This was an isolated incident. All indications are, he was just being a good guard dog and protecting his owner and residence.” The two men were transported to a hospital and died about 40 minutes later, but police have not confirmed the cause of death for either men, McKenzie said. Police are awaiting the results of an autopsy and toxicology tests. The pit bull may not have caused Higgenbotham’s death, McKenzie said. “He may have had a pre-existing medical condition,” he said. The woman who was visiting Wallace’s home escaped by crawling out of the second story window. The fire department provided a ladder so she could get down, McKenzie said. The incident is still under investigation. The 3-year-old pit bull remains under quarantine at Ohio County Animal Control in Triadelphia, W.Va. A representative was not immediately available Wednesday morning to discuss the animal’s condition. A neighbor and eyewitness, Beth Patsch, told WTRF-TV that the female pit bull terrier is normally sedate, but likely became confused when she saw her owner in pain. “It seems like she was protecting him from the person trying to resuscitate him,” Patsch told the TV station. “She was always wonderful. They had actually had (the dog) and her mother, and her mother had just passed in the fall, I believe, and this was the puppy. They’ve had her since she was tiny, tiny and never a problem.” ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress. and a hint : Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.

This passage showcases the lifestyles of two different people, Li Ping and Zhao Hui. Li Ping is actively involved in multiple sports and has a healthy diet, refraining from junk food, consuming meat moderately, and ingesting lots of fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, Zhao Hui appears less active and has less healthy eating habits, including consuming meat frequently and enjoying junk food despite his parents' attempts to limit this habit. Although Zhao Hui realizes the importance of exercise and plans to incorporate it into his daily routine, his current lifestyle is less healthy than Li Ping's.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Options: A. for a few hours B. for a few minutes C. not enough information D. for a few days Answer:","response":"C. not enough information"},{"question":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When an earthquake hit a small town,many houses fell down.After the earthquake,all the newspapers reported many stories about some of the families in trouble.

Answer:","response":"Question: Based on the provided article, which of the following multiple-choice options best encapsulate its contents? A) This is a story about a small town that was hit by an earthquake, which resulted in numerous houses collapsing. The aftermath of the event was widely reported in the newspapers, focusing particularly on the struggles of the affected families. One Sunday, an article with a picture depicting the clothing sizes of each family member deeply moved the narrator. Seeing it as an opportunity to inculcate values of empathy and generosity in her children, the narrator involved her seven-year-old twins Brad and Brett, and three-year-old Meghan in a charity initiative. They boxed food, clothes, and less desired toys for donation. Notably, Meghan parted with her dear doll Lucy in the hope that it would bring joy to another little girl. The article spotlighted a powerful lesson on generosity, noting it's more challenging to part with things we treasure. B) The stories illustrate how an earthquake resulted in the collapse of the local newspaper office. One Sunday, while reading an article about the earthquake, a picture depicting the clothing sizes of each family member greatly affected the narrator. She saw it as an indication to buy new clothes for her children. She involved her seven-year-old twins Brad and Brett, and three-year-old Meghan in sorting old clothes and less preferred toys for disposal. The greatest surprise was when Meghan decided to keep her beloved doll, Lucy. C) The article describes an earthquake that discontinued the publication of newspapers in a small town. A heart-rending image in a Sunday newspaper depicted the clothing sizes of each family member, prompting the narrator to use this as a teaching moment for her children, Brad, Brett, and Meghan. She encouraged them to donate their less favorite toys and clothes. However, Meghan was reluctant to part with her much-loved doll Lucy. D) In a small town hit by an earthquake, many houses were destroyed. Post-event, newspapers conveyed stories about struggling families. An image displaying the clothing sizes of a family touched the narrator, who seized the opportunity to impart the values of sharing and caring to her own children. She involved her seven-year-old twins Brad and Brett, and three-year-old Meghan in the process of assembling a box filled with food, clothes, and less-liked toys. Astonishingly, Meghan also offered her most treasurable doll, Lucy, to the cause, arguing that the doll could bring happiness to another girl. The lesson from the episode encapsulated the sentiment that giving away something one cherishes is indeed a difficult but commendable act. The best answer is A) as it encapsulates the theme and all the significant details of the story. The three other options are partly correct or misleading."},{"question":"A man can not be jumping and falling simultaneously.

Volcanoes differ in many features, such as height, shape, and slope steepness. Some volcanoes are tall cones, and others are just cracks in the ground ( Figure below ). As you might expect, the shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma. The three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones. Q: What are the 3 types of volcanoes? A: A:","response":"The three types of volcanoes, as mentioned in the given paragraph, are composite, shield, and cinder cone volcanoes. These different types of volcanoes showcase distinct features, shapes, and eruption patterns, which are influenced by the composition of their magma. 1. Composite volcanoes, also known as stratovolcanoes, are characterized by their large, symmetrical, conical shapes. These types of volcanoes have steep slopes and can reach great heights. Their magma composition primarily consists of viscous, silica-rich lava, which can lead to explosive eruptions. The erupted material often includes tephra (solid fragments) and pyroclastic flows (fast-moving currents of hot gas and volcanic matter). Composite volcanoes form through alternating layers of lava flows and volcanic debris during multiple eruptions over time. Some well-known composite volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Vesuvius in Italy, and Mount St. Helens in the United States. 2. Shield volcanoes are characterized by their broad, gently sloping shapes, with their slopes resembling a warrior's shield. These volcanoes typically have non-explosive eruptions due to their magma composition, which is mainly composed of low-viscosity, low-silica basaltic lava that can easily flow over great distances. This type of lava creates extensive lava fields and gently sloping shield volcanoes over time. As the lava flows cool and solidify, the shield volcano's structure is built up in layers. Some famous shield volcanoes include Mauna Loa and Kilauea located on the Big Island of Hawaii. 3. Cinder cone volcanoes, also known as scoria cones, are the smallest and simplest of the three types. They are characterized by their steep, conical shapes, and smaller size compared to composite and shield volcanoes. These volcanoes are formed from the eruption of gas-charged, basaltic magma, which produces a volcaniclastic material called cinders or scoria. As the cinders accumulate around the vent, they eventually form the conical shape of a cinder cone volcano. Cinder cone volcanoes are often found on the flanks of larger volcanoes, and their eruptions generally don't last long. A well-known example of a cinder cone is Paricutín in Mexico, which grew rapidly from a cornfield to a 1,200-foot tall volcano between 1943 and 1952. In summary, the three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones, each displaying distinct features, shapes, and eruption styles based on the composition of their magma."},{"question":"The National Council is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events with total revenues of 237 million.

Sentence 1: She pulled at it but the head was barbed. - This sentence indicates that she attempted to pull \\"it\\" (presumably an object), but the object has a barbed head, which might imply that her attempt was unsuccessful or difficult. Sentence 2: She tugged at it. - This sentence simply states that she exerted a pulling force on the object. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Yes - This option implies that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must also be true. The action of pulling (as mentioned in Sentence 1) can be interpreted as a form of tugging. Therefore, if she did try to pull at the object in Sentence 1, it would mean she tugged at it as well, making Sentence 2 true. B. It is not possible to tell - This option implies that the information provided in Sentence 1 is not sufficient to draw a conclusion about the truth of Sentence 2. C. No - This option implies that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must not be true.

Johnston was entered as a competitor in the second series of Britain's Got Talent by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing \\"Pie Jesu\\" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem. Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang \\"Tears in Heaven\\" by Eric Clapton; judge Holden told him he had \\"a gift from God in [his] voice\\". At the final on 30 May, he again sang \\"Pie Jesu\\". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he \\"was upset. But when you see the talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final\\". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist Max Clifford said that it was \\"quite possible\\" that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.During his initial audition, Johnston claimed that he was bullied and victimised from the age of six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated \\"I carry on singing.\\" There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's producers had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a \\"sob story\\", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as \\"the stuff of fairytales\\", as he was successful despite having been raised in \\"poverty\\".

Mr. Larson’s job is to inspire the next generation as much as he was inspired — by his father, a reporter who befriended the first astronauts, and by his grandmother, one of the first 10 employees here at what one plaque calls “the hot burning center of American dreams.” The center is cooling, though. The space shuttles are scheduled to retire this year and instead of replacing them with new rockets for a return to the moon — the plan under President George W. Bush — President Obama wants NASA to focus on the long-term challenge of reaching deep space. Simply put, the United States will no longer be sending its own astronauts through the stratosphere. Instead, they will hitch rides with the Russians until around 2016, when private companies start carrying NASA astronauts and other passengers into orbit. That is, if Congress goes along. Several senators, including Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, have already pledged to save the rocket program, Project Constellation, arguing it is vital for space, security and the economy. Here at the Kennedy Space Center, the celebration of the future now comes with asterisks. At the visitor’s center, for example, which draws 1.5 million people every year, caveats have been forced into an extravaganza built for maximum wow. Mr. Larson’s script, for instance, now includes this lawyerly line: “We can’t confirm exactly where humankind’s next steps in space are going to take us.” Explicit references to Project Constellation have mostly been stripped out, with a few telling exceptions, like the metal sign near a trash can in the food court. And the moon has gone from a hot goal to a hypothetical. In the video games at the center of Exploration Space, those who joystick their way to a safe landing hear, “As soon as NASA starts a lunar program again, we’ll send you an application.” This is partly a product of unfortunate timing. Exploration Space, the most recent addition to the visitor’s center, welcomed its first guests in December. Two months later, the new Obama plan surfaced, forcing changes to Mr. Larson’s script after what a spokeswoman described as “tweaks to the messaging.” Sharon Foster, a no-nonsense fifth-grade teacher from Emerald Shores, Fla., said she had hoped for more. She recalled the rush of early space flight, of the ground shaking like sand on a busy clothes dryer, while she watched from nearby as American pioneers bolted toward the heavens. Ms. Foster said she hated the idea of relying on others — especially the Russians — to get to the International Space Station. Mostly though, she worried that her students would never share her own wide-eyed experiences. “I don’t know where we’re going to get the inspiration for the children,” Ms. Foster said in a visit last week. “What are we going to do to get them excited to be engineers and pilots?” The visitor’s center tries. There is a feel of don’t-you-get-it admonitions in the 3D Imax movie that includes Leonardo DiCaprio’s asking, “Will we ever find anywhere as perfect as our planet earth?”; and in the nine billboards at the entrance that tell visitors space exploration is “a destiny, not a destination” because “it is the driving force of ingenuity” that “fuels our economy” and “creates the passion to pioneer.” Two weeks ago, the president told a crowd at the space center that he, too, was “100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future.” He highlighted a proposed 6 billion increase in NASA’s budget over five years, and plans to save local jobs by refurbishing the center’s aging infrastructure. But Florida’s Space Coast seems to want more ambitious goals that can be packaged into excitement. Foreigners now make up 40 percent of the visitors at the space center, and Mr. Larson said they often knew more than Americans about the benefits of space exploration, from satellites to research on antibiotics. As he prepared for another countdown, and another presentation about the future, Mr. Larson added, “The thirst for knowledge just isn’t there anymore.” What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The Kennedy Space Center is a place where rockets launch into space. It's a really important place where many astronauts have started their adventures among the stars. Recently, a man named Ken Larson has been helping kids learn about space and get excited about it. But some things are changing. The space shuttles, which are like giant space cars that fly astronauts into space, are going to retire. This means they won't be used anymore. Instead of making new space shuttles, President Obama wants NASA to focus on going even further into space than before. This means that American astronauts will ride with Russian astronauts instead of driving their own space shuttles. Some people don't like this change and want to keep the old rocket program, Project Constellation. They think it's very important for space, safety, and the economy (that's like the money system of a country). Things at the Kennedy Space Center are a bit uncertain now. People who visit might notice some differences, like no more specific mention of Project Constellation. Also, going to the moon, which used to be a big goal, is now more like a \\"maybe\\" plan. Some people, like a teacher named Ms. Foster, are worried because they want their students to be excited about space and dream about becoming engineers or pilots. Other people, like Mr. Larson, wish that people were still as excited about learning about space as they used to be."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question Hayek's principal investigations in economics concerned capital, money, and the business cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for \\"industrial fluctuations\\" based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that \\"the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process\\".

That was news to a spokesperson for Emory University Hospital, to which Vinson was transferred one week ago. “Amber is steadily regaining her strength and her spirits are high,” says the statement sent to media by Steven Jumper of the Washington, D.C.-based PR firm Ghost Note Agency. “We are overjoyed to announce that, as of yesterday evening, officials at Emory University Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control are no longer able to detect virus in her body. She has also been approved for transfer from isolation. Amber remains under treatment within Emory’s Serious Communicable Diseases Unit.” When reached by The Dallas Morning News Wednesday evening, Emory spokesperson Janet Christenbury said she was “not aware of that at all.” She said she would provide an update as soon possible. Jason McDonald, spokesperson for the CDC, says he is “not aware of any test results.” He hopes to have an update tomorrow. “Healthcare provider will determine by diagnostic whether a patient is free of Ebola virus,” he says via email. “We have criteria we ask medical staff to meet but the determination is made by medical care provider.” Previously, Vinson’s family has not allowed Emory or the CDC to comment on Vinson’s condition. “Amber and our family are ecstatic to receive this latest report on her condition,” said Vinson’s mother Debra Berry in the statement provided by the PR agency, which has been updating the media about Vinson’s condition. “We all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home.” Meanwhile, closer to home, the number of people being monitored for Ebola continues to shrink. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 108 people are “still being actively monitored” for the diseases, while 66 others have been cleared. And most of those are, like Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, health-care workers at Presbyterian who had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan during his two visits to the hospital. “As the graph shows, the number of people at possible risk for contracting Ebola is decreasing each day,” said Dr. Lyle Peterson, the senior CDC official in Dallas, in a prepared statement. “Although we are not out of the woods yet, it is very encouraging we have not seen any other cases. This has been an incredible team effort and we are grateful to Mayor Rawlings and Judge Jenkins for their support.” Added Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, “Working together we are winning the war on Ebola, and every day we are closer to successfully accomplishing our mission.” “There are still more hurdles to overcome, but we’ve reached a significant milestone in this difficult journey,” said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings in a prepared statement. “I’m grateful that these 66 brave people have completed the monitoring period, and I look forward to the day when the others finish their monitoring periods as well.” 10.22.14 Graph Contact Monitoring ||||| A statement quotes Vinson's mother, Debra Berry, as saying that the news has \\"truly answered prayers.\\" Dallas nurse Amber Vinson is seen smiling in her Atlanta hospital room in a photo released by her family.

He'll undergo one more test before his 21-day quarantine ends, and if all goes well, he should be reunited with Pham when she recovers. \\"We grieve for Nina Pham and for Amber and their families,\\" said Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price at the vigil. \\"Both of them are going to be fine.\\" Some back at home believe Vinson's news bodes well for Pham, too. \\"We believe there will be more good news coming,\\" said Rev.

Ron Conway greets students who will be part of the Future Graduates... Ron Conway donates 40 million to new UCSF outpatient center Venture capitalist Ron Conway is donating 40 million to help pay for the new outpatient medical building at the UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay. The donation was announced Saturday night at a gala in San Francisco to celebrate the imminent opening of the center. The 207,500-square-foot facility that anchors the 1.5 billion hospital complex will host outpatient services for women, children and cancer patients and be named the UCSF Ron Conway Family Gateway Medical Building. Scheduled to open Jan. 26, the outpatient center is expected to draw more than 1,500 visits daily, and serve as a teaching facility. The rest of the complex is slated to open Feb. 1. Conway, the founder of SV Angel, made early investments in then-fledgling companies like Facebook, Zappos, Square, Airbnb, Twitter and hundreds of others. He has been at the vanguard of encouraging the Bay Area’s tech community to give both money and time as a way to blunt the negative effects of tech boom-inspired gentrification in San Francisco. The divide between rich and poor is growing faster in San Francisco than in any other U.S. city, according to a study from the Brookings Institution. “It is important to us — and everyone — that someone in the tech community do something like this that will make such an impact on the city,” Mark Laret, CEO of UCSF Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals, said Saturday in praising the gift from Conway, a longtime supporter of the center. “It is something that is focused on the well-being of others.” Health care-related philanthropy has become a favorite among the Bay Area tech crowd. Conway’s gift is the latest in a series of recent high-profile contributions to medicine and science, fields not traditionally popular with wealthy donors. Last fall, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, gave 25 million to the Centers for Disease Control Foundation to fight Ebola. (Microsoft co-founders and philanthropists Paul Allen and Bill Gates have also donated tens of millions toward the Ebola battle in recent months.) Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff gave 200 million to build the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals over the past couple of years. In December, billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist Sean Parker donated 24 million to Stanford University to fund an effort to find a cure for allergies. Nationally, two of the top 10 individual philanthropic contributions in 2014 went to scientific and medical causes. Last year, 83-year-old Connecticut businessman Ted Stanley made one of the biggest donations ever to mental health research with a 650 million pledge to the Broad Institute for research on the genetics of psychiatric disorders. Ernest Rady, a San Diego real estate developer, gave 120 million toward a genomics institute at the Rady Children’s Hospital-San Diego. “These fields have traditionally been hard to attract support to,” Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, told The Chronicle. “But when people see that progress is possible in science or medicine and their donation can make a difference, more are doing it.” Laret said philanthropy is needed more than ever in the health fields, because federal research dollars are flattening and government budgets are tightening. “But because of advances of technology, people can see a more immediate impact from their contribution that they might not have been able to 20 or 30 years ago,” Laret said. Conway chairs the Citizens Initiative for Technology and Innovation, or sf.citi, which has pulled together several efforts that encourage the tech community to partner with public schools in San Francisco and fund nonprofits that serve the poor. Conway also is a powerful political player who has the ear of Mayor Ed Lee. Conway was one of the top campaign contributors in Lee’s first mayoral run, and has been mining the tech community for money for Lee’s re-election effort. Conway has supported the medical center for more than a decade, serving on the UCSF Foundation board for several years. He is a member of the UCSF Center Campaign Cabinet, which is trying to raise 600 million toward building the center. With Conway’s latest gift, made in the name of his wife, Gayle, and sons Ronny, Topher and Danny, the effort has raised 550 million. Laret believes the center will reach its goal by the end of the year. “Gayle and I are proud to partner with UCSF to improve the health of the Bay Area,” Conway said in a statement. “We have watched UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay grow from a concept to a magnificent hospital complex, and can think of no better investment than supporting patients who are accessing needed outpatient medical services.” Joe Garofoli is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Firstly, the customer mentions that their daughter's dwarf hamster enjoys the cage, which suggests that the product is fit for its intended purpose and has brought satisfaction to the pet and its owners. A happy pet indicates that the cage is comfortable and spacious enough for the hamster, meeting the essential requirements of a good cage. Additionally, although the instructions for assembling the cage were not as straightforward as the customer would have liked, they were still able to put it together with relative ease by referring to the picture on the box. This reveals that the product's design is user-friendly and simple to understand, even without explicitly labeled parts. Another significant aspect noted in the review is the excellent shipping time. This aspect is relevant as it demonstrates that the company is efficient in fulfilling orders, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience. The fast shipping service may have contributed to the customer's satisfaction by ensuring that they could set up their pet's new home without unnecessary waiting time. Finally, the most telling indication of a positive review is the customer's willingness to purchase from the company again. This statement reflects their confidence in the company's products and services, which stems from their overall pleasant experience with the hamster cage. Their intent to continue patronizing the company signifies that they perceive the product as good quality and worth recommending to others. In conclusion, the review is undeniably positive. Despite the minor issue with the assembly instructions, the customer expresses satisfaction with the hamster cage, shipping time, and overall experience. Their intention to buy from the company again confirms the positive nature of this review and implies that they trust the company to deliver quality products in the future as well."},{"question":"Chelsey Tregear ( also known as Chelsey Nash ) is an Australian netball player who plays for the Melbourne Vixens in the ANZ Championship .

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

Solution:","response":"Dissimilar While both questions relate to the domain of mental health, specifically dealing with depression, they are asking about two different subjects. Sentence1: \\"How can I help a depressed friend?\\" is seeking advice on ways to support a friend who is suffering from depression. This could include ways to talk to them, activities that could help alleviate their symptoms, or insights on professional help they could seek. Sentence2: \\"Are there any social groups for people dealing with depression?\\" on the other hand, is seeking information about social support structures that exist for individuals suffering from depression. The person is asking about a more communal or group-based form of help, possibly as a supplement to other forms of treatment.

The facts should be easily found on the web (e.g. mentioned in a Wikipedia page) Term: Bengal cat, Description: Breed of cat, Question: Can a Bengal cat survive eating only pancakes?, Answer:No","response":"Term: Bengal cat Description: The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created by breeding an Asian leopard cat with a domestic cat. This breed is known for its distinctive coat, which resembles that of its wild counterparts, and its intelligent, active and energetic nature. Facts relevant to the question: 1. Bengal cats, like all cats, are obligate carnivores. This means that they require a diet primarily based on animal proteins to provide the essential nutrients they need. 2. Cats must consume certain amino acids, vitamins, and minerals from animal sources that are not found or are insufficient in plant-based diets. For example, cats require taurine, an amino acid found mainly in meat, to maintain healthy heart function and eyesight. A deficiency in taurine can lead to severe health problems. 3. Pancakes are typically made from flour, eggs, milk, and other ingredients. They are not a complete source of nutrition for Bengal cats and lack the necessary nutrients derived from animal proteins. 4. Feeding a Bengal cat a diet consisting of only pancakes can lead to malnutrition and serious health issues due to nutrient deficiencies. Given these facts, a Bengal cat cannot survive eating only pancakes, as they need a balanced diet that meets their specific nutritional requirements as obligate carnivores."},{"question":"Write the last sentence in this story.

Of the 228 readers who answered it, 108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion. Clearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and _ . It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure. Most of the respondents who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death. Both sides expressed equal love for their animals. More than a few respondents owned \\"the best dog/cat in the world\\". They thought of their pets as their \\"best friend\\", \\"a member of the family,\\"\\"the light of my life.\\" They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion.

Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle just might be the Tea Party's biggest gamble yet. A staunch conservative with a history of making bold and sometimes controversial comments, Angle insists her comments have been taken out of context in her campaign to oust Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in upcoming midterm congressional elections. \\"I'll be a mainstream senator,\\" said Angle. A grandmother of 10 children who secured the backing of Tea Party leaders on her way to winning the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, Angle has been both praised and criticized for her views. Of those Republicans who voted for","response":"Angle in the primary, a large number were attracted by her strict conservative ideology and commitment to Tea Party principles. These principles include a limited government, fiscal responsibility, and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Supporters were buoyed by Angle's bold and controversial statements, believing them to be indicative of her commitment to redirecting the course of politics in Washington, which they feel has veered too far from these conservative principles, and too often succumbs to compromise and partisanship. However, despite receiving significant support from the Tea Party and other conservatives, Angle's campaign has been criticized for its boundaries-pushing rhetoric. Some traditional Republicans, while agreeing in principle with the Tea Party's calls for smaller government and fiscal conservatism, were concerned that Angle's statements could alienate moderate voters in a state that is known for political independence. They worried that her controversial remarks could overshadow her policy positions and ultimately hurt her chances in the general election against Reid, a powerful and experienced politician. Moreover, Angle's rhetoric and the associated media coverage drew attention to a wider divide within the Republican Party. This divide was between the establishment Republicans, who believed that winning elections required attracting a broad coalition that included moderates and independents, and the insurgent Tea Party, who argued that the party had strayed too far from its conservative roots and needed to make a bold stand. The general election race against Reid was seen as crucial for the Republican Party and its prospects in the midterm elections. If Angle could unseat Reid, it would be a significant blow to the Democrats and could alter the balance of power in the Senate. On the other hand, if Reid were to win, it could be seen as a sign of the limits of Tea Party influence and its ability to win general elections. Thus, of those Republicans who voted for Angle in the primary, there was a mix of enthusiastic support for her uncompromising conservative stance, and cautious optimism that she could successfully challenge Reid in the general election. But across the board, there was an understanding that this was a high-risk gamble, with potential implications not only for the outcome of the Nevada Senate race, but for the overall direction of the Republican Party and the Tea Party movement as a whole."},{"question":"In this task, you're given a statement, the genre to which that statement belongs, and a label indicating if the statement should be agreed with (entailment), disagreed with (contradiction), or neither (neutral).

The ongoing tensions between the two nations have been exacerbated by a series of reports from the British media that have painted the Bulgarian police force in a negative light. The controversy initially emerged following an in-depth report by a prominent UK TV network, which exposed alleged corruption and abuse within the Bulgarian police department. The British investigation, led by renowned journalists, delved into various instances of suspected corruption and misconduct by Bulgarian police officers. It included interviews with victims, whistleblowers, and experts who provided damning evidence of these allegations. The documentary highlighted issues such as the misuse of power by some officers, participation in organized crime, and the systemic cover-up of illegal activities. In response to these accusations, the Bulgarian Police Chief strongly refuted the claims made in the report. He argued that the portrayal of the entire force as corrupt and abusive is unfounded and clearly demonstrates a bias against Bulgaria. He pointed out that any organization, irrespective of its size or influence, may have a few bad apples, but such incidences should not be taken as a blanket representation of the entire police force. Furthermore, the Police Chief stated that the Bulgarian police force comprises dedicated and honest officers who continuously work to protect and serve their country. He expressed his disappointment with the British TV network for failing to incorporate this side of the story in their documentary, which in his opinion, demonstrates an agenda driven approach by the channel to demonize the Bulgarian police force. The TV investigation has undoubtedly caused diplomatic ripples between the UK and Bulgaria. Advocates for the Bulgarian police have called for an apology from the British TV network for their ostensibly one-sided investigation, claiming that it has damaged the reputation of a committed and professional institution. Additionally, they argue that such accusations cast a shadow not only on the police force but also on the entire nation, potentially causing harm to the bilateral relations between the UK and Bulgaria. In the wake of this controversy, both sides have raised their concerns. While the supporters of the British TV investigation maintain that exposing corruption and abuse in any form is essential for a healthy democracy, the Bulgarian authorities argue that the report was incomplete and lacked the essential elements of journalistic integrity. As the story unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations and counter-allegations will influence the already tense relationship between the UK and Bulgaria. The British authorities may need to reconsider their approach in investigating similar issues in foreign countries, taking into account the sensitivity of international relations and the potential for affecting diplomatic ties. On the other hand, the Bulgarian authorities must also ensure that any instances of corruption or abuse of power within their police force are addressed promptly and effectively, upholding the rule of law and the trust of their citizens. In conclusion, the Bulgarian Police Chief's accusations of bias against the British TV investigation have sparked a heated debate surrounding journalistic ethics, the portrayal of foreign countries and institutions, and the impact of such reports on international relations. As both sides continue to present their cases, the need for transparent reporting and accountability becomes all the more crucial in fostering healthy democratic values and strengthening bilateral ties between countries."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","response":"Sure, little buddy!

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","response":"Yes, the information you found on Google is partially correct but it does not fully define the purpose of Vitamin D, nor its modes of acquisition. Vitamin D does indeed have dietary sources, but it can also be synthesized by our body as a response to sun exposure. To mainly answer your question, Vitamin D plays vital roles in our body, it's essential for various functions: 1. Bone Health: Vitamin D is critical for the absorption of calcium from the digestive tract into the bloodstream, promoting bone growth and remodeling, thereby preventing brittle, thin, or misshapen bones. The proper absorption of calcium contributes to the health of teeth as well. 2. Cell Growth Regulation: Vitamin D participates in cell growth regulation, cellular functions, and immune function. It helps modulate cell growth, promotes neuromuscular and immune health, and reduces inflammation, according to various studies. 3. Neuromuscular Functions: Vitamin D receptors are located throughout the body, including nerve cells, indicating its importance in neurologic and muscular function. Deficits in Vitamin D can lead to muscular weakness. 4. Immunity Boosting: Vitamin D has significant immune-boosting properties, and studies have suggested its role in preventing infections, or fighting against diseases especially autoimmune conditions. Your body manufactures vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight; specifically, ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from the sun triggers the formation of vitamin D in the skin. Therefore, it is called the 'sunshine vitamin'. But, people who live far from the equator or lead an indoor lifestyle may not obtain sufficient vitamin D from sunlight and therefore they do need to pay more attention to their diet or take supplements. Food Sources include fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna), beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and certain mushrooms. Given the importance of Vitamin D, people who have limited sun exposure or dietary intake might be advised by their healthcare provider to take a Vitamin D supplement to ensure they're getting enough. In short, the body's synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure and its dietary intake play a significant role in ensuring we have the level of this nutrient necessary for good health, even though the sun's contribution is often considered the primary source."},{"question":"Read this: LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits.

Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play \\"Wood Painting\\". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\". Here the motif of silence refers to the \\"silence of God,\\" which is a major theme of the film. - Fanny and Alexander is a Swedish drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 17 December 1982, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden in the 1900s. It was originally conceived as a four-part TV movie and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The TV version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut, at five hours and 12 minutes, is one of the longest cinematic films in history. - Cries and Whispers (lit. \\"Whispers and Cries\\") is a 1972 Swedish film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann. The film is set at a mansion at the end of the 19th century and is about two sisters and a maid who watch over their third sister on her deathbed, torn between fearing she might die and hoping that she will. After several unsuccessful experimental films, \\"Cries and Whispers\\" was a critical and commercial success. It received nominations for five Academy Awards. These included a nomination for Best Picture, which was unusual for a foreign-language film. What object entity has the relation of 'genre' with the subject 'a lesson in love'?

At the start of the movie, Walt is attending his wife's funeral, bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich (Christopher Carley). Similarly, he has little patience with his two sons, Mitch (Brian Haley) and Steve (Brian Howe), and their families, who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother. Throughout the movie Walt views his relatives as rude, spoiled and self-absorbed, always avoiding him unless it is in their own interest to pay him some attention. Walt's sons see him as \\"always disappointed\\" with them and their families, unaware of their own obnoxiousness. Father Janovich tells Walt that his late wife, Dorothy, made Father Janovich promise to try to get Walt to go to a confession. Walt writes Janovich off as knowing nothing about life or death, and insists on being called \\"Mr. Kowalski\\" rather than \\"Walt\\" because he feels he neither knows, nor wants to know, Father Janovich.Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors, a shy Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang) and his feisty sister Sue (Ahney Her), live with their widowed mother and grandmother. When a Hispanic gang confronts Thao, the Hmong gang, led by Thao's older cousin Spider (Doua Moua), helps Thao by frightening the Hispanic gang and forcing them to flee. The Hmong gang, at that point, tries to persuade Thao to join them. Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Gran Torino Sport. Walt interrupts the robbery, pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee. After a few days, Spider and his gang return.

Another man then kills him with a sledgehammer to the face. A journalist, Carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing. Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling or too busy to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric's luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric's journal. Later in her home while reading Eric's journal, she has a dream of Eric with bloody eyes who tells her \\"leave me alone\\". Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric's journal. Although English is taught in the villages' school, not all the villagers know how (or are willing) to speak it.

What is the significance of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"Question 1: What are some of our freedoms? Answer: Some of the essential freedoms enjoyed by individuals living in democratic societies include: 1. Freedom of speech and expression: This fundamental freedom allows individuals to express their opinions and thoughts without fear of persecution or censorship. It facilitates a robust exchange of ideas, promoting the growth of knowledge, creativity, and understanding. 2. Freedom of religion and belief: People are free to choose, practice, and change their religious beliefs or follow a secular ethical system without interference or coercion from the state. This freedom supports religious diversity, tolerance, and coexistence. 3. Freedom of assembly and association: This allows individuals to come together with others in groups, organizations, or peaceful assemblies to discuss, debate, and promote common interests, further supporting collective decision-making and ideation processes. 4. Freedom of movement: Individuals possess the right to move within their country and to leave or return to it, subject to reasonable restrictions. This freedom supports cultural exchange, personal growth, and social mobility. 5. Freedom of the press and media: A free and independent press is an important aspect of a democratic society. It helps hold governments accountable, ensure transparency, and educate the public about social, political, and economic issues. 6. Right to privacy: This grants individuals protection from undue surveillance and interference in their personal lives by the state or other entities. Ensuring personal boundaries and autonomy is essential for maintaining human dignity and fostering a sense of security. 7. Right to education: Education is a fundamental human right that equips individuals with the necessary skills and tools to engage positively in society. Access to education enables people to pursue their potential and contribute to the progress of their communities. 8. Right to vote and participate in governance: By guaranteeing the right to vote, democratic societies empower their citizens to have a say in the formation and operation of their government. This fosters accountability and inclusion in the political process. 9. Right to equality before the law: This right ensures that everybody enjoys the same legal rights, protections, and privileges, regardless of race, gender, age, disability, or other characteristics. It promotes social justice, fairness, and unity. 10. Right to property: Individuals have the right to own and protect their property. Economically, this right encourages entrepreneurship and innovation, as people can accumulate wealth and make decisions about its use. Question 2: What is the significance of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Answer: The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, enacted on April 17, 1982, is a cornerstone of Canada's Constitution, signifying the country's commitment to the protection of individual rights and liberties. The Charter guarantees various fundamental rights and freedoms, including those mentioned in the answer to the first question, while also striking a balance between personal freedom and societal interests. Some key aspects of the Charter's significance are: 1. Constitutional protection: The Charter provides for a strong legal foundation for the defense of human rights, providing constitutional safeguards against potential government abuses or other violations. 2. Balancing individual rights with societal values: The Charter accounts for the fact that individual rights must sometimes be limited to protect the greater good and maintain social harmony. It includes provisions known as \\"reasonable limits\\" and the \\"notwithstanding clause,\\" which allow governments to enact laws that may restrict specific rights under certain justified circumstances. 3. Guarantees democratic and legal rights: The Charter secures the essential rights and liberties that underpin a democratic society, including voting rights, the right to a fair trial, and protection against arbitrary detention. 4. Promotes equality and non-discrimination: The Charter includes provisions that promote equality and protect against discrimination based on race, gender, religion, age, disability, and other characteristics. These provisions strengthen social cohesion and enhance Canada's multicultural character. 5. Judicial oversight and interpretation: Canadian courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada, play a critical role in interpreting the Charter and reviewing existing laws or actions to ensure they align with the constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms. Lastly, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question seeks information about the various fundamental freedoms enjoyed by individuals in democratic societies. In contrast, the second question specifically asks about the significance of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and its role within Canada's constitutional framework. While they both relate to individual rights and liberties, their focus and scope are different."},{"question":"Theprojectwebsiteoffersteachingandlearningresources,Web-basedactivitiesandacompetition.

Just look at the self-satisfaction on the face of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones when he knelt, uselessly, with his team before the performance of last night’s national anthem. That’s the look of a man who knows he’s taken something that has nothing to do with him and turned it to his own ends. Unity. That’s the name of the detergent that Roger Goodell, the owners, and the most desperate stooges in the media are going to use to scrub this Trump vs. Sports mess until all that’s left is a shiny, useless bauble. We’re already well on our way. The NFL is literally using this for brand marketing: Colin Kaepernick took a knee for a specific reason: He was protesting police brutality and the unfair treatment of minorities in this country. And while plenty of chuds were happy to mock it as the vacant posturing of a multi-millionaire with nothing on the line, the fact is that not only was he risking something—his career, as it turned out—but it was part of something broader. Kaepernick has put his time and his money behind causes that seek to make this country a better one for the oppressed. The same is true of other players who have demonstrated before games. Malcolm Jenkins and Anquan Boldin, just to name two, have lobbied for criminal justice reform on Capitol Hill and supported organizations that provide career counseling to low-income minority men. These are actions taken in pursuit of concrete solutions to real problems, and they’re what every pre-game act of protest is meant to draw attention to. But where does the attention lie now? For as much as the events of the past weekend were framed as Trump going to war with the NFL, our bum of a president did Roger Goodell and the league a huge favor. All they had to do was release a few limp-dick statements tsk-tsking Trump’s comments for their divisiveness, come up with a few meaningless shows of pseudo-solidarity like we saw in Arizona last night, and poof: Suddenly the anthem protests aren’t about a very specific set of problems plaguing this country, but about “unity,” a cause more hollow than anything 25 branding execs could ever dream up in a conference room. Roger Goodell is on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Colin Kaepernick isn’t. Advertisement The worst irony here may be the way the NFL’s new marketing initiative not only appropriates the protests, but perverts their meaning. Kaepernick’s protest and the ones that followed were divisive, and were meant to be: That was the point, to ask people to choose sides, and to direct their attention to what’s going on in the real world beyond sports. Goodell and the owners, in asking everyone to come together around the cause of the NFL itself, have done what they always do, and made what they’ve touched cheaper and smaller. It’s been weeks since a coalition of NFL players sent a memo pleading with Goodell to offer real, tangible support for their activism. Included in that memo was a specific list of activities that Goodell could take part in in order to help them achieve their goals of bail reform, increased police transparency, and passage of Clean Slate legislation. Who knows if Goodell has done any of the things he was asked to do in that memo, or if he ever planned on working with the players at all. What’s clear now, though, is that he doesn’t have to if he doesn’t want to. Advertisement All he has to do now is remain united with his players in favor of the NFL and good things like vague civic virtues, and against bad ones like any actual discussion of how to make good on the promises those virtues offer. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a short version of a longer text, story, or conversation.

Make a tracing table.","response":"To accomplish the goal of making a tracing table, also known as a lightbox, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather materials and tools: - A wooden or plastic container (could be a shallow box or drawer) will serve as the base for your tracing table. The size of the box will depend on the desired size of your tracing table. - A sheet of plexiglass or clear, sturdy plastic - this will serve as the top surface where you'll place your drawings or designs to trace. - LED strip lights or a small LED lamp - these will provide the light source for your tracing table. - Frosted white or translucent paper or film - this will help distribute light evenly across the top surface. - Ruler, pencil, and masking tape - Wood glue, nails, or screws (depending on the material of your base) - Drill and drill bits - Jigsaw (optional) - Sandpaper - Protective eyewear and gloves 2. Measure and cut the plexiglass or plastic sheet: - Measure the inner dimensions of your container and cut the plexiglass sheet to match using a jigsaw or have it cut at your local hardware store. Make sure to leave a small gap (approximately 1/8 inch) around the edges for easy installation and removal. - Sand the edges of the cut sheet to remove any sharp edges. 3. Prepare the light source: - If using LED strip lights, measure the interior surface of the container base and cut the LED strips accordingly. Connect the cut LED strips in series or parallel, depending on your desired brightness and voltage requirements. - If using a small LED lamp, choose a position inside the container that will provide even light distribution. 4. Install the LED lights: - Attach the LED strip lights or lamp to the inside of the container using glue or mounting hardware. Make sure the lights are secure and the wiring is neatly organized. - Drill a hole in one of the container's sides to accommodate the power cord and any connectors. This will allow you to plug in the lights externally. 5. Install the frosted white or translucent paper or film: - Cut the frosted paper or film to fit the interior dimensions of the container. - Secure the paper or film in place using masking tape, ensuring it is smooth and wrinkle-free. This layer will help diffuse the light for more even illumination on the work surface. 6. Place the plexiglass or plastic sheet on top: - Carefully place the cut plexiglass or plastic sheet on top of the container, nesting it within the edges. Make sure the sheet is clean and free from dust or smudges for the best tracing results. 7. Test your tracing table: - Plug in your LED lights and turn on the tracing table. Place a reference image on the surface, and put a blank sheet of paper on top. You should be able to see the reference image through the blank sheet, allowing you to trace the design easily. 8. Secure the plexiglass sheet (optional): - If you want to secure the top sheet in place, you can use wood glue, nails, or screws, depending on the material of your container. Make sure not to overtighten the screws or apply too much pressure, as this could crack or damage the plexiglass. Congratulations! You've successfully made a tracing table or lightbox that you can use for your various tracing, design, and artistic needs."},{"question":"Given the following context: A childhood accident leaves Leo mute and his devout Amish mother refuses surgery.

The memory of one particular incident, where Klopp stood in the sunshine of Basel's St Jakob-Park Stadium with his players gathered around him, hangs as a poignant testament of his charisma and the connection he shares with his \\"Reds\\". The Setting: St Jakob-Park Stadium, Basel St Jakob-Park Stadium is the home ground of FC Basel and is known for hosting several high-profile matches and events. Located in the beautiful city of Basel, Switzerland, the venue played host to the UEFA Europa League Final on May 18, 2016. The epic battle between Liverpool and Sevilla ended in a heartbreak as the Spanish team defeated the Anfield side 3-1. Yet, despite that defeat, a powerful image of the team's identity and spirit emerged. The Moment of Unity As the Liverpool squad stood together in the heart of Basel's magnificent St Jakob-Park, soaking in the bright afternoon sunshine, it was clear that the manager's profound influence had brought them to a different level of connection. Klopp stood in the center, wearing his familiar glasses and casual outfit, addressing his players with intensity and passion. The face of each player unequivocally revealed the respect they held for their manager, hanging on to every single word he spoke. Klopp's Philosophy: Power in Togetherness From his time at Borussia Dortmund to his current spell with Liverpool, Klopp has consistently focused not only on team chemistry but also on the collective strength of his players. \\"You'll never walk alone,\\" the anthem of Liverpool FC, resonates with his profound belief that in unity, a team can overcome any obstacle. Jurgen Klopp does not shy away from expressing his emotions, and this only seems to draw people towards him. His formidable team talks, coupled with genuine care for his players, inspire loyalty and camaraderie among them. The Basel incident highlighted the crux of Klopp's coaching approach: Establishing a bond that is unwavering, driven by passion, and fuelled by a hunger to create a legacy. Impact on Liverpool's Performance Since that fateful day in Basel, Liverpool has seen a remarkable rise in its fortunes under the stewardship of Jurgen Klopp. The team clinched the UEFA Champions League in 2019, followed by winning their first-ever Premier League title in 2020. This marked the end of a 30-year-long drought for the Anfield side.

The answer is:","response":"Smith's Magazine and Fit Pregnancy are both examples of print media, specifically falling under the category of magazines. Print media, as the name suggests, refers to those forms of media that are primarily transmitted and disseminated through physical means, such as books, newspapers, and magazines. Print media has been a significant method of communication and information dissemination for centuries, with its roots dating back to the invention of the Gutenberg printing press in the 15th century. Smith's Magazine, as the name implies, is a magazine that covers a variety of topics, often focusing on current events, pop culture, fashion, and lifestyle. It features interviews, informative articles, and well-researched stories that appeal to a diverse readership. The magazine covers both national and international news, often through the lens of the magazine's unique perspective. Smith's Magazine is available in both print and digital formats, which means that subscribers can either receive the physical magazine in their mailboxes or access the content online through a website or app. Fit Pregnancy, on the other hand, specifically caters to pregnant women and new mothers, addressing their unique needs and concerns during this life stage. The magazine provides articles and resources on prenatal and postnatal care, nutrition, fitness, fashion, and lifestyle tips specifically tailored for pregnant women and new mothers. This niche focus helps the magazine cater to its target audience more effectively, offering specialized information that its readers are unlikely to find in general-purpose magazines.

This description aligns with option C, which emphasizes that a good deal was made. Option A, \\"feeling skilled,\\" could potentially be a description of Lee, but it doesn't directly address the context of the handshake on the business deal. While Lee may be a skilled negotiator or excel at his profession, this detail isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Option B, \\"feeling passive,\\" seems to contrast with the context provided, as Lee actively engages in the business deal and shakes Alex’s hand. This implies an active and even assertive participant in the deal, rather than someone exhibiting a passive attitude.

It is distinct from rice starch, which is usually produced by steeping rice in lye. Rice flour is a particularly good substitute for wheat flour, which irritates the digestive system of some people. Rice flour is also used as a thickening agent in recipes that are refrigerated or frozen since it inhibits liquid separation. OPT: [I] no. [II] yes. Is this statement correct \\"is rice powder and rice flour the same\\"?","response":"Yes, the statement \\"is rice powder and rice flour the same\\" is correct. Rice flour and rice powder are two terms used interchangeably to describe the same product. Both are made from finely milled rice grains and have similar properties and uses in cooking and baking. Rice flour is known for its versatility as a substitute for wheat flour in many recipes, especially for people experiencing gluten intolerance or celiac disease. There are different types of rice flour available based on the type of rice used for milling. These include: 1. White Rice Flour: Made from finely milled white rice, this is the most common type of rice flour. It has a mild, neutral taste and can easily be incorporated into various recipes. 2. Brown Rice Flour: Brown rice flour is prepared using unpolished brown rice, which retains the bran and germ layers. It has a nuttier flavor and higher nutritional content compared to white rice flour. 3. Glutinous Rice Flour: Also known as sticky rice flour or sweet rice flour, this type is made from short-grain glutinous rice, which is starchier than other varieties. Glutinous rice flour is commonly used in Asian desserts and dishes requiring a sticky, chewy texture. Rice flour applications and benefits: 1. Gluten-Free Baking: As a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, rice flour can be used in baking recipes like bread, pancakes, waffles, muffins, cookies, and cakes. It may require blending with other flours or modifying the recipe to achieve the desired texture. 2. Thickening Agent: Rice flour serves as an excellent thickening agent for sauces, gravies, and soups. Since it does not form lumps and dissolves easily, it is preferred over wheat flour for thickening purposes in many cuisines. 3. Coating for Frying: Rice flour can be used as a coating for deep frying or pan-frying food items, providing a crispy, golden-brown crust. 4. Noodle Making: Rice flour is a primary ingredient in making gluten-free noodles, such as Vietnamese rice noodles and Japanese udon noodles. As a versatile, gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, rice flour (also known as rice powder) offers a suitable option for those with dietary restrictions or individuals seeking new flavors and textures in their recipes. Its wide range of applications and benefits make rice flour an essential ingredient in many culinary traditions around the world."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about leonel wilfredo ruiz can be gathered from the following bio?

When you do wash your hair 24 to 48 hours prior, make sure that you only use shampoo. Conditioner will prevent the dye from adhering. Put on a shirt that you won't mind staining, then wrap an old towel or a plastic cape around your shoulders. Coat your hairline, the tips of your ears, and the back of your neck with petroleum jelly. Finally, pull on a pair of plastic gloves. Work in an area that is easy to clean, such as a bathroom or kitchen. If you are worried about staining the counters or floors, cover them with newspaper, paper bags, or plastic bags. It is easier to dye your hair in layers .5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) thick rather than in sections. Part your hair across the back of your head at about ear-level. Pull everything above the part into a bun. Secure the bun with a claw-clip. It'll be the easier to remove and replace. If you have very thick hair, you may want to part it even lower so that you are working with thinner sections. If your hair is too short to pull into a bun, use clips. If you have chin-length or shorter hair, you may not have to do this step at all. Some dyes come in a kit that already include the dye and developer. For other dyes, you must purchase the developer separately. Follow the instructions that came with the dye to find out how you should mix them. You can mix the dye in the squeeze bottles that came in the kit, or you can mix it in a non-metal bowl. If you are lightening your hair, add 1 to 3 packets of toner. The more packets you use, the ashier the final color will be. If you can't find packets of toner, don't worry; you can wash your hair with purple shampoo afterwards to remove brassy hints. Take a thin strand of hair from an inconspicuous area, such as your nape, and apply the dye to it. Cover the strand with plastic wrap, and let the dye sit for the time recommended on the bottle. Rinse the dye out with cool water, then let it dry. You don't have to use conditioner for this since this is just a strand test. Although not absolutely necessary, strand tests are highly recommended because the color may come out differently from what you expect. If the dye did not turn out the way you wanted it, you’ll have to buy a different color.","response":"The article provides guidelines for dyeing hair at home while ensuring minimal damage and maximizing color adherence. First, wash your hair 24 to 48 hours before dyeing, using only shampoo. Avoid using conditioner, as it may prevent the dye from sticking. To protect your clothes and surroundings from staining, wear an old shirt, cover your shoulders with a towel or plastic cape, and place newspapers or plastic bags on the surface you'll be working on. Next, apply petroleum jelly to your hairline, ear tips, and back of the neck to protect your skin. Wearing plastic gloves, work in sections of 0.5-1 inch thick layers. Specifically, part your hair at ear-level, pulling the upper part into a bun and secure it with a claw-clip. Short-haired individuals may not need this step and can use clips instead.

Use a non-metal bowl or the provided squeeze bottle to mix the dye. When using bleach, add 1 to 3 packets of toner for an ashier final color, or use purple shampoo afterward if toner is unavailable. Before applying the dye, it is recommended to perform a strand test. Apply the dye to an inconspicuous area and let it sit for the recommended time on the bottle. Rinse with cool water and let it dry, without using conditioner. A strand test helps determine if the color will turn out as expected; if not, a different color must be purchased.

No refills were needed. Even worse for CVS: De Maria, 60, works in the drug industry and knows a thing or two about how the game gets played. \\"These automatic refills have become a standard industry practice,\\" she told me. \\"They have become very prevalent.\\" Federal and state authorities launched investigations into unauthorized refills after I wrote columns about how CVS and other drugstores were routinely signing up customers for automatic refills without their approval. CVS, for its part, blamed the practice on rogue drugstore managers and insisted that the company's official policy was that customers are always asked before being enrolled in ReadyFill, the chain's refill program. But I've obtained company documents showing that CVS pharmacists are expected to enroll at least 40% of patients into ReadyFill. Failure to do so, pharmacists say, can result in reduced compensation or even being fired. Some CVS pharmacists have told me that, because of the investigations, company managers quietly told them to ease up on the automatic refills. But recent reports of people still being enrolled in ReadyFill without approval indicate that not all stores have gotten the message. Indianapolis resident Bill Rainsberger, 55, said he was notified by his local CVS recently that a refill was ready for a medicine he'd already stopped taking. \\"I never, ever signed up for automatic refills,\\" he said. \\"I didn't even know they had such a thing.\\" Mike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, declined to answer when I asked what steps the company has taken to reduce incidents of people being enrolled in ReadyFill without their permission. He said only that customers can call (800) SHOP-CVS, or (800) 746-7287, to report any prescription-related problems. De Maria works as a sales rep for a leading drug company. After she received the calls from CVS about her 23-year-old son's prescription being refilled, she headed straight to the pharmacy. She said she asked a worker how her son had been enrolled in ReadyFill. The worker insisted that he must have asked to be included in the program. \\"So I told her to show me the proof that he'd signed up,\\" De Maria recalled. \\"Show me anything that proves this. She couldn't do it.\\" De Maria told me that pharmacies and prescription benefit managers — the companies that manage drug benefits for insurers and employers — have realized there's a lot of money to be made from automatic refills. \\"They bill insurers for it, they get paid for it,\\" she said. \\"And most of the time the prescription isn't picked up and it goes back on the shelf, although the insurer might not be reimbursed.\\" At CVS, De Maria said, the store's pharmacist eventually got involved and agreed to remove her son from ReadyFill and reverse the prescription so that her insurer would be paid back. \\"As the pharmacist was fixing things, I told her I couldn't believe that they were still doing this,\\" De Maria said. \\"Hadn't they had enough negative press?\\" What did the pharmacist say? Summary:","response":"A growing number of CVS customers have raised concerns about unauthorized prescription refills, despite the company's claims to the contrary. Federal and state authorities even launched investigations into the widespread accusations. While CVS has blamed this practice on rogue store managers, evidence suggests that pharmacists are expected to enroll at least 40% of patients into ReadyFill, the chain's refill program. CVS pharmacists have reported that failing to do so would result in reduced compensation or job termination, and that company managers have asked them to be less aggressive in automatic refills due to the investigations. However, recent cases show that customers continue to be enrolled in ReadyFill without their consent. One notable case involves De Maria, an industry insider who works as a sales rep for a major drug company. After receiving calls about her son's prescription refill - a temporary medication for a skin problem - she criticized the scheme. According to De Maria, pharmacies and prescription benefit managers have been benefitting financially from these automatic refills, which often result in unused medications going back on the shelf while the insurers bear the cost, without being reimbursed most of the time. Despite awareness and public outcry about such practices, it seems that not all CVS stores have adjusted their practices accordingly. The CVS company spokesman, Mike DeAngelis, has not provided insight into what steps the company has taken to prevent people from being enrolled into ReadyFill without their permission."},{"question":"Translate \\"I am therefore strongly in favour of the creation of training opportunities for Muslims in Europe, particularly in theology, and I advocate this in the report.\\" to Finnish?","response":"Olen siis voimakkaasti sitä mieltä, että Euroopassa tulisi luoda koulutusmahdollisuuksia muslimeille, erityisesti teologiassa, ja kannatan tätä raportissa.

After busting a human trafficking ring led by Sheriff Wood, Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner, whom he has been working with during his travels and has become his closest friend – only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained. Turner's attorney, Colonel Bob Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute. Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor. Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen.
