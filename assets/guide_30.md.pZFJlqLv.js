Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's boyfriend, even though their relationship was \\"on the rocks\\" at that time. Patroni and Murdock take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake. En route, they communicate with Pryor, learning that the autopilot is keeping the aircraft in level flight, but it is inoperable for turns. The jet is heading into the Wasatch Mountains, so Murdock starts to guide Pryor...

John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833.

The de facto strategy of past and present Israeli governments of seeking security through domination and by pushing Palestinians out of their homes, or allowing right-wing religious fanatics to create settlements throughout the West Bank to ensure that no Palestinian state could have contiguous parts, has not and cannot work to provide safety for Israel. Israel's fate and its well-being are intrinsically linked to the well-being of the Palestinian people. It's time for the powerful to show generosity to the relatively powerless. A similar path would make the","response":"most sense for other conflict-ridden nations and regions around the world, as true security and stability can only be achieved through mutual understanding, cooperation, and a genuine desire to address the needs and grievances of all parties involved. Building trust and rapport among various factions within a society, rather than exacerbating division, is crucial in fostering a lasting peace that benefits all. For example, the long-standing tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir have given rise to numerous armed conflicts and continued unrest over the years. Both nations could prioritize diplomatic efforts, such as initiating comprehensive dialogues that address key issues, including demilitarization, economic cooperation, and cultural exchanges. By doing so, they might foster an environment that would enable a peaceful and mutually beneficial resolution to the conflict. Similarly, the ongoing crisis in Syria, which has led to immense suffering and displacement of millions of individuals, necessitates a multifaceted approach that addresses both the immediate humanitarian concerns and the underlying political and economic factors feeding the conflict. This could entail establishing formal channels for open negotiations among the opposing factions, providing assistance for the reconstruction of devastated communities, and creating opportunities for Syrians to participate in the rebuilding of their nation. Countries dealing with internal strife, such as Yemen or South Sudan, could also benefit from working towards equitable and inclusive governance systems that ensure the representation of various ethnic, religious, and political groups. This would require the establishment of dialogues, power-sharing agreements, and measures that strengthen the rule of law and protect human rights. By building bridges instead of walls, these nations could foster reconciliation and pave the way for peace and prosperity. Furthermore, in cases where external forces have a significant influence on the conflict, such as the United States in Afghanistan or Russia in Ukraine, it is essential for these powers not to exacerbate tensions but rather to take on a more constructive role in the peace process. This may involve promoting diplomatic channels and regional cooperation, as well as providing support for rebuilding infrastructure, ensuring the safety and security of local populations, and fostering economic development. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage would be to assert that adopting a similar approach as proposed for Israel – prioritizing peace, mutual understanding, and respect for the rights and dignity of all parties involved – can contribute to resolving conflicts more effectively and sustainably than attempts to dominate or marginalize opposing factions. By recognizing that the fate and well-being of all communities involved in these disputes are intrinsically linked, nations and powerful entities across the world can work collectively toward creating a more just, equitable, and secure global order."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: 960","response":"Question: How many minutes are there in a 16-hour work shift? Justification: A 16-hour work shift can often be observed in some professions that demand continuous monitoring and attention, such as healthcare professionals, firefighters, and security personnel. It is crucial to calculate the total minutes in a 16-hour shift to assess factors like productivity, labor laws compliance, and staff scheduling. Answer: There are 960 minutes in a 16-hour work shift. Explanation: To find out the total minutes in a 16-hour shift, you have to multiply the number of hours by the minutes per hour. 1 hour = 60 minutes 16 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes.

Read and understand both sentences. Sentence A: \\"An actor wear a toaster.\\" Sentence B: \\"An actor can wear a costume.\\" 2. Analyze the grammatical correctness of the sentences. Sentence A has incorrect grammar as it should say \\"an actor wears a toaster\\" or \\"an actor is wearing a toaster.\\" Sentence B has correct grammar. 3. Consider the meaning of each sentence within its context. In Sentence A, the concept of an actor wearing a toaster is unusual and not functional within the acting profession. Toasters are appliances used in food preparation, not as clothing items or accessories, and they do not have a logical role in acting. In Sentence B, the concept of an actor wearing a costume is logical within the context of the acting profession. Actors often wear costumes to portray characters in movies, plays, or other performances. 4. Compare the meanings of both sentences and determine which one does not make sense. Sentence A doesn't make sense because the idea of an actor wearing a toaster is incongruent and nonsensical. Sentence B makes sense because actors wearing costumes is expected and part of their job. 5.

First, we have to combine the parts that are alike. The puzzle pieces that are alike are \\"36*r\\" and \\"96*r\\". If you combine these two, you'll get \\"132*r\\". So the equation (that's just a fancy word for problem) now looks like this: \\"132*r - 519 = -1707\\". Next, we want to get r alone. It's like he's playing hide and seek, and we have to find him. Right now, 519 is with r on one side. As we need to find r alone, we help 519 to move to the other side. But here is a rule: if 519 was being taken away (-519) on the left side, when he moves, it becomes adding (+519) on the right side. So now, we have \\"132*r = -1707 + 519\\". When we add -1707 and 519 together, we get -1188. Now we have \\"132*r = -1188\\". This simply means 132 times some number r equals -1188. Now, to get r completely by itself, we have to get rid of 132. Since we multiply, to do the opposite, we divide. We divide both sides of the equation by 132, so on the left, it cancels out and r is alone! So now we have \\"r = -1188 / 132\\". Divide -1188 by 132, and we find out that r is equal to -9. So, we've found r in our hide and seek game, and he was hiding as the number -9!"},{"question":"Context: In times like this , one wonders if one needs a refresher course in systematic theology to try to understand God .

If the pain lasts longer or they are really intense, call your doctor and tell him or her about your symptoms because it might be a more serious problem. Sometimes it helps to lean a little bit to the side that hurts; this way, you can relax the muscles in that area and reduce the pain you feel. To relieve a cramp in your leg, lie on your back momentarily and then extend the affected leg while keeping the knee straight. Try to position yourself so that the foot is bent backwards until the pain is gone. Another means of stretching the legs is by riding a stationary bike for 30 minutes daily. Brisk walking is also a way of improving circulation in the lower extremities. You might be tempted to use some medication for treating the pain; it is very important to know that many of the drugs used today, unfortunately, may have severe adverse or teratogenic effects (they can lead to congenital malformations or other abnormalities). Because of this, it is important to check with your doctor before using any over-the-counter medications. Consider taking acetaminophen (the brand name is Tylenol) because it is considered a safe drug to take during pregnancy. The recommended dosage is 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours (unless stated otherwise by your physician). Another frequently used drug for pain relief is ibuprofen (Nurofen and other trademarks); this must be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester because it promotes premature closure of a fetal structure called ductus arteriosus (DA). You might try to reduce the pain by applying a warm compress to the area where you are experiencing cramps. However, be careful not to keep it against your skin for too long as it may cause nerve damage to your skin. Once you begin to feel relief, remove the warm compress. You can apply the warm compress to the area again if the cramps come back. You can also consider taking a warm bath rather than using a warm compress. The heat will have a soothing effect on your muscles, which can help to calm cramps that you have.

As a prominent figure in international politics and a strong advocate for global security, Clinton's critical remarks come amid growing concerns over the complexities and challenges of the global war against terror. Speaking in front of a packed audience, Clinton underscored the crucial role of Pakistan in the ongoing fight against terrorism, particularly against Al-Qaeda. She accused the South Asian nation of not doing enough to identify and dismantle the intricate network of Al-Qaeda operatives within its borders. The lecture emphasized the importance of taking swift and decisive action against the terrorist organization, insisting that failure to do so could result in dire consequences, not only for Pakistan but also for the entire world. Clinton's stringent stance against Pakistan's efforts to counter Al-Qaeda was grounded on several crucial factors that have arisen in the past few years. Among these is the longstanding suspicion that Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), has been covertly supporting and protecting extremist groups, spending years indirectly bolstering the Al-Qaeda network. Adding to her argument, Clinton pointed out that Osama bin Laden, the figurehead of the international terrorist conglomerate, was discovered and killed in 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The fact that the Al-Qaeda leader was living in close proximity to a Pakistani military academy raised alarms regarding the nation's commitment to eradicating the deeply entrenched terrorist network. Furthermore, Clinton expressed her exasperation at Pakistan's seeming lack of appreciation for the assistance provided by the United States. Over the years, the US has invested billions of dollars in military and civilian aid to Pakistan, seeking to foster collaboration in the fight against terrorism. However, Clinton suggested that a substantial portion of this aid had been misused or misdirected, with little to show in terms of concrete results. Despite these harsh criticisms, the former Secretary of State acknowledged that Pakistan had made some progress in its campaign against terrorism, primarily against homegrown extremist groups, such as the Pakistani Taliban. However, she implored the nation to do more and expand its focus towards stamping out all forms of terrorism. \\"Pakistan must recognize that there can be no distinction between 'good terrorists' and 'bad terrorists,'\\" Clinton stated unequivocally. Toward the end of her address, Hillary Clinton issued a stern warning to Pakistan, emphasizing the inevitability of international isolation should it persist in its lackluster approach to the crisis of terrorism. She urged the Pakistani government to reassess its priorities and security strategies, imploring that time is of the essence. With the world watching closely, Pakistan's response to Clinton's lecture will be a critical indicator of its commitment to the global war against terror. Only through unity and relentless determination can peace and security be restored to the vulnerable regions devastated by the scourge of terrorism."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

M. E. McTaggart. In this paper McTaggart proposes two \\"temporal series\\". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, simpliciter and in comparison to each other. The B-series eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than.\\" Answer: A:","response":"To put McTaggart's concepts of the A-series and B-series into practice, one could approach the study of time in a more comprehensive and structured manner. This can be done through the following steps: 1. Analyze and understand the differences between the A-series and B-series: Begin by studying McTaggart's paper and other related philosophical works to gain a deep understanding of the two temporal series. 2. Apply the A-series to real-life scenarios: Consider everyday occurrences and situations where our perception of time seems to have a \\"moving now\\" quality, such as attending a live sports event or experiencing anticipation for a future event. Observe how the concepts of past, present, and future play out in such scenarios. 3. Apply the B-series to scientific and objective studies of time: In disciplines like physics and cosmology, time is often considered devoid of the subjective notions of past, present, and future. Study examples and theories, such as the block universe model or time dilation in special relativity, where temporal relations are based solely on the concepts of \\"earlier than\\" and \\"later than.\\" 4. Compare and contrast the implications of the two series: Examine the strengths and weaknesses of both A-series and B-series in explaining our experience of time, as well as their implications on questions of time's objectivity or subjectivity, and the nature of causality. 5. Engage in philosophical debates and discussions: Join relevant forums, attend seminars, or participate in academic conferences where themes related to the philosophy of time are discussed. Engage with others who may have differing views on the A-series and B-series or temporal ontology in general. 6. Apply these concepts to interdisciplinary studies: Consider how these ideas about time might be applied to other fields, such as psychology, storytelling, or history. For example, explore how the perception of time might differ between individuals or cultures, or how narratives use the A-series and B-series concepts to create suspense or convey themes of fate or free will. By applying the A-series and B-series concepts in these ways, one can deepen their understanding of how time operates both in our subjective experiences and as an objective feature of the world, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to the study of time."},{"question":"jordan 's boss eddie jordan promised here on thursday that he would fight to stay in next season 's formula one championship despite the tough situation he faces .

The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular.

Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa, made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.

Answer the above question based on the context below: R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors.

I've certainly noticed some pupils being feverishly overgenerous of late. Last year, I received not one bottle of wine but four for helping a disaffected pupil through his GCSEs. By and large, my colleagues report the gifts differing along gender lines. Gentlemen get ties, mugs, booze and, if they're really lucky, tickets to football matches. The ladies are often presented with flowers, jewels, chocolates and so on. When my son was at private school, I noticed there was a real competitiveness between the students about giving presents to teachers, with expensive baskets from fancy stores and huge bouquets being handed out on the last days of term. Since my wife and I only let my son give thank-you cards, it was clear we were not \\"classy\\". Now he is at an inner-city primary, we've noticed that this kind of _ seems to have more or less disappeared. For one thing, there isn't that kind of money floating around - but there isn't that kind of competitive culture either. Personally, I think gifts to teachers should be banned beyond the thank-you card: they cause many more problems than they solve, creating insecurity in both parents and staff. Perhaps the recession and the lack of money in people's pockets might be a good excuse for the government to issue some guidelines to schools that gifts shouldn't be accepted by teachers. The gifts that I really value are the cards which say a genuine thank you. I still keep them in a file at home.","response":"According to the article, what is the author's view on giving gifts to teachers, and what are some possible consequences or effects of the practice?

The author opposes all forms of appreciation, including thank-you cards and gifts, as they create competition between students. D.

The launching of the hull is seen as the beginning of a new era of German sea power. Two years later, in 1941, British convoys are being ravaged by U-boats and surface raider attacks that cut off supplies essential for Britain's abilities to continue the war. In May, British intelligence discovers the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen are about to break out of the Baltic and into the North Atlantic to attack convoys. Meanwhile, a spy in Norway spots the Bismarck and its escort Prinz Eugen; he attempts to alert the British by telegraph but he is discovered by the Germans and killed. The spy is only able to message that one of the ships is Prince Eugen but is shot before he can message that the second ship was the Bismarck. The man assigned to co-ordinate the hunt is the Admiralty's chief of operations, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More), who has been distraught over the death of his wife in an air raid and the sinking of his ship by German ships commanded by Admiral GÃ¼nther LÃ¼tjens (Karel Å tÄpÃ¡nek). Upon receiving his new post, Shepard discovers LÃ¼tjens is the fleet commander on the Bismarck. Shepard's experience of conflict with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and his understanding of LÃ¼tjens allow him to predict the Bismarck's movements. Shepard acts coldly to his staff but comes increasingly to rely on the coolness and skill of his assistant, WRNS Second Officer Anne Davis (Dana Wynter). LÃ¼tjens is also bitter. After the First World War, he considered that he had received no recognition for his efforts in the war. LÃ¼tjens promises the captain of the Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann (Carl MÃ¶hner), that this time, he and Germany will be remembered in greatness.

At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., what would be the answer ?","response":"Based on the information given in the article, the answer to the question \\"Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool?\\" cannot be definitively determined, as it is not specifically mentioned.

While an international dispute causes tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the Discovery. Although the Soviet ship, the Leonov, will be ready before the American spacecraft Discovery Two, the Soviets need American astronauts to help board the Discovery and investigate the malfunction of the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, which caused the disaster. The US government agrees to a joint mission when it is determined that Discovery will crash into Jupiter's moon Io before Discovery Two is ready. Floyd, along with Discovery designer Walter Curnow and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra, joins the Soviet mission. Upon arriving at Jupiter, the crew detect signs of life on Jupiter's seemingly barren moon Europa. They send an unmanned probe down to Europa to investigate the unusual readings, but just as it finds the source, a mysterious energy burst destroys the probe and its data. The \\"burst\\" then flies toward Jupiter. The Soviets believe the burst was simply electrostatic build-up, but Floyd suspects it was a warning to stay away from Europa. After surviving a dangerous braking maneuver around Jupiter's upper atmosphere, the Leonov crew find the abandoned Discovery floating in space.

Out of these, Washington, Canada, and Russia have coastlines along the Pacific Ocean, while Ontario does not. 2.

Usage: The task definition provides five key facts - Fact1, Fact2, Fact3, Fact4, and Fact5. These facts are expressed in natural language and will serve as the basis for the story to be generated. Each fact provides a specific detail about the story, such as character names, relationships, settings, or actions. Example: Fact1 - ex-army officer John Henry Brennick and Karen are attempting to cross Canada to have a second child. This fact introduces the protagonists John and Karen and sets the context for their journey. Part #2: Generate a story 100 to 1000 words long. Usage: The story created should be within the specified word count range, ensuring that the resulting narrative is neither too short nor excessively lengthy. Example: The generated story could be a 300-word tale about John and Karen's struggle to protect Karen's unborn child from a cruel government. Part #3: Include all the facts in their order of appearance. Usage: The story must incorporate all five facts provided, maintaining their order of presentation. This requirement ensures that the key elements from the task definition are present and narratively connected throughout the story. Example: The story might start with John and Karen's journey (Fact1), then introduce the threat of the Intestinators (Fact2), followed by John's imprisonment (Fact3), Karen's imprisonment (Fact4), and finally their escape plan (Fact5). Part #4: Expand upon given facts to produce a broader, yet coherent, narrative. Usage: The generated story should not only contain the given facts, but also develop additional elements, characterization, or plotlines that contribute to a more comprehensive and engaging narrative while maintaining coherence. Example: Alongside the given facts, the story could involve a subplot about a group of prisoners plotting to escape, adding depth to the world and tying together the given facts in a more complex and intriguing way. Part #5: Maintain coherence in the narrative. Usage: Though the task involves expanding the narrative by adding new elements, it is essential to maintain coherence throughout the story. The narrative should be logically structured, with each event connected to the others and contributing to an overall unified storyline. Example: As the story unfolds, John, Karen, and the other prisoners' actions should directly or indirectly impact one another, ensuring that each subplot contributes to the main storyline. Furthermore, the story should logically progress from the protagonists' attempts to cross Canada to their fight for freedom within the oppressive prison environment."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

You know she was popular even when she was a child. What was said before this conversation? The answer to this question is:","response":"Given the provided information, we do not have a precise idea about what was said before the conversation started. However, based on the given statement, we can make some educated guesses about the previous conversation. The reference to 'she' and her popularity even from childhood suggests that the prior discussion was about a particular woman. This woman is likely well-known or successful in her present situation since her popularity is brought up. This could mean that she's a celebrity, a public figure, a successful professional, or a prominent person within a certain community or group. Earlier discussions could have revolved around her achievements, her personality traits, her current popularity, or events she had recently been involved in. Perhaps there was a discussion about the reasons for her success or widespread acceptance, leading to someone mentioning that her popularity started during her childhood. Moreover, the tone of the statement (particularly the \\"It's really no surprise\\" part) adds an additional layer of speculation. This could imply that the previous conversation outlined some remarkable accomplishment or feat she achieved, leading to this person pointing out that her success was expected because she had always been popular. So, the prior conversation could have detailed her current situation, her accomplishments, and presumably some sort of reaction or remarks on her ongoing success or popularity.

Question 2: Stephanie McMahon-Given that you have a big TV role in today's WWE as a major main event heel, how much of a say do you have in creative decisions? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are two distinct questions, addressing separate aspects related to two notable wrestling figures, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. Let me provide a detailed answer for each question. Question 1: What is the history of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's relationship? The relationship between Triple H (born Paul Levesque) and Stephanie McMahon (born Stephanie Marie McMahon) stretches back over two decades. Their journey started as a scripted romantic storyline in WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) and has grown into an authentic lifelong partnership both personally and professionally. The roots of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's relationship can be traced back to the late 1990s within the WWE. In 1999, a storyline commenced where Triple H and Stephanie McMahon became an on-screen couple. This included the infamous \\"Vegas Wedding\\" angle in which Triple H drugged and married a seemingly unconscious Stephanie McMahon as part of a rivalry with her father, Vince McMahon. As they continued working together, their on-screen chemistry evolved into a real-life romance. By 2000, the pair had become an influential couple within WWE, joining forces to create the villainous faction known as \\"The McMahon-Helmsley Era.\\" This on-screen partnership continued until 2002 when they \\"divorced\\" as part of the storyline. Despite their on-screen separation, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's real-life relationship continued to flourish. They got engaged in 2003 and were married on October 25, 2003, becoming a power couple both in and out of the ring. Throughout the years, they have supported each other's careers, with Triple H becoming an executive vice president, while Stephanie has risen through the ranks to become the current WWE Chief Brand Officer. They also have an impressive in-ring legacy, with numerous championship belts and accomplishments between them. Beyond the wrestling world, the couple has three daughters and actively participates in various philanthropic and charity ventures. Question 2: Stephanie McMahon-Given that you have a big TV role in today's WWE as a major main event heel, how much of a say do you have in creative decisions? Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, has held numerous executive positions within the company over the years and has been an influential figure in WWE creative decisions. Currently, Stephanie McMahon serves as the WWE Chief Brand Officer, focusing primarily on elevating the brand's image, expanding the company's global reach, and developing strategic partnerships. However, it's essential to recognize that the WWE creative process involves multiple individuals and layers of approval. Although Stephanie plays an on-screen character and carries significant influence as a member of the McMahon family, she doesn't solely dictate the creative content of WWE programming. Instead, the WWE creative team, consisting of writers and producers, develops the creative direction for WWE storylines and character arcs. Ideas usually flow through a chain of command, with input from several individuals, including Stephanie McMahon, Triple H, and ultimately, Vince McMahon, who has the final say in most creative decisions. Despite her primary focus as the Chief Brand Officer and not directly overseeing the creative team, it's clear that Stephanie McMahon, with her deep-rooted connection to the business and on-screen role, would likely have some input and say in creative decisions. Her experience as a performer and WWE executive makes her a valuable resource in offering suggestions and helping to shape the overall direction of storylines and character development."},{"question":"Same meaning?

Would \\"The legislature is seated at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","response":"No, the statement \\"The legislature is seated at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee\\" is not a reasonable answer to your question. This statement merely reveals where the Florida legislature meets, but does not furnish any information about how often it is in session. A more suitable answer to your question is as follows: The frequency of the Florida Legislature's sessions is regulated by the state constitution. Regular sessions commence on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March and last 60 calendar days, which are consecutive unless otherwise provided by law. This means that the Florida Legislature is in session for a total of 60 days every year in a regular session. However, it's important to note that special sessions called by the governor or decided upon by the leadership of both houses may occur. These special sessions can take place at any time of the year and typically address urgent legislative issues that cannot wait until the next regular session. They cannot exceed 20 days, unless extended by a three-fifths vote of each house. Furthermore, the legislature also participates in committee weeks for several months before the regular session. During these committee weeks, legislators meet to discuss, write and pass bills that are then formally introduced during the regular session. These committee weeks typically start in September or October and end when the regular session begins in March. Despite meeting formally for a short period each year, the specific work of the Florida legislature is ongoing throughout the year as they prepare bills, conduct research, analyze budgets, engage with constituents, and participate in interim committee meetings. So, to summarize, while the formal legislative session in Florida happens for 60 consecutive calendar days starting in March each year, the work of the legislature is continuous throughout the year with possible special sessions and committee weeks preceding the regular session."},{"question":"Question: what happens to the light independent reactions of photosynthesis??

Here's a step-by-step justification: Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking what an honest real estate agent would refuse to do in relation to a client. The emphasis is on the agent's honesty. Step 2: Analyze the possible answers - Lie: An honest person, including an honest real estate agent, would not lie. This option is relevant to the agent's honesty. - Deceive: This means to make someone believe something that isn't true. An honest real estate agent would not deceive a client, fitting the idea of honesty. - Hide from: This suggests avoidance rather than dishonesty and may be unrelated to the agent's honesty. - Manipulate: This could mean using tactics to control the client. However, it doesn't necessarily imply honesty or dishonesty and may be less relevant than lying or deceiving. - Charming: This adjective describes someone's personality and doesn't directly relate to honesty or dishonesty. It is not relevant to the question. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the analysis, \\"deceive\\" is the answer most directly related to the honest real estate agent's refusal to engage in dishonest behavior with a client.

Logan had to remind Benjamin to take the medicine because","response":"Benjamin was quite forgetful when it came to his daily routines, especially with something as important as his prescription medications. It wasn't out of sheer negligence, but rather a combination of his busy schedule, numerous responsibilities, and admittedly a bit of absent-mindedness. Logan and Benjamin had been friends since their early years, forging a strong bond like brothers. As they grew older, they continued to support one another through thick and thin. This bond only strengthened when Benjamin fell ill, necessitating a strict medication schedule to keep his condition in check. Logan took it upon himself to be his friend's caretaker and staunch advocate in this trying phase of his life. A sense of protectiveness enveloped Logan, and he was determined to never miss a dose. Consequently, he developed a system to remind Benjamin about the medication he needed. The two would coexist in harmony, with Logan's constant supervision ensuring that Benjamin's well-being was taken care of. Logan's method began with an established morning ritual. Before they would part ways for their respective jobs, he would emphasize to Benjamin the importance of taking his medicine. He would frame these reminders in a light-hearted yet firm manner, knowing that scolding or disappointed tones wouldn't be helpful. This exchange became the centerpiece of their daily interactions, as it was an essential task that Logan hoped would eventually become second nature for Benjamin. Digital reminders also played an important role in Logan's strategy. He would use text messages, phone alarms, and even calendar notifications to ensure Benjamin stayed on track. These digital nudges complimented the habitual morning conversation the duo shared. Over time, Logan realized that it wasn't just the reminders that were crucial, but also creating opportunities for Benjamin to share any apprehensions or concerns about his diagnosis and medications. He gave Benjamin room to express his fears and frustrations when needed, fostering understanding and camaraderie between the two. Logan emphasized the importance of organization when it came to storing Benjamin's medications. A pillbox organizer was purchased, where morning and evening doses were separated and stored in a chronological manner. This way, Benjamin had an easy time remembering which medicine he had taken and which were still pending. In spite of his best efforts, Logan acknowledged that setbacks could still occur. He made sure that an open line of communication existed between the two friends, so that whenever an issue arose, it could be tackled on the spot. He reiterated to Benjamin that missing a single dose wasn't the end of the world, but it was important to strive for consistency. As Logan continued to remind Benjamin to take his medicine, he saw a gradual transformation in his friend's self-discipline. Over time, Benjamin grew more in tune with his body and health, which in turn helped him become more proactive about his condition. The unwavering dedication Logan demonstrated in reminding Benjamin about his medications turned into a pivotal element of their bond. It became a testament to their friendship, proving that through solidarity and compassion, loving friends could endure and conquer life's countless obstacles together."},{"question":"Arena Football League: The year 2000 brought heightened interest in the AFL. Then-St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, who was MVP of Super Bowl XXXIV, was first noticed because he played quarterback for the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with TNN, which, unlike ESPN, televised regular season games live. While it was not financially lucrative, it helped set the stage for what the league would become in the new millennium. Also, the year also brought a spin-off league, the AF2, intended to be a developmental league, comparable to the National Football League's NFL Europe. There was a lot of expansion in the 2000s. Expansion teams included the Austin Wranglers, Carolina Cobras, Los Angeles Avengers, Chicago Rush, Detroit Fury, Dallas Desperados, Colorado Crush, New Orleans VooDoo, Philadelphia Soul, Nashville Kats, Kansas City Brigade, New York Dragons and Utah Blaze. Some of these teams, including the Crush, Desperados, Kats, and VooDoo, were owned by the same group which owned the NFL teams in their host cities.

Yes or no? Answer: They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania . Question: what is a contingent fee with an attorney Answer:","response":"A contingent fee, also known as a contingency fee or no-win, no-fee arrangement, is a payment structure used by attorneys in certain types of legal cases where the attorney's fees are dependent on the outcome of the case. Under this arrangement, an attorney agrees to represent the client on the condition that they will receive payment only if they successfully recover financial compensation or achieve a favorable legal result for the client. In other words, the attorney's fees are contingent upon the successful resolution of the client's case. Contingent fee arrangements are most commonly used in personal injury cases, where the client has suffered harm as a result of another party's negligence or wrongdoing, and is seeking compensation for their injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain, and suffering. This type of fee structure can be beneficial for clients who may not have the financial resources to pay an attorney fee upfront or on an hourly basis. In a typical contingent fee arrangement, the attorney will receive a percentage of any recovery obtained on behalf of the client, whether it be through a settlement, court judgment, or verdict. This percentage can vary, but it generally ranges between 30-40% of the total recovered amount. It is important to note that the attorney will usually bear the responsibility for any costs incurred while working on the case, such as court fees, expert witness fees, and other expenses. However, these costs are then reimbursed from the client's recovery once the case is resolved. A major benefit of the contingent fee system is that it aligns the interests of both the attorney and the client, as the attorney has a vested interest in achieving the best possible outcome for the client. This arrangement also helps to level the playing field for clients who may be unable to afford traditional legal representation, allowing them access to justice and the chance to pursue their claim. However, contingent fee arrangements are not without criticism. Some argue that this system may encourage attorneys to take on risky or weak cases, potentially wasting time, energy, and resources. Others argue that contingent fees can result in attorneys receiving large sums of money after investing relatively little time into a case if it settles quickly. In some jurisdictions, contingent fee arrangements must follow certain legal requirements and restrictions. For example, as you pointed out in your question, contingent fees are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania. In other jurisdictions, such as England and Wales, they are partially regulated under conditional fee agreements or damages-based agreements. It is essential to consult with a knowledgeable attorney to understand the specific requirements and limitations on contingent fees in the applicable jurisdiction. In summary, a contingent fee is a payment arrangement between a client and an attorney where the attorney's fees are dependent on the successful resolution of the client's case. These arrangements can provide clients with limited financial resources with access to justice and representation in cases where they may not have been able to afford it otherwise. However, contingent fees can also be controversial and are subject to regulation and restrictions in some jurisdictions."},{"question":"Agriculture continues to be the dominant economic sector in Indonesia and food security is a major priority.

Translate this to English?","response":"I believe that it is essential to maintain the current milk quota system. Preserving the current milk quota system is crucial for a number of reasons. Firstly, it ensures a stable and predictable supply of milk in the market. This stability is important for both farmers and consumers. For farmers, knowing how much milk they are allowed to produce enables them to plan and manage their resources effectively. They can invest in the necessary infrastructure, feed, and livestock to meet their quotas, and they can predict their income for the year. For consumers, a stable supply of milk means that they can count on this essential product to be readily available in stores at a consistent price. The milk quota system also protects small-scale farmers from market fluctuations and the risk of being undercut by larger, more industrialized competitors. Small farmers might not have the resources to adapt quickly to rapid changes in the market, and sudden increases or decreases in milk prices could put them at a significant disadvantage. The quota system thus helps to maintain a diverse and vibrant farming sector, ensuring that farmers of all sizes can make a living from dairy production. In addition, maintaining a milk quota system also has environmental implications. Without quotas, there could potentially be an increase in milk production, which might contribute to overgrazing, habitat loss, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. By putting a cap on how much milk each farmer can produce, the quota system helps to ensure that dairy farming is carried out in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. This is particularly important in the face of climate change and the need to reduce our environmental impact. Furthermore, the milk quota system can help to avoid overproduction and waste. In the absence of quotas, farmers might be tempted to produce as much milk as possible, which could lead to surplus and potentially wasted milk. This would not only be bad for the environment but also a waste of valuable resources such as water, fertilizers, and energy, which are used in milk production. By setting limits on milk production, the quota system helps to ensure that resources are used efficiently and milk waste is minimized. Lastly, maintaining the current milk quota system allows for better regulation and monitoring of the dairy industry. Quotas enable policymakers to have a clear overview of the industry and track production trends. This information can be used to make informed decisions on pricing, import/export policies, and other dairy-related issues. Additionally, enforcing quotas can help keep illegal practices in check, such as producing milk beyond the allowed quotas or using hormones to increase milk yield. In conclusion, it is crucial to maintain the current milk quota system to ensure a stable and predictable supply of milk, support small-scale farmers, promote environmental sustainability, prevent overproduction and waste, and allow for better regulation of the dairy industry."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: It's seven fifty in the morning .

If one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider - has Ritchie been found out? Is he really that talented? Does he really have any genuine original ideas? Or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap? After watching Revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? What happened to his great sense of humour? Where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? Revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and succinct, it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. However, in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. Its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. So what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces. Revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It aims high, but inevitably shots blanks aplenty. Revolver deserves to be lambasted, it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur.

The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. I am facing a new situation today: Two bird islands experienced different levels of rainfall. West island experienced a lengthy drought that lasted several years. Many birds were affected by this drought. East island had several normal years as far as rainfall was concerned. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island had fewer birds with smaller beaks die in the drought? Answer:","response":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article and the new situation presented, the correct answer to the question would be: East Island had fewer birds with smaller beaks die in the drought. This conclusion can be reached through the following reasoning: 1. In the background article, it was observed that during a period of very low rainfall (drought conditions), finches with smaller beaks struggled to find enough food, as they could only eat smaller seeds. This led to the death of many small-beaked birds. 2. On the other hand, finches with larger beaks were better off, as they could eat seeds of all sizes. Consequently, they had higher survival and reproduction rates. This ultimately resulted in an increase in the average beak size among the finch population, which is an example of evolution by natural selection. 3. In the new situation, West Island experienced a lengthy drought, while East Island had normal rainfall. Since a drought is known to have adverse effects on the survival of small-beaked birds, we can infer that such birds suffered more on West Island than on East Island. 4. Therefore, considering the conditions in the new situation, fewer birds with smaller beaks would have died on East Island, as it did not experience the drought that contributed to the decline in small-beaked bird populations."},{"question":"Generate a positive review for a place.","response":"Step 1: Choose the place for which the positive review will be written.

They are responsible for participating in dialogues, initiating reforms, and implementing policies that contribute to enhancing the adaptability of the labor market. As they acknowledge the importance of striking a balance between flexibility and security, they are in a position to drive positive change and ensure that the labor market remains robust and capable of responding to fluctuations in demand and supply. However, it seems that in the current scenario, there is a lack of new initiatives to address the challenges posed by the adaptability pillar. It would be advisable for all stakeholders to come together and brainstorm ideas to improve the overall adaptability of the labor market. Some possible measures could include: 1. Enhancing the quality of education and training systems, so that individuals are well-equipped with the skills necessary to perform in various job roles and can easily switch between different occupations as the market evolves. 2. Fostering an environment that promotes lifelong learning, wherein individuals are encouraged to continually upgrade their skills and knowledge, making them more adaptable to changing market conditions. 3. Encouraging the development of innovative business models and flexible working arrangements, such as remote work and flexible hours, which can help foster greater adaptability in the face of market shifts and technological advancements. 4. Providing a clear and predictable legal framework that lays out the rights and obligations of employers and employees in various types of employment relationships, so as to maintain stability and security. 5. Strengthening the role of social partners in the development and implementation of labor market policies, so as to ensure that adaptability is taken into account in these decisions. In conclusion, the adaptability pillar is crucial for maintaining a balance between flexibility and security. Although social partners recognize its importance, there seems to be a dearth of new initiatives in this area. It is essential for all stakeholders to collaborate and devise strategies to address the issue of adaptability, as this will significantly contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the labor market as it faces unprecedented challenges in the future."},{"question":"\\" \\" No its ok its not\\"lol .

Article: Holidays are really important. Many of us will have childhood memories of summer holidays where we were taken away from home to experience new environments and learn in different ways. But holidays are expensive and, for those on low wages or living on benefits, they are often unobtainable. Even the cheapest holidays require travel and other additional costs that are difficult for many families to meet. For working parents, the long summer break can be a very difficult problem for childcare. When an annual leave allowance amounts to only five weeks, there is a need to spread this across the year. Couples can find themselves taking leave in turn in order to care for children who are on holiday. For some this makes even an affordable family holiday difficult. The schools that I visit in Nottingham are full of experienced staff committed to giving our children a caring and inspiring learning environment. The number of children receiving free school meals is quite large in Nottingham and many schools have breakfast clubs to make sure that children get a healthy start to the day. Most schools undertake programs of group or individual educational support. Schools also have an important role in safeguarding children's welfare through the ongoing touch and support with their pupils. During the long summer holidays, much of this is missed. While teachers are holidaying in the UK, many of their pupils spend the whole six weeks on the street where they live. The lack of free school meals for six weeks can result in pressure on a family budget and an inability to afford the inspiring experiences that help children to continue their learning. In setting out its plans for a five-term year, Nottingham City Council is seeking to reduce the summer holiday down to four and a half weeks, with a more balanced five terms of roughly eight weeks, each followed by a two-week break. We believe this will give real \\"down time\\" for school staff and pupils alike but will be short enough not to cause a real break in learning. We... Question: The passage is probably written by _ .

Sister Mary Bonaventure is in charge of the hospital ward of a convent in the county of Norfolk, England. She is troubled by her own sister's suicide, which she confides to her Mother Superior. A torrential rain closes nearby roads, causing Sergeant Melling of the police to bring condemned murderer Valerie Carns there. She is being taken to prison. Valerie was convicted of poisoning her brother Jason, a pianist. Jason's physician, Dr. Jeffreys, is head of the hospital where Sister Mary now works. Valerie still proclaims her innocence, but Jeffreys insists that she gave Jason a fatal overdose of his medicine. A photograph of Jason clearly disturbs Isabel Jeffreys, the doctor's wife. He gives her a sedative. Valerie appeals to Sister Mary to bring her fiance, Sidney Kingham, to the convent to see her. A servant tells Sister Mary about the sadistic behavior of Jason Carns and produces a love letter to him, clearly written by Isabel. Mother Superior is upset by Sister Mary's meddling. She burns the letter. The nun still intends to tell Melling the police sergeant what she knows. Dr. Jeffreys is the one who gave Jason the fatal dose, and he might be slowly poisoning Isabel as well. He lures Sister Mary to a bell tower, where he attacks her. She rings the bell. Sidney hears it, rushes to her aid and overpowers Jeffreys, who is arrested by Melling. Sister Mary's faith is restored, believing the rain that delivered Valerie to her to be divine intervention.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are Strong or Weak ): When you hold two magnets far away what is the force between them Strong or Weak? Answer:","response":"Answer: Weak When you hold two magnets far away from each other, the force between them is weak. This is because magnetic force follows an inverse-square law. As the distance between the objects (in this case, the magnets) increases, the magnetic force of attraction decreases rapidly. The inverse-square law states that the intensity of a physical quantity (like magnetic force) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. In mathematical terms, it is represented as: F ∝ 1 / d^2, where F is the magnetic force between the magnets and d is the distance between them. According to this formula, when d increases, F decreases. This means that when the distance between the magnets is larger, the force of attraction (or repulsion) between them becomes weaker. Conversely, when the magnets are brought closer together, the magnetic force becomes stronger. It's essential to note that the exact strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on other factors, too, including the strength of the magnets themselves (measured in units like Gauss or Tesla), their size and shape, and the materials they are composed of. However, given the information provided in the passage and considering the inverse-square law of magnetic forces, the correct answer to the question is that the force between two magnets held far away from each other is weak."},{"question":"John Halsey (born 23 February 1945 in Highgate) is a rock drummer, best known for his appearance as Barrington Womble (\\"Barry Wom\\") in The Rutles, leading to his playing with Neil Innes's band Fatso and appearing in the television film \\"All You Need is Cash\\" (1978).

Halfway home, I noticed my 7-year-old son playing with a plastic noisemaker. Long story short: He had stolen the toy. I kept my cool -- even when he said, \\"but it was only 1.50, Mom!\\" --and explained why it was unacceptable to take things we didn't buy. A few hours later, I marched my son back to the store with two dollars from his piggy bank. He walked embarrassedly to the counter and told the clerk that he had taken something without paying for it, that he was sorry to break it and that he would pay for it now. I know exactly how terrible he was feeling. Returning to the scene of the crime is the same shame-causing punishment I received when I was five and stole something from a store. 1 remember my dad sending me back to return the item. It remains one of my clearest child- hood memories. After that day, I never stole again. My dad taught me such an important lesson 30 years ago and I saw an opportunity to do the same for my son. But now I wonder if it was the fight thing to do. \\"Returning to the store is absolutely the right thing to do,\\" Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist and author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids, says. \\"Many children steal -- they' re not born knowing the rules so it' s our job to teach them.\\" And stay calm when you set them. \\"If you overreact or yell, you might create a fascination with the behavior and a willful child will be more likely to fight against you,\\" she says. Having a child physically return the stolen item helps him or her grasp the situation -- and the consequence. But don't talk about it for too long. \\"lf you continuously bring up the incident, the child will believe they' re a thief and that they' re bad,\\" she says. Only time will tell if this experience will have the same powerful effect on my son as it had on me, but at the same time I can rest if I haven' t dealt with the situation badly. Question: When the author' s son was caught playing with a stolen toy, he _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"didn't think it was a big deal\\"? Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer is \\"didn't think it was a big deal.\\" When the author's son was caught playing with the stolen toy, he initially tried to downplay the situation by saying, \\"but it was only 1.50, Mom!\\" This response suggests that he didn't think it was a big deal or a significant problem. However, the author used the opportunity to teach their son an important lesson about stealing and its consequences. The fact that the son was made to return the stolen item to the store and apologize for his actions helps him understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of abiding by societal rules and norms. Additionally, according to Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist, intervening in such a situation is crucial to developing a child's understanding of right from wrong. Parents should remain calm and composed while handling the situation to prevent the child from becoming more fascinated by or defiant against the behavior. It's important not to overemphasize the incident or continuously bring it up to avoid the child developing a negative self-image or believing they are inherently bad. In the end, only time will tell if this experience has the same powerful, transformative effect on the author's son as it had on the author themselves. But by taking the appropriate steps to address the situation and communicate the importance of respecting property and ownership, the author can feel confident they didn't handle the situation badly."},{"question":"Write a text based on \\"suriname government minister denies corruption allegations\\" Text:","response":"Title: Suriname's Government Minister Firmly Refutes Corruption Accusations The recent turmoil caused by corruption allegations against a top-ranking government minister in Suriname has taken a new turn, as the minister in question stands firm in denying any involvement in corrupt activities. The nation of Suriname, located in northeastern South America, has witnessed its fair share of scandals related to corruption in the past. However, this incident has drawn significant attention from the international community, putting the Surinamese government's integrity further into question. The allegations surfaced following reports of suspicious financial transactions and the misuse of public funds for personal enrichment. According to multiple sources, the minister, whom the authorities have not officially named, has been involved in the inappropriate diversion of funds meant for public projects and the inappropriate granting of contracts to businesses with close ties to the minister. Upon hearing these accusations, the minister at the center of the controversy immediately took action to issue a staunch denial of any wrongdoing. In an official statement made to the press, the minister highlighted their long-standing commitment to public service and stated unequivocally that they had never engaged in corrupt practices. The minister emphasized that they have always worked for the welfare of Suriname and its people, and they are committed to promoting transparency and good governance. The minister's denial of these allegations has generated mixed reactions from the public, with supporters expressing confidence in the minister's integrity and detractors claiming that the allegations are an indication of a wider issue within the Surinamese political landscape. In response to these divergent opinions, the Surinamese government has vowed to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into the matter. As part of its efforts to address the issue, the government has requested the assistance of international experts to ensure that the inquiry maintains the highest standards of transparency and objectivity. The government has acknowledged that incidents of corruption can threaten the trust of the people in their institutions, and hence they are taking the utmost care to establish the truth and, if necessary, take appropriate legal action. Furthermore, the government called upon the public to remain vigilant and actively denounce any instances of corruption they may encounter. By involving the citizens in its efforts to combat corruption, the Surinamese government aims to foster a culture of accountability and responsibility, which can help to rebuild trust in political institutions. In conclusion, the alleged corruption scandal involving a prominent government minister in Suriname has gained significant attention and fueled public debate surrounding the issue of improprieties within the nation's political system. While the minister concerned has issued a firm denial, the government has taken measures to ensure the allegations are investigated thoroughly and in an unbiased manner. By doing so, they aim not only to address the current controversy but also to create an environment of transparency and integrity within the Surinamese political landscape. The outcome of this investigation will undoubtedly have lasting effects on the future of good governance in Suriname and serve as a touchstone for how the nation deals with corruption in the years to come."},{"question":"\\"La-La (Means I Love You)\\" is an R&B / soul song by American vocal group The Delfonics.

Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Ohio State Buckeyes are the athletic teams that represent The Ohio State University, named after the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

This is the English translation of the phrase \\"La eutanasia significa una muerte buena.\\" Euthanasia is a term derived from the Greek words \\"eu\\" (good) and \\"thanatos\\" (death), and it generally refers to the practice of intentionally ending an individual's life to alleviate their suffering and pain. This practice can be controversial and is subject to various ethical, moral, and legal debates. There are different forms of euthanasia, such as passive euthanasia, where medical treatment is withheld or withdrawn to let the person die naturally, and active euthanasia, where a deliberate action is taken to end the individual's life, often through a lethal injection. The concept of euthanasia also encompasses other terms, such as assisted suicide, which involves helping someone take their own life or providing the means to do so. The legality and acceptance of euthanasia can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction and cultural context. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium, have legalized certain forms of euthanasia, whereas others, such as the United States, have varying state laws and generally do not allow for active euthanasia but may permit certain passive euthanasia practices under specific conditions. Additionally, it is essential to consider the individual's perspective and preferences, family members' opinions, and the healthcare provider's professional judgment and ethical obligations when making decisions about euthanasia."},{"question":"Write an article with the title: \\"Financial Futures - washingtonpost.com\\"","response":"Title: Financial Futures - washingtonpost.com Introduction: Financial futures have become an integral part of the global financial market, as investors look for ways to manage risk, secure assets, and speculate on market changes. In an effort to educate our readers on the intricacies of these financial instruments, we will explore how financial futures work, their key benefits, and their possible risks. Key players, such as banks, corporations, and individual investors, use futures to hedge against potential losses, ensuring a stable financial foundation for their various endeavors. This article will delve deeper into the intricate world of financial futures, their impact on the global markets, and their ever-evolving nature. Understanding Financial Futures: A financial future refers to a legal agreement between two parties to buy or sell a financial asset at a predetermined price on a specific date in the future. These assets can include stocks, bonds, currencies, or other financial instruments. By locking in a price today, market participants can reduce uncertainty, mitigate risk, and engage in speculative trading. Financial futures are traded in standardized contracts on organized exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), ensuring transparency, liquidity, and regulatory oversight. Traders can opt to take long positions (buying futures contracts with the expectation that the asset's value will increase) or short positions (selling futures contracts to profit from an anticipated decline in the asset's value). Benefits of Financial Futures: 1. Risk Management: By locking in prices for future transactions, companies and investors can mitigate the risks associated with market fluctuations. For example, importers and exporters can use currency futures to hedge against exchange rate movements, and producers can lock in prices for commodities to protect against price surges or drops. 2. Leverage: Futures trading allows investors to control larger positions with relatively small amounts of capital, offering the potential for greater profits. However, it is essential to understand that this leverage also increases the level of risk. 3. Diversification: Investors can diversify their portfolios by trading in various financial futures markets, including equities, bonds, or currencies. By spreading risk across different assets, market participants can reduce the impact of a single investment on their overall financial health. 4. Speculation: Traders can use financial futures to speculate on market trends and price movements, earning potential profits if their assessments are correct. Such speculation drives liquidity within the market, ensuring that there is always a willing buyer or seller for each trade. Risks Associated with Financial Futures: 1. Leverage Risks: While the leverage associated with futures trading can lead to significant profits, it also increases the potential for losses. For this reason, investors must fully understand their positions and utilize risk management tools like stop-loss orders to protect their capital. 2. Market Volatility: Financial markets are inherently unpredictable, and sudden shifts can quickly impact futures prices. Being well-informed on market trends and closely monitoring positions can help investors navigate these uncertainties. 3. Counterparty Risk: Although standardized contracts and organized exchanges reduce counterparty risk, there is still a possibility that the party on the other side of the transaction may default on their obligations. Exchange-traded futures, however, are subject to strict regulations and have a reduced counterparty risk compared to over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Conclusion: Financial futures play a crucial role in the modern global economy by providing market participants with valuable tools to manage risks and seize opportunities. As sophisticated financial instruments, they offer the potential for substantial rewards but also carry various risks. Investors interested in trading financial futures must develop a deep understanding of market dynamics, utilize effective risk management strategies and actively monitor their positions. By doing so, they can take advantage of the numerous benefits these instruments offer and propel their financial future to new heights."},{"question":"Facts: - death date: 9 may 1921 - birth date: 21 july 1857 - name: peter townsend barlow - death place: chicago , illinois , united states - birth place: new york city , new york , united states - occupation: lawyer and new york city magistrate Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of peter townsend barlow .

Answer the above question based on the context below: Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz' African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell.

That's down from 6.19% in the period last year, and below the 6.01% delinquency rate for the last three months of 2011. The decline in the U.S. mortgage delinquency rate follows two quarters of increases. But barring any severe shocks to the U.S. economy, the rate is expected to continue easing, says Tim Martin, group vice president of U.S. Housing for TransUnion. \\"We had a couple quarters where it ticked up, so it's nice to see it come back down,\\" Martin said. \\"That should be what happens the rest of the year, so we're hopefully on the path of improvement now.\\" TransUnion's analysis is derived from a sample of 10% of U.S. mortgage holders. Before the housing bust, mortgage delinquencies were running at less than 2% nationally. It took about three years after the housing market crashed for the delinquency rate on mortgages to climb to a peak of nearly 7% in the fourth quarter 2009. The rate has been trending down since then. Seasonal patterns — such as homeowners skipping payments to spend money elsewhere in the last three months of the year — were likely a factor in the uptick last fall. Still, the national delinquency rate remains well above its historical range, an indication many homeowners are still struggling five years after the housing downturn. \\"It's coming down a lot more slowly than it went back up,\\" Martin said. The delinquency rate won't likely get back down to its normal 2% level until housing prices recover. Home prices dropped in February in most major U.S. cities for a sixth-straight month, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home-price index. Still, there have been some bright spots in housing and economic trends this year that could point to further improvement in the mortgage delinquency rate. The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point since August to 8.1% last month — lowest since January 2009. Hiring has strengthened, despite posting weaker-than-anticipated gains in March and April. And the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first quarter, aided by stronger consumer spending. And while sales of previously owned homes fell in March, a mild winter drove gains in January and February, making this year's winter the best for home sales in five years. As long as the economy, housing market and jobs outlook continue to improve, it's likely fewer homeowners will fall behind on their mortgage payments, Martin said. Another factor: Loans made between 2008 and 2011, after the housing crisis began, have a lower delinquency rate than older loans. \\"As time goes on, they become a bigger and bigger percentage of the total, so that helps bring the rates down as well,\\" Martin said. All but eight states saw their mortgage delinquency rate decline in the first quarter vs. the last three months of last year: Montana, Hawaii, Maine, North Dakota, New York, Maryland, Washington and Delaware. Florida led the nation with the highest mortgage delinquency rate 13.87%, down from 14.27% in the fourth quarter last year. The Sunshine State wasn't the only foreclosure hotbed where mortgage delinquency improved in the first quarter.

Based on the premise, we can analyze different components and compare them with the hypothesis to determine if the hypothesis is true. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis into their individual components and compare them: 1. \\"A balding professor\\": In the premise, the subject is described as a balding professor, which means the professor is experiencing hair loss. In the hypothesis, the subject is described as a professor with no hair, which means the professor has already lost all his hair. In both cases, the primary subject is a professor who has hair loss issues, but the degree of hair loss is different. 2. \\"Giving a lecture to students\\": Both the premise and hypothesis contain this component in which the professor is delivering a lecture to students. The act of lecturing is common in both, suggesting that this part of the hypothesis aligns with the premise. 3. \\"On the topic of 'opportunity'\\": The premise mentions a specific topic for the lecture: opportunity. This detail is omitted from the hypothesis, which does not mention the subject matter. By analyzing these components, we can say that the hypothesis is partially true, but not entirely accurate compared to the premise. The hypothesis accurately captures that the lecturer is a professor who is giving a lecture to students, but it does not mention the topic of the lecture. Additionally, instead of describing the professor as balding, the hypothesis refers to a professor with no hair, which is a different degree of hair loss. Overall, the hypothesis captures some of the points from the premise, but there are differences in the context of hair loss and the omission of the lecture topic. Therefore, while the hypothesis is not entirely false, it does not completely align with the premise."},{"question":"Question: \\"The Numero Group\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Justification: Thoughts play an integral role in shaping our reality, both at an individual and societal level. The concept of thoughts affecting reality stems from the idea that our perception of reality is largely influenced by our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. The human mind processes information and builds a subjective reality influenced by personal interpretations, experiences, and interactions with the environment. At the individual level, one's mental and emotional well-being is significantly influenced by their thoughts. The cognitive approach to understanding behavior emphasizes that our thoughts guide our emotions and actions. For instance, positive thinking has been shown to improve mental health as it encourages self-confidence, motivation, and resilience in the face of challenges. On the other hand, negative thoughts can lead to unhealthy patterns of behavior, such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Moreover, the power of thoughts extends to interpersonal relationships and communication. People who hold optimistic and empathetic thoughts are more likely to form meaningful connections with others, fostering positive, supportive relationships that contribute to overall well-being. Conversely, those with negative thought patterns may struggle with social interactions and difficulties building strong, lasting relationships. At the societal level, the collective thoughts of the population greatly contribute to the progress and direction of society. Throughout history, innovative thinkers have generated groundbreaking ideas that shaped the trajectory of science, culture, politics, and technology. The accumulative power of thoughts, therefore, is vital in driving societal growth and solving complex problems. In conclusion, thoughts play a crucial role in shaping reality for both individuals and society as a whole. A positive outlook significantly influences mental and emotional well-being, leading to healthy relationships and personal growth. At a larger scale, innovative thoughts pave the way for societal progress, transforming our collective reality for the better."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Horrible Bosses 'Horrible Bosses' review: Cheerfully outrageous killer comedy John P. Johnson/AP Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis star in 'Horrible Bosses.' Comedy about three buddies who plan to kill their supervisors. With Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston. Director: Seth Gordon. (1:40). R: language, violence, sexuality. At area theaters. All those who have to drag themselves to work every morning will surely find some comfort in Seth Gordon's cheerfully outrageous revenge comedy, \\"Horrible Bosses.\\" Gordon, who made the terrific documentary \\"The King of Kong,\\" is still a little wobbly when it comes to fiction. Fortunately, his outstanding cast steadies all but the most uneven moments. Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day) are best friends who meet each night to unload their miseries. Nick is perpetually humiliated by his monstrous CEO (Kevin Spacey), Dale is being sexually harassed by the dentist he assists (Jennifer Aniston), and Kurt works for a drug-addled, wannabe playboy (an amusingly unrecognizable Colin Farrell). Soon, what begins as a fantasy nurtured over happy hour turns into tempting reality: could they possibly off their bosses? Deciding each should meet with a fatal \\"accident,\\" the guys plan the perfect crime . . . and then fail dramatically every step along the way. Once they set up their promising premise, the three screenwriters don't quite know where to go. So too often, they wander aimlessly, hoping the actors will pick up the slack. And, remarkably enough, they do. Bateman—surely the best comic foil around--proves most invaluable; Day (\\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\") expands on his loose cannon persona, while Sudeikis refines his deadpan flakiness. All the actors have their moments, though, including the supporting players. Even Aniston commits fully to a truly thankless role; surely there are better ways to shed her good-girl image than by desperately molesting the whiny Day. Still, it's pretty clear that the \\"Horrible Bosses\\" set was a great place to work: everyone seems to be having a blast. If that's more than you can say about your own office, sneak out to see this during an extra-long lunch--their good time should make your work day a little easier to bear. Just don't come back with any bright ideas, okay? Magic Moment: A scene-stealing Jamie Foxx offers some priceless advice as an assassination \\"consultant.\\" ||||| On-the-job training of would-be murderers By Michael O'Sullivan Friday, July 8, 2011 It had to happen. With the arrival of “Horrible Bosses,” the recession-themed comedy is now an official summer trend. (See the layoff-centric “Larry Crowne” and “Everything Must Go,” which center on Tom Hanks and Will Ferrell, respectively, losing their jobs. Never mind that “Everything” is technically a dramedy. Two words: Will Ferrell.) This scorchingly raunchy — and yes, pretty funny — movie is built around the premise that three buddies (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day) would rather murder their evil overseers than simply quit and look for new jobs. Why? Because there are no other jobs out there. One brief, early scene makes that clear, by comparing the unhappy trio to another guy friend (P.J. Byrne) who, after two years of unemployment, has been reduced to hustling gay sex in bars. Look, I told you it was raunchy. If the sweetly gentle, almost naive rom-com “Larry Crowne” is from Venus, then the testosterone-crazed “Horrible Bosses” is from Mars. Or maybe Uranus. (Yes, it’s that far out there.) In one memorable scene, Sudeikis’s Kurt inserts a toothbrush and other oral-care products belonging to his boss into one of his bodily orifices in an attempt to poison — or maybe just gross out — the guy. Sporting a greasy comb-over, an almost-unrecognizable Colin Farrell plays that coked-out victim-in-waiting. The Irish actor has a field day with the role. When he orders Kurt to “trim the fat” in the office, he really means “fire the fat people.” Kevin Spacey is equally over the top as Harken, the smarmily psychopathic tormentor to Bateman’s Nick, a psychologically emasculated yes man who has waited eight years for a promotion, only to see Harken take the job for himself. The most horrible of the horrible bosses, Harken is a real pleasure, especially when he gets his comeuppance. Jennifer Aniston, however, has the most memorable turn on the side of mismanagement, playing against the actress’s sweetheart reputation as a foulmouthed, sexually aggressive dentist for whom Day’s Dale works as a hygienist. She would be a walking harassment lawsuit — if not an open-and-shut case of attempted rape — except that Dale, who’s happily engaged to someone else (Lindsay Sloane), really, really needs the job, and hence must keep his mouth shut. Technically, he’s a convicted sex offender himself, having been arrested for urinating in an empty playground, in the middle of the night. His situation, in which he merely has to put up with a hot, predatory supervisor, “doesn’t sound that bad,” according to Kurt. Still, the three friends decide to go in together on a murder plot, seeking advice from a shady consultant they meet in a bar (Jamie Foxx). It’s a fun cameo, if only for the character’s uproariously unprintable nickname. Hilarity — or at least filth — ensues. While the movie has plenty of hearty laughs, and precious little downtime, it is at moments swamped by its own sophomoric masculinity. Kurt, for example, is a horndog of the first order, almost derailing the trio’s plans by first seducing Dale’s boss, then Harken’s wife (Julie Bowen). And the running joke of the Aniston-Day subplot — premised on the absurdity of anyone in her right mind finding Charlie Day irresistible — is a shameless adolescent male fantasy. It’s Van Halen’s “Hot for Teacher” video, presented as deadpan documentary, which makes it all the funnier. Interestingly, director Seth Gordon first gained notice with his 2007 documentary “The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters,” which looked at overgrown adolescent males obsessed with the Donkey Kong video game. There’s an underlying, nearly universal relatability to “Horrible Bosses” that can’t be denied and that screenwriters Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein use to great advantage. When Nick fantasizes about tackling Harken, dragging him by the tie, and throwing him out the window of their office high-rise, I jotted down these words: “We’ve all been there.” [Note to editor: I’m not talking about you.] And as far the frustrated worker-bee humor is concerned, we have all been there, men and women alike. When it comes to some of the more snickering, boy’s club comedy, however, it does help to have a Y chromosome. Contains prolific obscenity, crude and sexual humor, drug use and some violence. ||||| Horrible Bosses (2011) It requires no great critical insight to figure out what’s wrong with “ Horrible Bosses ,” a foul-mouthed new comedy of male resentment directed by Seth Gordon . The problems can be enumerated with a prim scowl and a wagging finger. The movie, in addition to being expectedly vulgar, is noisy and preposterous, and its humor flirts with racism, goes steady with misogyny and pretty much marries homophobia. There are guns, drugs, several references to sex acts involving urine, and gross insults — unless they are extravagant compliments; I’ll get back to you — to the respected profession of dentistry. So here is the evident puzzle: “Horrible Bosses” is also frequently very funny. One reason is that it does not bother to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability. Nor, however, does it make a big show of being provocative, of pretending that its forays into offensiveness are acts of bravery. It takes the ordinary human traits of stupidity, selfishness, lust and greed (and also stupidity), embeds them in a human condition that is confusing, unfair and also stupid, and turns the whole sorry spectacle into a carnival. The laughter is mean but also oddly pure: it expels shame and leaves you feeling dizzy, a little embarrassed and also exhilarated, kind of like the cocaine that two of the main characters consume by accident. The scene of their hapless nose-candy binge exemplifies this movie’s spirit. On the one hand, the guys — Dale (Charlie Day) and Nick (Jason Bateman), along with their friend Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) — have broken into a house to do a little recon for one of three murders they plan to commit. This is a bad thing to do. On the other hand, there is something endearing about their utter hysterical ineptness, and their excursion into vice and criminality seems as innocent as it is desperate. The desperation allows “Horrible Bosses” to graze ever so lightly against some unpleasant social realities and to find a glimmer of class consciousness in an avalanche of crude gaggery. Dale, Nick and Kurt are all stuck in terrible jobs, at the mercy of employers whose power is absolute and arbitrary. “I own you,” says Mr. Harken, Nick’s smug, sadistic boss, played by — one guess! — Kevin Spacey with all the lethal smarm he brought to “Swimming With Sharks” and more. Sure, it’s an easy bit of casting, but so is Colin Farrell as a twitchy, amoral playboy and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy dentist. I mean a sexually predatory dentist, though the distinction is lost on Kurt, who thinks she’s hot. But he doesn’t work for her. Dale does, and her constant barrage of innuendo and solicitation — she’s as subtle as a plumber making a house call in a porn film — makes him uncomfortable. The sheer tastelessness of this situation is what makes it work, coupled with its almost surreal improbability. Dale, in addition to being a devoted almost-husband (his briefly glimpsed fiancée is played by Lindsay Sloane) is a ball of rodentlike, idiotic nervous energy. He’s the designated annoying-dimwit-friend, Zach Galifianakis shrunk down to Gilbert Gottfried size. As his pals, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Sudeikis do not exactly break ground. Mr. Bateman is uptight, anxious and asexual, firing darts of weary sarcasm with his eyes, while Mr. Sudeikis is a genial, excitable doofus who also happens to be catnip for the ladies. At least the two ladies with substantial speaking roles — Ms. Aniston and Julie Bowen, who should have more and better things to do. But to go further on this theme would ruin a few jokes, as well as leading me back toward the sour, complaining tone of the first paragraph. The sexual politics of “Horrible Bosses” are less obnoxiously retrograde than those of, oh, “The Hangover: Part II,” partly because of Ms. Aniston’s comic skill and partly because they are beside the point. To extent that there is a point, beyond sheer silliness — which is fine on its own, by the way — it has something to do with the unfairness of work at a time of high unemployment, when everything seems to be tilted in favor of those who already have power. Harken teases Nick with a phantom promotion, making a cruel game of his underling’s modest ambitions. Mr. Farrell’s feckless character, who inherits the company where Kurt works, is a monster of irresponsibility. Dale is subjected to escalating harassment and blackmail. These predicaments are as exaggerated as the bumbling homicidal response they inspire, but then again, in times like these, what are abused and humiliated workers going to do? Join a union? Go to court? That would be a different movie. This one is content to make a show of the kind of skills that are unlikely to get anyone very far in the workplace but that are nonetheless essential to the functions of farce. The verbal humor is more a matter of riffing than of delivering neatly defined jokes, but the timing of the cast — notably including Jamie Foxx, as well as the others already mentioned — is impeccable. And Mr. Gordon and the writers, Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, allow the hilarity to build, escalate and swerve off course. You are in the hands of professionals, which means that, in the ways that count and even when it shouldn’t, “Horrible Bosses” works. “Horrible Bosses” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Mostly talk, of the kind that would get you (or at least me) in a lot of trouble at work. HORRIBLE BOSSES Opens on Friday nationwide. Directed by Seth Gordon; written by Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, based on a story by Mr. Markowitz; director of photography, David Hennings; edited by Peter Teschner; music by Christopher Lennertz; production design by Shepherd Frankel; costumes by Carol Ramsey; produced by Brett Ratner and Jay Stern; released by Warner Brothers Pictures.

The audience first sees her attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passerby gives her his handkerchief and offers to take her to a hospital. She refuses, makes up a boyfriend story and asks for some money. She sends him the money back with a thank you note and a new handkerchief. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake. Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy. After the movie, Liz talks to the audience about her son, whom she clearly loves, though he's now in foster care. She finally gets a customer and services him. He has a heart...

Premise: \\"Styles is really a glorious old place, I said to John.\\" - This premise states that the speaker is expressing their opinion to John. - The opinion being conveyed is that the speaker considers Styles, presumably a location or manor, to be a glorious old place. Hypothesis: \\"I told John that I considered Styles and its manor a glorious place.\\" - This hypothesis states that the speaker communicates to John that they find Styles and its manor to be a glorious place. - It is a rephrased account of the speaker's opinion expressed in the premise. Step 1: Identify the main points of the premise and hypothesis. Premise: 1. The speaker is talking to John. 2. The speaker considers Styles to be a glorious old place. Hypothesis: 1. The speaker communicates their thoughts to John. 2. The speaker considers Styles and its manor to be a glorious place. Step 2: Compare the main points in the premise and hypothesis. 1. Both the premise and hypothesis have the speaker expressing their opinion to John. 2. Both the premise and hypothesis show that the speaker considers Styles to be a glorious place. However, there is a slight difference in the details provided about Styles. In the premise, the speaker mentions Styles as a \\"glorious old place.\\" In the hypothesis, the speaker mentions Styles and its manor as being a \\"glorious place.\\" The distinction here is the addition of \\"its manor\\" and the removal of \\"old\\" from the hypothesis. Step 3: Determine whether the difference alters the entailment. While there is a slight difference in the description of Styles, the hypothesis still captures the central idea of the speaker calling Styles a glorious place. The minor differences do not significantly alter the meaning and overall intent of the statement. Therefore, based on this analysis, the premise does entail the hypothesis \\"I told John that I considered Styles and its manor a glorious place.\\" The central ideas of both statements are aligned, despite the slight variation in the description of Styles."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: What is 2003 MLS All-Star Game connection to StubHub?","response":"The 2003 Major League Soccer (MLS) All-Star Game doesn't have a direct connection to StubHub in terms of involvement in the planning or execution of the event.

This kind of connection is not exclusive to the 2003 MLS All-Star Game but applies to virtually any event, including games from other years and different sports events, concerts, etc. As StubHub was founded in 2000, it is entirely plausible that tickets for the 2003 MLS All-Star Game were bought and sold through that platform.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as..., can you guess it ?

Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: \\"Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life.\\" Baker has described Schwarzenegger as \\"[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic\\" but claims towards the end of the relationship he became \\"insufferable – classically conceited – the world revolved around him\\". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard.

Answer:","response":"The last step of the process is the occurrence of an earthquake. The seismic waves generated by the release of energy from the crumbling rocks and movement along the cracks, or fault lines, propagate through the Earth's crust. These waves can cause the ground to shake, resulting in the phenomenon we know as an earthquake. When the seismic waves reach the Earth's surface, they can cause significant damage to natural landscapes, human infrastructures, and even alter the environment in the vicinity of the fault line. The intensity of the shaking and the resulting damage can vary greatly depending on factors such as the amount of built-up stress released, the depth at which the cracks have formed and the movement occurred, the type of rocks and soil present in the area, and the population density in the region affected by the earthquake. In some instances, secondary hazards can also arise from earthquakes. For example, the shaking can trigger landslides and soil liquefaction, which can lead to further destruction of infrastructure and loss of life. Moreover, if the faults are located underwater or near a coastline, the movement of the Earth's crust could generate tsunamis, which are massive ocean waves that can cause widespread devastation upon reaching the shore. After an earthquake occurs, rescue and recovery efforts usually follow. These efforts may involve searching for and rescuing trapped individuals, providing medical assistance to the injured, assessing and repairing damaged infrastructures, and implementing rebuilding or relocation plans. Scientists and seismologists also continue to analyze the geological data from the earthquake to understand the processes that led to the event and develop methods to mitigate the impacts of future seismic activity."},{"question":"There are 5 chess amateurs playing in Villa's chess club tournament.

The marbles moved in all directions when the siblings played with them on a plastic table instead. The marbles moved on the plastic table instead of the bedspread because the plastic table provided (A) more friction (B) less friction. Choose the answer between \\"bedspread\\" and \\"plastic table\\". The answer to this question is:","response":"The answer to this question is: plastic table. When Lily and her brother tried to play with the marbles on the bedspread, they observed that the marbles barely moved. This is because a fabric bedspread has a rough surface, which creates more friction between the marbles and the bedspread. Friction is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion of objects in contact with each other. When they switched to playing with the marbles on a plastic table, they noticed that the marbles moved in all directions much more easily. This is because the plastic table has a smoother surface than the bedspread, resulting in less friction between the marbles and the table. With reduced friction, it becomes easier for the marbles to roll and move around when applied with force.

Passage:Coldingham Priory was a house of Benedictine monks. It lies on the south-east coast of Scotland, in the village of Coldingham, Berwickshire. Coldingham Priory was founded in the reign of David I of Scotland, although his older brother and predecessor King Edgar of Scotland had granted the land of Coldingham to the Church of Durham in 1098, and a church was constructed by him and presented in 1100. The first prior of Coldingham is on record by the year 1147, although it is likely that the foundation was much earlier. The earlier monastery at Coldingham was founded by St Æbbe sometime c. 640 AD. Although the monastery was largely destroyed by Oliver Cromwell in 1650, some remains of the priory exist, the choir of which forms the present parish church of Coldingham and is serviced by the Church of Scotland.

Options are: -throw away the frogs -wanted to have play-time -talk about the frogs Answer:","response":"Addison would want to have play-time. Step 1: Read the context carefully The context states that Addison had some toy frogs and added to their collection. This implies that they have an interest in the toy frogs and enjoy collecting them. Step 2: Evaluate the options based on the context Option 1: Throw away the frogs This option does not align with the context, as Addison enjoys collecting toy frogs and has just added to their collection. It's unlikely that they would want to throw them away. Option 2: Wanted to have play-time This option is more in line with the context, as Addison enjoys collecting toy frogs and has just added to their collection. It's likely that they would want to have play-time to enjoy their expanded collection. Option 3: Talk about the frogs While this option could also align with the context, it is less likely than Option 2, as the desire to play with the new additions to the collection would be greater than the need to talk about them. Additionally, the context doesn't mention any social setting or other people to talk about the frogs with. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate option based on the evaluation Based on the evaluation, Option 2 (wanted to have play-time) is the most appropriate option as it aligns best with the context provided.

New research suggests that the number of us who now eat at our dining or kitchen table is shockingly low. Just five per cent of those polled ate every meal at the table, compared with 13 per cent of those who ate at least one meal a day there. The traditional scene of a family sitting to enjoy a meal together may become a thing of the past, as a third only use their table a few times a year. Almost a fifth of respondents (19 per cent) said that they ate one or two meals a week at the dining or kitchen table. Over a quarter, 26 per cent, of those surveyed confessed to eating at the table no less than once or twice a month and nearly a third (30 per cent) admitted to using it just a few times a year. Only four per cent said they never ate any meals at the table whilst three per cent said they didn’t even own one. Sitting down to meals has been replaced by eating on the go to keep up with fast paced modern lifestyles. A spokesperson from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research commented: ‘Compared to 40 years ago, we now live in a society which moves at an extremely fast pace. Often, breakfast has to be eaten on the go, and in many cases so does lunch. 1. Every meal - 5%. 2. At least one meal a day - 13%. 3. At least once or twice a week - 19%. 4. At least once or twice a month - 26%. 5. A few times a year - 30%. 6. Never - 4%. 7. Don’t have a dining/kitchen table - 3%. ‘Also, with people working longer hours, a quick ready meal or a takeaway in front of the TV is the easiest option.’ One woman said: ‘I always make sure my children eat at the dining table, but once you’ve got home from work, fed them and put them to bed, it’s all you can do to crash out in front of the TV with a jacket potato. ‘I can remember always having meals at the table, but then again my mum was a homemaker and had the time to prepare everything.’ Another man commented: ‘I hardly ever eat at the table, I think the only times I do are at Christmas and Easter. ‘In fact the only table I regularly eat at is my desk in the office when I am having my lunch.’ One final respondent said of the poll: ‘I am really worried that my children are growing up in a society where eating meals at the table is something special and not the norm. ‘What does it say about family life in this country if all we can do at meal times is sit and watch the television while stuffing our faces.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"The article discusses the decline of eating meals at dining tables among Britons, with a third admitting to using the table only a few times a year.

(WhiteHouse.gov) President Obama was at Northwestern University on Thursday to deliver an economic speech that, he and his team hoped, would lay out the case for why the public is better off today than they were six years ago -- even if they didn't feel it in their everday lives. Instead, Obama just gave every Republican ad-maker in the country more fodder for negative ads linking Democratic candidates to him. Here are the four sentences that will draw all of the attention (they come more than two thirds of the way through the speech): \\"I am not on the ballot this fall. Michelle’s pretty happy about that. But make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\\" Boil those four sentences down even further and here's what you are left with: \\"Make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\\" You can imagine Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas or Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina or Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky grimacing when they heard those 28 words. That trio has spent much of the campaign insisting that this election is NOT about Barack Obama, that it is instead about a choice between themselves and their opponents. The reason for this distancing strategy is obvious: President Obama is deeply unpopular in many of the states that will decide which party controls the majority in 2015. Of the seven seats rated \\"toss ups\\" by the non-partisan Cook Political Report, Obama lost four of them (Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina) in 2012. He also lost in three Democratic-held open seats -- Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia -- now viewed as sure-thing pickups for Republicans. If Republicans only won Democratic-held seats where Obama lost in 2012, they would pick up 7 seats -- one more than they need to recapture the majority. In many of these states, Obama's numbers are in a (much) worse place today than in November 2012. Just four in ten Louisiana voters approve of how President Obama is doing his job in a recent CNN/Opinion Research poll. In Arkansas, Obama's approval rating is at 31 percent, according to an NBC/Marist poll. Even in Colorado, a state Obama won in 2008 and 2012, his approval rating sat at just 39 percent in another NBC/Marist survey. It doesn't take a political mastermind to realize that an ad in which the President of the United States says \\"Make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them\\" might not be helpful to the Democratic candidates trying to run away from him this November. So, why did Obama say it? My guess is that he wanted to make the stakes clear to a Democratic base that, by virtually every polling measure I've seen, is less enthusiastic to turn out and vote on Nov. 4 than Republicans. The idea being that if you like Obama and his policies -- which his base, especially African Americans, still do -- then you need to show it by going out and voting. The Obama political team is working under the assumption that if you dislike President Obama, nothing he says or does is going to change that reality. So, why not show the Democratic base that this election is worth fighting for? I think that underestimates the impact of an unpopular president (on video no less!) bluntly insisting that an election in 33 days is indeed a referendum on his policies. Republicans couldn't have written a better script than that. Chris Cillizza writes “The Fix,” a politics blog for the Washington Post. He also covers the White House.

The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Forest fires can contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), by releasing stored carbon from vegetation and soils. Moreover, large fires can produce significant amounts of fine particulate matter which can alter the balance of shortwave and longwave radiation in Earth's atmosphere, either warming or cooling the planet on a regional scale. When forests are protected from fires and well-managed, they act as valuable carbon sinks, as trees capture CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in organic matter through the process of photosynthesis. By containing forest fires, forest rangers aid in the preservation of these valuable resources and maintain the forests' ability to absorb more atmospheric CO2. Consequently, this mitigates the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, contributing to a lessened greenhouse effect. Moreover, healthy forests also regulate water cycles and release water vapor to the atmosphere, which may help cool the Earth's surface by reflecting incoming solar radiation. Preventing forest fires promotes the long-term health and resilience of these ecosystems and their capacity to continue to mitigate greenhouse effects. In conclusion, if forest rangers are more diligent in watching for and preventing fires, it will likely contribute to a reduction in the greenhouse effect by preserving the forests' capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide and maintain the Earth's essential hydrological systems, thus leading to a decrease in the overall temperature on the planet."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: For tour operators and travel agents Gospredprinimatelstvo with the Ministry of Culture has prepared a new license terms (their predecessors, approved by order of 17.01.2001, № 7 / 62 shall be deemed invalid).

I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it.

Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Story: A chef is preparing ribs for his clients dinner tonight. He decides to use a pressure cooker to help keep them nice and tender. He loads the ribs in the pressure cooker and closes the latches which are relatively easy to clamp down. After cooking for a while the latches seem much tighter and the lid much harder to move. Question: Will the amount of kinetic energy of gas molecules increase or decrease as their temperature rises?

For example, the doctor will likely measure the thickness of the wall of the left ventricle (the major pumping chamber of the heart). If it is thicker than 1.5 cm, this is considered abnormal. This or other thickened heart walls could indicate several problems including: High blood pressure Weak heart valves Damaged valves These measures can indicate whether your heart is pumping enough blood to supply your body with the oxygen it needs. If not, you are at risk for heart failure. There are two measurements the doctor may discuss with you: Left ventricular ejection fraction. This is the percentage of blood that is expelled from the heart during a heartbeat. A left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% is considered normal. Cardiac output. This is the volume of blood that the heart pumps per minute. At rest the average adult's heart pumps 4.8 to 6.4 liters of blood per minute. If parts of the wall of the heart are not pumping strongly, this can help the doctor pinpoint areas that have been damaged. This can occur due to tissue damage from a prior heart attack or coronary artery disease. Your doctor will be looking for several things: Hyperkinesis. This occurs when the heart or parts of the walls of the heart contract too much. Hypokinesis. This occurs when the contractions are too weak. Akinesis. This occurs when the tissue does not contract. Dyskinesis. This occurs when the wall of the heart bulges out when it should be contracting. You will likely be able to see the valves as gray lines that open and close with each beat of the heart enabling blood to pass between the chambers. Possible problems that you may see could be: A valve does not close tightly and it lets blood flow backwards through it. A valve does not open all the way so it restricts blood flow. You may be able to observe structural problems such as: Openings between chambers that should not be there Passages between the heart and blood vessels Heart defects that are developing a fetus","response":"An enlarged or thickened heart can indicate issues such as high blood pressure, weak or damaged valves, potentially leading to heart failure. Doctors may measure the left ventricular wall thickness, and analyze left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output to assess the heart's functionality. They will also look for signs of hyperkinesis, hypokinesis, akinesis, and dyskinesis, which represent varying levels of heart wall contractions. Valves should be observed to ensure proper opening and closing for blood flow, while structural problems and heart defects should also be identified."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"The Apaches, they do not touch a man they believe insane, and Amos has many peculiarities: peculiarities of dress, of speech, of action.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Amos liked to wear animal costumes. \\" is true?","response":"Step 1: Identify the given premises. - The Apaches do not touch a man they believe insane. - Amos has many peculiarities: peculiarities of dress, of speech, of action.

Options: - container - supermarket - pantry - sandwich - jar Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"Peanut butter can be stored in a variety of ways depending on the duration and purpose of storage. Here are the options you provided and how peanut butter can be stored in each of them: 1. Container: A food-grade airtight container is a good option for storing peanut butter at home. Make sure the container is clean and dry before transferring the peanut butter to prevent contamination. 2. Supermarket: At supermarkets, peanut butter is typically stored on shelves in its original packaging, which is usually a sealed plastic or glass jar. It's kept at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and major temperature fluctuations. 3. Pantry: The pantry is an ideal place for storing peanut butter at home because it is cool, dry, and away from direct sunlight. Store it in a closed jar or airtight container. Unopened peanut butter can last several months past its expiration date if stored properly, while opened peanut butter can last 2-3 months. 4. Sandwich: When peanut butter is used as a filling in a sandwich, it is best to store the sandwich in a refrigerator to maintain freshness and avoid spoilage. Place the sandwich in a sealed sandwich bag or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. The sandwich should be consumed within a day or two for the best quality, as prolonged storage of peanut butter in a sandwich could lead to the bread becoming soggy or stale. 5. Jar: Storing peanut butter in a jar is the most common method, whether it is a store-bought jar or a glass jar you reuse at home. Ensure the jar is clean and dry before adding peanut butter. For opened peanut butter jars, store them at room temperature in a cool, dark place like a pantry. For unopened jars, you can follow the same storage method until the expiration date and even beyond if the seal is not broken."},{"question":"My question is: Jake delivers 234 newspapers a week. Miranda delivers twice as many newspapers a week. How many more newspapers does Miranda deliver than Jake in a month? Your thoughts:","response":"To answer this question, let's first determine how many newspapers Miranda delivers in a week, and then compare their monthly deliveries. Since Miranda delivers twice as many newspapers as Jake, and Jake delivers 234 newspapers a week: Miranda's weekly deliveries = 2 * Jake's weekly deliveries Miranda's weekly deliveries = 2 * 234 Miranda's weekly deliveries = 468 newspapers Now let's calculate the difference in newspapers they deliver each week: Difference in weekly deliveries = Miranda's weekly deliveries - Jake's weekly deliveries Difference in weekly deliveries = 468 - 234 Difference in weekly deliveries = 234 newspapers To find the difference in the number of newspapers they deliver in a month, let's first clarify that a month typically has about 4 weeks.

A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point.

I'm not happy that in the final minutes of his life he was in that much pain, and I don't want to be reminded of it. \\"I feel very sorry about what I have done and I don't want to see anything like that happen in my lifetime again.\\" When he was asked why he did not stop stabbing Mr Lock after he fell to the ground, he replied: \\"It's as if his anger has been put on to me and I'm trying to get rid of it.\\" When asked why he had to use a knife, Mr Daley said it was \\"in his mind to protect himself\\". He also said he had stopped taking medication to help him sleep a year before the attack. During the interview he said he had recently split up from his girlfriend but was \\"making efforts to win her back\\". Jurors have been told Mr Daley had suffered from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had \\"pleaded\\" with mental health experts to have him sectioned. Defence counsel David Howker QC told the court he would not be calling Mr Daley to give evidence, but added: \\"There is other evidence to call.\\" The court heard Mr Daley saw consultant forensic psychiatrist Jake Harvey the day after the killing and told him he felt he had been getting less help with his mental health, was being seen by \\"too many trainee nurses\\", and had not been taking an anti-psychotic drug he had previously been prescribed. He described hearing \\"so many juvenile voices running through my head\\" which he said were \\"angry\\" and \\"overwhelming\\", jurors heard. In a statement, Mr Harvey said although he believed Mr Daley had a mental disorder, he was not so acutely mentally unwell that he needed urgent transfer for psychiatric treatment, and was fit to be charged. Consultant clinical psychologist Dr Michael Lawson assessed Mr Daley in November 2015 when he was admitted to Hellingly medium-secure unit. He said his primary diagnosis was paranoid schizophrenia and exaggerated autistic traits. He said: \\"My conclusion was that at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Daley was in all likelihood beginning to break down and experiencing the acute symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, although I don't think he was at the point of being incapacitated.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"1. Donald Lock, a 79-year-old retired solicitor, was stabbed 39 times in a road incident. The suspect, 35-year-old Matthew Daley, although admitting to the act, denies murder, citing diminished responsibility due to feeling threatened and afraid by Mr. Lock's driving before the collision. 2. Daley explained that he felt Lock was driving very close to him and behaving aggressively. When confronted by Lock after a collision, Daley stabbed Lock multiple times. 3. At court, Daley expressed regret about his actions and the pain inflicted on Lock in his final moments. He suggested his act was a response to the anger he felt was projected onto him. He defended his use of a knife as a measure of self-protection. 4. Daley had mental health issues for ten years and had stopped taking his sleep medication a year prior. His family had previously sought to have him sectioned for his mental issues. 5. Consultant forensic psychiatrist, Jake Harvey, assessed Daley post incident.

The town is on the road to Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, and a group of fighters started to march in its direction, journalist Phil Moore told CNN. Moore and U.N. spokesman Kieran Dwyer said the M23 fighters held Sake after two days of battling government troops in the town they first entered Wednesday. The United Nations, which supports the Congolese army, as well as Britain have condemned the rebel campaign intended to overthrow the government. Read more: Rebel leader in Uganda for Congo crisis talks. On Friday, the Congolese army was near the town of Minova, about 15 miles south of Sake, according to Moore. Residents fled ahead of M23's progress, Moore said, and a second group of M23 fighters was heading north to the town of Masisi. The fighting continued despite a joint statement Wednesday from the leaders of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda that called for M23 to halt its rebellion and enter talks with the Kinshasa government. Read more: Rebels threaten wider Democratic Republic of Congo conflict. \\"The M23 rebel group must immediately stop its offensive and pull out of Goma,\\" the statement said, adding that the Congo government committed itself to addressing rebel complaints. The latest unrest continues a cycle of violence and misery in Eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. The political leader of M23, Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, flew Thursday to the Ugandan capital of Kampala for talks with President Yoweri Museveni, who is hosting a conference of regional leaders Saturday aimed at ending the crisis in Congo. Dwyer said the Kampala summit, which also will include Congo President Joseph Kabila and Rwandan President Paul Kagame, would be scrutinized for any political impetus to stop the violence on the ground. \\"There does need to be political solutions to this,\\" he said. \\"I don't think battlefield solutions are going to be the answer in and of themselves.\\" The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers. Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation. On Tuesday, the rebels gained control of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, though U.N. forces continued to control the airport. At a rally at Goma's stadium, an M23 officer declared the group's military goals. \\"We will push on to Bukavu, then Kisangani, and finally take Kinshasa and overthrow the government,\\" Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarama said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred, according to a Congolese reporter there. Read more: Can we end rape as tool of war? Mark Simmonds, the UK minister for Africa, arrived in Kigali, Rwanda, on Thursday and immediately issued a statement saying \\"there can be no attempt to unseat the legitimate government of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\" He called on the Congolese government to \\"address the underlying causes of the conflict.\\" \\"I call on the M23 to stop its advance and to withdraw from Goma immediately,\\" Simmonds said. Oxfam, which is monitoring humanitarian conditions in the area, warned Thursday that the fall of Goma to the rebels poses \\"a very real risk of complete collapse of state authority and the humanitarian crisis reaching new depths.\\" It estimated that 120,000 people were in urgent need of help, with many sleeping in the open or in schools and other buildings without humanitarian aid.

A professional thief ( Thomas Jane ) takes a former race car driver ( John Cusack ) hostage and forces him to drive his getaway car . A professional thief ( Thomas Jane ) takes a former racing driver ( John Cusack ) hostage and forces him to drive his car .","response":"While these two sentences describe similar situations, they have slight differences in terms of details and specificity. Here is a detailed comparison between the two sentences: 1. Sentence 1: \\"A professional thief (Thomas Jane) takes a former race car driver (John Cusack) hostage and forces him to drive his getaway car.\\" In this sentence, the professional thief (played by Thomas Jane) takes a former race car driver (played by John Cusack) hostage. The victim's background as a race car driver gives us a clear idea regarding his experience and skills in driving cars, specifically high-performance race cars. This detail could be relevant to the story, as it suggests that the former race car driver might possess unique abilities as a driver that the professional thief needs for making his escape. The sentence also mentions that the thief forces the victim to drive his \\"getaway car.\\" This is an important detail because it implies that the car the victim is forced to drive is specifically meant for escape after the crime, possibly prepared beforehand by the thief. This could provide a sense of urgency in the situation, as the thief's plan depends on the successful escape in the getaway car. 2. Sentence 2: \\"A professional thief (Thomas Jane) takes a former racing driver (John Cusack) hostage and forces him to drive his car.\\" In this sentence, the professional thief (played by Thomas Jane) takes a former racing driver (played by John Cusack) hostage. The phrase \\"racing driver\\" is a more general term compared to \\"race car driver,\\" as it encompasses any driver who participates in racing events, regardless of the specific type of race car. Although this might seem like a subtle difference, it slightly widens the range of possible vehicle types the character might have experience with. The sentence ends with the thief forcing the victim to drive \\"his car.\\" This does not specify whether it is a getaway car or simply a regular car. Without this detail, it may imply that the victim has to act as a driver for the professional thief in any context, which could be either escaping from a crime scene or any other activity. In summary, the main differences between the two sentences are: 1. The specificity of the hostage's driving background: race car driver vs. racing driver. 2. The description of the car: getaway car vs. an unspecified car. These differences impact the interpretation of the situation and the potential implications on the story, making them similar in concept but having minor distinctions in their descriptions."},{"question":"Solve this math problem Solve -7657*n + 31104 = 7914*n - 15814*n for n.","response":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step. First, you have -7657 * n + 31104 = 7914 * n - 15814 * n. Now we have to combine the n terms on the right side of the equation: 7914 * n - 15814 * n = (7914 - 15814) * n = -7890 * n So now the equation looks like this: -7657 * n + 31104 = -7890 * n Now let's move all the n terms to the left side of the equation. To do that, we will add 7890 * n to both sides: (-7657 * n + 7890 * n) + 31104 = -7890 * n + 7890 * n This simplifies to: 233 * n + 31104 = 0 Now, let's move the 31104 to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 233 * n = -31104 Finally, we have to find what \\"n\\" is, and to do that, we will divide both sides by 233: n=-31104 ÷ 233 So now we found that: n = -134 So the answer to the math problem is n = -134."},{"question":"Translate the following.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: Considering the impact of climate change and global warming on our planet, it has become more important than ever to adopt environmentally friendly practices in our daily lives. Although large-scale measures undertaken by governments and organizations are vital, individual actions also contribute to the preservation of our environment. By making small modifications in our behavior and consumption habits, we can reduce our ecological footprint and further protect the Earth. For instance, opting for reusable bags instead of plastic ones can help reduce plastic waste in oceans and landfills. Furthermore, taking public transportation or carpooling can lower greenhouse gas emissions that arise from the use of personal vehicles. Conserving water when brushing our teeth, showering, or washing dishes is another small yet effective way to reduce waste. Moreover, purchasing items with minimal packaging, using energy-efficient appliances, and recycling can reduce our overall resource consumption. We must acknowledge the collective power of these small daily changes, as they compound and create significant positive impacts on the environment. Through individual responsibility and intentional habits, we can indeed become more environmentally friendly.

Article: When I was about eight years old, I decided that I wanted to be a famous film star when I grew up. Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals and pour thick flour over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios _ . - spend a lot money on computers - use a lot of common sound in films - use computers for everyday sounds - give Foley artists a lot of new ideas Answer:","response":"Most modern studios use computers for everyday sounds. The article explains that in the past, creating \\"everyday\\" sounds was labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring a Foley artist's expertise and imagination to replicate these noises. However, with technological advancements, these sounds are now readily available and generated through computer software. This shift in method not only alleviates the pressure on Foley artists but also allows them to dedicate more of their time to creating unusual sound effects. The automation of everyday sound production has therefore streamlined efficiencies and reduced stress within film studio environments."},{"question":"Treasury notes (or T-notes) mature in two to ten years, have a coupon payment every six months, and have denominations of 1,000.

Should I get plastic surgery when I go to Korea? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available choices: * no. * yes.","response":"Bridget Marquardt, an American television personality, gained fame primarily as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends in the reality TV show \\"The Girls Next Door.\\" She underwent several plastic surgery procedures throughout the years; however, it is essential to note that any specific procedures are speculative and have not been officially confirmed by Marquardt herself. Some of the rumored plastic surgery procedures that Bridget Marquardt is believed to have undergone include: 1. Breast augmentation: It was rumored that Marquardt had breast implants early in her career, supposedly increasing her breasts size. 2. Rhinoplasty (nose job): Some people speculated that she had her nose refined, as there seems to be a difference in the shape of her nose in later pictures compared to earlier ones. 3. Botox injections: It is assumed that Marquardt might have had Botox injections to maintain her youthful appearance, which leads to the reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. 4. Lip fillers: Observers of Marquardt's transformation have also suggested that she may have had her lips subtly enhanced using lip fillers, resulting in fuller and more defined lips. As for the second question about getting plastic surgery in Korea, it is a personal choice heavily dependent on individual preferences, values, and circumstances. South Korea is well-known for its high-quality plastic surgery clinics, skilled surgeons, and advanced techniques. However, before making a decision, there are few things you should consider: 1. Research: Thoroughly research the specific surgery or procedure you want to undergo, possible complications, and expected outcomes. 2. Choose the right clinic and surgeon: Take the time to choose an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon and a reputable clinic to attain the best possible results. 3. Cost: Plastic surgery can be expensive, and the costs can vary depending on the procedure and the clinic you select. Consider whether you can afford the procedure and if it is worth the investment. 4. Recovery time: Some procedures require an extensive recovery period that could interfere with your work, personal life, or travel plans. Ensure you have the time and support necessary for a smooth recovery. 5. Psychological impact: Plastic surgery can have profound emotional and mental effects on individuals. Be aware of these potential consequences and ensure that you have the proper support to deal with them. Regarding the multi-choice problem, the correct choice is \\"no.\\" The two questions are not the same. The first question inquires about the specific plastic surgery procedures Bridget Marquardt underwent, while the second question is a query about whether the person should opt for plastic surgery in Korea. These are two distinct topics, one being about a celebrity's plastic surgery and the other addressing the personal consideration of undergoing plastic surgery."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A man and a woman beneath a shade tree saying a prayer.\\" is it true that \\"The man and women have the same religious background.\\"?

Typically, recipes for things like pancake or waffle batter begin with mixing together the dry ingredients such as flour, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. This step is important as it helps evenly distribute the baking powder or baking soda, which is what will help your batter rise when cooked. Just throwing everything into a bowl simultaneously could lead to uneven distribution, resulting in a less-than-ideal final product. It's recommended to whisk these dry ingredients together well before starting to incorporate your wet ingredients. So, your completed process would look like this: 1. Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. 2. Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter. 3. Mix until smooth. 4. Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high. 5. Pour batter onto the griddle.

Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys, such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Step 1: Identify the context of the question The context provided discusses the history, discovery, properties, and applications of zinc.

Each level has eight huge steps in the stairs. Every step is made up of three massive blocks of stone. By the time she reaches the top, she has climbed past 96 blocks of stone. How many levels are there in the tower? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step. 1. Each level has 8 huge steps. 2. Every step is made up of 3 massive blocks of stone. 3. Clara climbed past 96 blocks of stone to reach the top. First, let's find out how many blocks of stone are there in one level. To do that, we'll multiply the number of steps per level (8) by the number of blocks per step (3): 8 steps/level * 3 blocks/step = 24 blocks/level Now we know there are 24 blocks of stone in one level. To find out how many levels there are in the tower, we'll divide the total number of blocks Clara climbed (96) by the number of blocks per level (24): 96 blocks / 24 blocks/level = 4 levels So there are 4 levels in the tower."},{"question":"Solve this math problem Solve -25*g + 3*g = -3*g for g.","response":"To solve the equation -25g + 3g = -3g for the variable g, we will follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation 2. Isolate the variable g on one side of the equation 3.

The like terms are -25g and 3g. -25g + 3g = -22g Now the equation becomes: -22g = -3g Step 2: Isolate the variable g on one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 3g to both sides of the equation: -22g + 3g = -3g + 3g This simplifies to: -19g = 0 Step 3: Simplify the equation to find the value of g. Now it's time to find the value of g. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -19: -19g / -19 = 0 / -19 This simplifies to: g = 0 So, after solving the equation -25g + 3g = -3g for the variable g, we find that g = 0."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Voici une phrase en français: \\"Le chat est mignon.\\" Cela signifie \\"The cat is cute\\" en anglais.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. Question: The narrator's husband's shower likely lasted: Options: A. One hour. B. not enough information C. Several hours. D. A few minutes. === The correct answer is A:","response":"B. not enough information The passage does not provide explicit information about the duration of the husband's shower. The events are described in a manner that indicates a relatively short period of time, but the text does not provide enough information to determine the exact length of his shower.

Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: is it possible to be allergic to perfume? Possible answers: A). no B). yes","response":"B). yes It is indeed possible to be allergic to perfume, as the condition called perfume intolerance or perfume allergy demonstrates. This condition occurs when individuals display sensitivity or allergic reactions to certain ingredients present in some perfumes or other fragrances. Perfume intolerance can manifest through various symptoms, such as skin irritation, respiratory issues, or headaches. Perfume intolerance or allergy may be triggered by natural or synthetic ingredients found in perfumes, including essential oils, synthetic fragrances, and various other chemicals. In some cases, people might be affected by specific ingredients or substances, while others may be sensitive to a combination of ingredients. This varying degree of sensitivity can further contribute to the wide range of symptoms and reactions experienced by individuals. When individuals with perfume intolerance or allergy come into contact with the fragrance ingredients, their immune system may recognize these substances as harmful or foreign. This reaction results in the production of antibodies and the release of chemicals like histamine, which can cause allergic symptoms such as itching, redness, swelling, and congestion. To prevent or manage perfume intolerance or allergy, people should identify the specific ingredients or fragrances that trigger their symptoms. This can be achieved through patch testing, which involves applying small amounts of various fragrance components to the skin to observe their reactions. Once the problematic ingredients are identified, individuals should avoid products containing these substances, opting for fragrance-free or hypoallergenic alternatives instead. It is essential to raise awareness about perfume intolerance or allergy, as it can significantly impact individuals' quality of life. By understanding this condition and taking appropriate measures to prevent symptoms, one can better navigate environments with potentially triggering fragrances and ensure their well-being."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Her grandfather, Clem Mayer, had polio when he was 7 and served as mayor of Jackson, Wisconsin, for 32 years. She has a younger brother. She would later describe herself as having been \\"painfully shy\\" as a child and teenager. She \\"never had fewer than one after-school activity per day,\\" participating in ballet, ice-skating, piano, swimming, debate, and Brownies. During middle school and high school, she took piano and ballet lessons, the latter of which taught her \\"criticism and discipline, poise, and confidence\\". At an early age, she showed an interest in math and science. When she was attending Wausau West High School, Mayer was on the curling team and the precision dance team. She excelled in chemistry, calculus, biology, and physics. She took part in extracurricular activities, becoming president of her high school's Spanish club, treasurer of the Key Club, captain of the debate team, and captain of the pom-pom squad. Her high school debate team won the Wisconsin state championship and the pom-pom squad was the state runner-up. During high school, she worked as a grocery clerk. After graduating from high school in 1993, Mayer was selected by Tommy Thompson, then the Governor of Wisconsin, as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia. Intending to become a pediatric neurosurgeon, Mayer took pre-med classes at Stanford University. She later switched her major from pediatric neuroscience to symbolic systems, a major which combined philosophy, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and computer science. At Stanford, she danced in the university ballet's Nutcracker, was a member of parliamentary debate, volunteered at children's hospitals, and helped bring computer science education to Bermuda's schools. During her junior year, she taught a class in symbolic systems, with Eric S. Roberts as her supervisor.

When the marshal comments that Link looks familiar, Link gives him a false name. Aboard the train, Sam impulsively joins Link, learns of his mission in Fort Worth and claims he can be of help. Sam introduces him to the Crosscut saloon singer, Billie Ellis (Julie London), insisting she could make an ideal teacher. Their conversation is overheard by Alcutt, a shady-looking passenger. When the train stops to pick up wood for additional fuel, male passengers help load the train but Alcutt remains on board, feigning sleep.

As offices around the world have shut their doors, employees have had to adapt to remote work, leveraging digital tools to maintain productivity, collaboration, and communication. While some companies have embraced remote work as a temporary solution, others have chosen to make it a long-term company policy. As businesses continue to adapt, there has been ongoing debate on the impact of this new work model on employee engagement, mental health, and work-life balance. Hypothesis: The widespread implementation of remote work policies could lead to an overall improvement in employee engagement, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, as long as companies effectively utilize digital tools, establish clear communication guidelines, and provide necessary support structures for their employees. This hypothesis is based on the belief that if remote work is managed correctly, it could offer numerous advantages for both employees and companies. For instance, employees could benefit from a more flexible work schedule, reduced commuting time, and the opportunity to design their workspace according to their preferences. On the other hand, companies could potentially reduce costs associated with office spaces, increase access to a diverse talent pool, and enhance employee retention. To test this hypothesis, a research study could be designed to collect data from various companies that are implementing remote work policies. Data could include levels of employee engagement, job satisfaction, and work-life balance before and after implementing remote work, along with the measures taken by each company to support their remote employees. Employees could be surveyed to gather data on their experiences, concerns, and preferences in regard to remote work. Furthermore, interviews could be conducted with company management to gain insight into their remote work policies, expectations, challenges faced, and the impact remote work has had on their workforce. This data could then be analyzed to determine if a correlation exists between the remote work policies and the employees' engagement, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, as well as the importance of company support, tools, and communication in facilitating successful remote work experiences. If the hypothesis is confirmed, it could suggest that companies should invest time and resources in creating remote work policies that prioritize employee engagement, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, as well as adopting the necessary digital tools and cultivating a remote work culture that supports these values."},{"question":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?. President Barack Obama made a rare 2014 campaign stop on Tuesday evening in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to rally the party faithful for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke. At a packed gymnasium, Obama held up Democrat Mary Burke as a skilled businesswoman who will fight for the type of middle-class opportunity that made his own success possible. Riffing on health care, the minimum wage and women's issues, Obama steered clear of referring directly to the state's Republican governor, Scott Walker, instead lumping him together with a Republican Party he accused of pushing antiquated and failed policies - such as opposition to fair pay legislation backed by Democrats. 'Wisconsin can't afford a governor who will walk lock-step with President Obama and his failed policies that have hurt our country and would take","response":"Wisconsin backwards', said Scott Walker in a statement responding to Obama's rally. The Republican incumbent argued that the state needed strong, independent leadership, not a governor who will merely toe the party line. Walker further attacked Burke's credentials as a businesswoman, alleging that her past economic decisions had proven detrimental to Wisconsin's business community. He ended his statement by reiterating his commitment to policies that support business growth and job creation in the state. Walker's robust response indicates that the gubernatorial race in Wisconsin is heating up, with both candidates responding fiercely to each other's campaigns.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","response":"No, the provided information does not correctly answer the question about how the capital city of Brazil, Brasília, was created. The information given pertains to the city's per capita income, not its creation. Allow me to provide a detailed and accurate answer to the question: Brasília, the capital of Brazil, was created as a result of a development plan initiated by President Juscelino Kubitschek. The construction of Brasília was part of a larger plan known as \\"Plano de Metas\\" (Plan of Goals), which aimed to develop different sectors of Brazil's economy, such as energy, transport, and education, among others. The main objective of creating Brasília was to stimulate growth and development in the central-western region of Brazil, as well as to reduce the concentration of political and economic power in the coastal cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The decision to build the new capital was based on Article 4 of the Brazilian Constitution of 1891, which stated the need to create a new capital in the country's interior. The idea was revisited in the 1950s during President Kubitschek's term, and the new capital was seen as a symbol of modernity and progress for Brazil. The location for the new capital was strategically chosen in the Central Plateau of Brazil, approximately 1,000 kilometers west of Rio de Janeiro. This region was chosen for its relatively flat terrain, availability of water resources, and a favorable climate. In 1956, a committee led by Marechal José Pessoa was responsible for selecting the site for Brasília. To design the new capital, a competition was held in 1956, and architects from around the world were invited to present their ideas. Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer won the competition along with urban planner Lúcio Costa. Costa's design, known as the \\"Plano Piloto,\\" featured the city in the shape of an airplane, with different zones dedicated to various functions, such as residential, commercial, and administrative areas. Oscar Niemeyer, on the other hand, contributed with many iconic and modernist buildings, such as the National Congress, Cathedral, Planalto Palace, and the Alvorada Palace. The construction of Brasília started on April 20, 1956, and the city was officially inaugurated on April 21, 1960. The new capital attracted thousands of workers and settlers during the construction process, known as \\"Candangos.\\" These workers played a vital role in the city's construction, shaping its demographics, culture, and society. In summary, the creation of Brasília resulted from a development plan initiated by President Juscelino Kubitschek, aiming to promote growth in the interior while reducing the power concentration in coastal cities. The capital was strategically located in the Central Plateau, and its design was selected through an international competition, with Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa shaping the city's iconic appearance."},{"question":"Q:Given the following passage \\"As with the rest of the UK, Southampton experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb).

Answer the above question based on the context below: The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. Dürer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\". Dürer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\".Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although Dürer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The... Answer:","response":"The name of the person who drew \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is Albrecht Dürer. He was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist who lived during the Renaissance. His work displayed a high level of technical excellence and intricate detail, showcased particularly in his portraiture. As the context indicates, Dürer was greatly influenced by southern German portraiture of the late 15th century, the Early Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and his own father, Albrecht the Elder. Dürer's \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is an artwork depicting Christ suffering, a theme commonly seen in Christian art during the time. It shows a deep emotional intensity and exemplifies Dürer's ability to skillfully capture complex human emotions and expressions. In the context provided, it is evident that Dürer developed his unique artistic style by blending various influences from different artistic traditions, including elements of southern German portraiture, Early Netherlandish painting techniques, and the use of silverpoint. Through his mastery of various mediums and techniques, Dürer managed to distinguish himself from his contemporaries. His attention to detail and strong focus on his subjects' faces made his work both visually striking and emotionally powerful. Additionally, his interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance is evident in his self-portraits and his portraits of his parents, which showcase the progression of aging and its impact on facial features. In conclusion, the person who drew \\"Man of Sorrows\\" is Albrecht Dürer, a prominent Renaissance artist known for his technical excellence and keen observational abilities. His artwork was a product of the influences and inspiration he drew from various artistic traditions, which he successfully combined to create a distinct and compelling style."},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a question.

As many as 50 percent of high school students currently drink alcohol, and within that group, up to 60 percent binge drink, the authors wrote in the report, published today (Aug. 31) in the journal Pediatrics. Among 12- to 14-year-olds who drink, approximately half binge drink, according to the report. And while the total number of binge drinkers this age remains very low (the authors cite one survey which revealed 0.8 percent of 12- to 14-year-olds binge drink), parents should still be aware of the consequences. The reason to start talking to kids about alcohol before they even reach middle school is that \\"kids are starting to develop impressions [about alcohol] as early as 9 years,\\" said Dr. Lorena Siqueira, clinical professor of pediatrics at Florida International University and co-author of the new report. So for prevention to work, it's better for parents to influence children's ideas about alcohol early, rather than trying to change their impressions later, from positive to negative, she said. \\"[Alcohol] is the substance most frequently abused by children and adolescents,\\" Siqueira told Live Science. But because it's a legal substance, the consequences are downplayed, she said. [The Drug Talk: New Tips for Today's Parents] \\"When I have kids in the ICU [intensive care unit], and I tell the parents it's alcohol, they're relieved,\\" Siqueira said. But they shouldn't feel relief, she added. \\"[Alcohol] is a killer,\\" she said. What is binge drinking? According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in six adults binge drinks about four times a month. But although binge drinking in adults refers to five or more alcoholic drinks for men, and four or more for women over a 2-hour period, the cutoffs are lower for teens because people that age weigh less, the authors of the report said. For some teens, having even three drinks is considered binge drinking, according to the report. And having fewer drinks than that should not be considered safe. Part of the problem is how adolescents drink, Siqueira said. They often turn to vodka, she said. And they drink very fast, often directly from the bottle, with the goal of getting drunk — and this can kill them, she said. Nearly a third of fatal car accidents among 15- to 20-year-olds involve alcohol, according to the report. Drinking at a young age may also interrupt key processes of brain development and increase the risk of developing a chronic alcohol use disorder, according to the report. Tips for parents To warn children about the dangers of alcohol abuse, Siqueira recommends parents use every available opportunity to talk about the issue. \\"[Alcohol is] ubiquitous\\" she said. And kids see it everywhere — on the sides of buses, on billboards and in movies, she said. \\"If you're driving, and you see someone swerving, talk about that. If you see it in a movie, talk to your kids about it then,\\" she said. Parents should also set a good example for their kids, Siqueira said. Eighty percent of teenagers say that their parents are the biggest influence on their decision to drink, according to the report. That doesn't mean parents can't have a glass of wine in front of children, but getting drunk in front of the kids is a bad idea, Siqueira said. Parents should also avoid talking about alcohol to fix problems, like coming home and saying, \\"I need a drink,\\" she added. And when parents take their kids to the doctor for a checkup, they should let the child talk to the doctor alone, Siqueira said. This way, kids can feel like they're in a judgement-free environment, she said. Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Parents and doctors need to take the lead in talking to kids about drinking, and they need to do it before children try their first sip, the main pediatricians’ group says. And that moment might come sooner than most adults think it should, the American Academy of Pediatrics says in new guidance published Monday. It’s before they’re even 10 years old. \\"Surveys indicate that children start to think positively about alcohol between ages 9 and 13 years. The more young people are exposed to alcohol advertising and marketing, the more likely they are to drink, and if they are already drinking, this exposure leads them to drink more,\\" Dr. Lorena Siqueira, a Miami pediatrician, and colleagues write in the journal Pediatrics. \\"Therefore, it is very important to start talking to children about the dangers of drinking as early as 9 years of age.\\" \\"It is very important to start talking to children about the dangers of drinking as early as 9 years of age.” Parents may not realize their kids are trying booze so young. And pediatricians may not think to ask a pre-teen about it. \\"Twenty-one percent of youth acknowledge having had more than a sip of alcohol before 13 years of age, and most (79 percent) have done so by 12th grade,\\" Siqueira and colleagues wrote. Kids tend to overdo it, Siqueira and colleagues said. It’s partly because they are exploring and testing limits. \\"Among youth who drink, the proportion who drink heavily is higher than among adult drinkers, rising from approximately 50 percent in those 12 to 14 years of age to 72 percent among those 18 to 20 years of age,\\" they wrote. \\"Alcohol is the substance most frequently used by children and adolescents in the United States, and its use in youth is associated with the leading causes of death and serious injury at this age (i.e., motor vehicle accidents, homicides, and suicides).\\" So ask, the experts urged their colleagues. \\"During office visits, because alcohol use is so common, it is important for pediatricians to screen every adolescent for alcohol use. Just using one’s clinical impression can underestimate substance use, and therefore structured screening instruments are recommended,\\" they advised. There's good news for parents who feel their kids just ignore them. \\"Physicians can also inform parents that 80 percent of teenagers say their parents are the biggest influence on their decision whether to drink.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"A new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics says that parents should start talking to their children about alcohol at age 9 to help prevent binge drinking later on.

Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. I am facing a new situation today: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which patient would have lower level of testosterone, patient A or patient C? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the details of the new situation, patient A, a male with Klinefelter's syndrome, would have a lower level of testosterone compared to patient C, who is a male without any of these illnesses. Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs due to the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. This extra genetic material interferes with male sexual development and affects the normal functioning of the testicles. As a result, individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome have reduced levels of testosterone, which is the primary male sex hormone responsible for the development of male reproductive tissues, secondary sexual characteristics, and sexual function. In contrast, patient C is a male without Klinefelter's syndrome or any of the other mentioned genetic conditions. Therefore, it is expected that patient C would have normal testicular function and testosterone levels, which would be higher than the testosterone levels in patient A, who has Klinefelter's syndrome. In conclusion, patient A, the male with Klinefelter's syndrome, would have a lower level of testosterone compared to patient C, a male without any of these illnesses."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: Meningitis threatens hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur. More than a million at risk of starvation after aid agencies expelled, U.N. warns. Sources: Aid workers harassed and detained by the Sudanese government. Article:","response":"Title: Meningitis Outbreak and Starvation Threaten Darfur amid Ongoing Humanitarian Crisis Introduction: An imminent health catastrophe looms over Darfur, with hundreds of thousands of people threatened by a deadly meningitis outbreak. The United Nations (U.N.) has warned that over a million individuals are now at risk of starvation following the expulsion of key aid agencies from the region. These developments compound an already significant humanitarian crisis, with reports of aid workers facing harassment and detention by the Sudanese government. Step 1: Explain the menacing meningitis threat The meningitis outbreak in Darfur presents a grave concern for the region, as this highly infectious disease has the potential to decimate whole communities. Immediate health interventions are vital to control its spread. The disease can be particularly dangerous in overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions, which are unfortunately common in the conflict-torn region. Vulnerable groups, such as young children and the elderly, are at an increased risk of being affected, causing significant strain on the already fragile healthcare infrastructure. Step 2: Highlight the U.N.'s warning about widespread starvation In addition to the meningitis outbreak, the U.N. has warned that over a million people are now at risk of starvation after the expulsion of multiple aid agencies. These agencies play a pivotal role in ensuring that vital food and nutrition supplies reach the most vulnerable populations. The expulsion not only hinders their efforts but could also escalate the hunger crisis in the region, with potentially devastating consequences for the conflict-affected population. Step 3: Examine the treatment of aid workers by the Sudanese government As if these health and hunger challenges were not complex enough, aid workers and humanitarian organizations operating in Darfur have faced harassment and detention by the Sudanese government. Such actions undermine the critical work being done by these organizations and jeopardize the safety and well-being of vulnerable individuals who rely on their assistance. This persecution of aid workers also raises concerns about the Sudanese government's commitment to addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of its conflict-affected citizens. Conclusion: The grim situation in Darfur demands urgent global attention, as the converging crises of meningitis and widespread hunger threaten to add further destabilization to an already protracted conflict. The ongoing mistreatment of aid workers by the Sudanese government heightens the urgency for a comprehensive, multilateral response to address these pressing issues. The international community must recognize the severity of this humanitarian crisis and take swift, coordinated action to ensure that essential aid reaches those who need it most – before it is too late."},{"question":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

The premise states that there are existing election laws that prohibit the solicitation of money by both employees and nonemployees in all federal office buildings, including the White House. However, it does not directly indicate the specific reasons behind the creation of these laws or the role of the White House in crafting them. Election laws in the United States are regulated and enforced by multiple entities. At the federal level, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) is responsible for administering and overseeing campaign finance regulations. The FEC is an independent regulatory agency that upholds the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which regulates the financing of federal elections, including the solicitation of contributions. Additionally, election laws, including those related to campaign finance and solicitation, are enacted by the United States Congress, which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Moreover, the reasons behind enacting such laws can be multifaceted. The prohibition of solicitation of money in federal office buildings, including the White House, could be based on the principle of separating political activities from government functions and maintaining the impartiality of public institutions. This helps to avoid conflicts of interest, prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption, and ensure that government employees and officials carry out their duties responsibly and without external influence. In conclusion, although the premise provided establishes that there are indeed election laws prohibiting the solicitation of money in federal office buildings, it does not offer sufficient evidence to prove that the White House specifically enacted these laws due to increased solicitation activities. Rather, the laws were established by the US Congress and are enforced by regulatory bodies like the FEC to maintain the integrity of government institutions, prevent corruption, and ensure the appropriate allocation of resources."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field? , can you please find it? Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It has an elevation of 2,162 m (7,093 ft) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining products from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.Pali Dome, located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Like Cauldron Dome, it consists of two geological units. Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material. It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield. Much of the lava flows form...

During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins. They described the kivas as \\"circular apartments sunk in the ground\\". Simpson briefly explored..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The name of the building that the explorer found with a well-preserved room where \\"the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation\\" is Chetro Ketl. Chetro Ketl is one of the Chacoan great houses located in Chaco Canyon, which was first discovered by the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, in 1823. Later, in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, along with a group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon further. The group included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. During their exploration, they documented their findings, including the locations and styles of the great houses in Chaco Canyon, and specifically made note of the impressive masonry work at Chetro Ketl.

At the office Willard is constantly belittled by Martin, finding understanding from Joan Simms (Sondra Locke).At home there is the celebration of his birthday, Charlotte Stassen (Jody Gilbert) and the rest of his mom's friends nag him about being more aggressive and going for an executive job, although Henrietta thinks that he wouldn't have been able to take charge of the business. He is nagged by his mother, particularly to kill some rats she has seen in their backyard. In the process of exterminating the rats, Willard saves them and finds as he feeds and plays with them that he can train the animals, by feeding them, and setting himself in their instincts as a rescuer. He baits the rats onto a pillar in the center of a well, and removes the wood bridge that they crossed. Then, as he fills the well, they are frantic, and he replaces the wood bridge; thus he cements their allegiance, and, in effect communicates with them. Meanwhile, Charlotte appears to take care of Henrietta, who falls sick and is an annoyingly meddlesome woman.The mother rat, whose life Willard saved, brings one of her off-spring to him.

It was an exciting moment for the 46-year-old artist, who had painted almost every day since a trolley-car accident had put an end to her medical studies two months after her 18th birthday, and left her bedridden for two years. But despite her resilience – she had already survived more than 30 operations on her spine and pelvis – her husband, the muralist Diego Rivera, was worried that she would not be well enough to attend. At the last moment he organised for her to be transported to the gallery in her four-poster canopy bed. From its cushions, and wearing one of her typically resplendent traditional Tehuana dresses, she held court, elated by the turn-out. To one journalist she said, “I am broken. But I am happy to be alive as long as I can paint.” Kahlo died the following year, after months in hospital that left her in a drugged stupor. Her last request when she came home was that she be moved to a room with a better view; she wanted to see her garden. Now a new book, Frida Kahlo’s Garden, which accompanies an exhibition at the New York Botanical Garden, shows how Kahlo’s love of the plants and trees that grew there came to energise her life and art. In many respects, the Casa Azul, or Blue House, in the Coyoacán area of Mexico City, where Kahlo lived for most of her life, and its garden can be counted as one of her artworks. Bought by her father in 1904 – three years before she was born – it came to her in 1939, when Rivera took over the mortgage. Over the years she and Rivera renovated, expanded and re-envisioned both the house and garden to express their wide-ranging tastes and their commitment to the idea of Mexico. Kahlo in particular treasured plants and used her affinity for colour to assemble pots and plant beds, which she embellished with a roster of sculptures and ancient stones. Photographs from the time show every wall, railing and column bursting with climbing vegetation, and plants in every architectural niche. The garden was a place of both comfort and inspiration for Kahlo; an immersive world where she could think about her work or entertain friends. Of the photographs we have of Kahlo with her lover Leon Trotsky, the Russian revolutionary who spent his exile in Mexico, several picture the two in the garden. And when she took up teaching, she used it as an open-air classroom for her students, nicknamed “Los Fridos” for their disciple-like devotion. Inside the house, Kahlo took to creating compositions of fruits and flowers for Rivera. On a big pine table in her sunny dining room she would arrange varying combinations of marigolds, blue and white irises, dahlias, calla lilies and violets. • The secret diary of Frida Kahlo Kahlo’s penchant for collecting is well known. Throughout her life she amassed tens of thousands of objects, including porcelain tea sets, papier-mâché religious figures, rustic cooking vessels and hundreds of the devotional paintings on tin known as ex-votos. But she also had a fondness for books, and often pressed flowers within their pages. The exhibition contains her copy of Walt Whitman’s poetic masterpiece Leaves of Grass, complete with tiny bouquets of dried leaves and petals that have lain undisturbed for years. And although the majority of her books relate to art and literature, slotted among them are copies of botanical field guides, books on Mexican medicinal plants and even a copy of an illustrated herbal handbook dating from 1552, which provides first-hand descriptions of the plants used by the Aztecs; plants from its pages are well represented in Kahlo’s art. In Kahlo’s time there was a great movement around the world to learn about Mexico. Even though the country had consummated independence from Spain in 1821 and endured the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1917), when resentment against U.S. business interests had bubbled to the surface, it was still struggling to shape an identity. Art, architecture and day-to-day life were still overshadowed by European influence. Kahlo was very taken with the nationalistic cause. She altered her stated year of birth from 1907 to 1910, to coincide with the year the revolution began, and fought to maintain the presence of indigenous art and ideals in her work and in her home. She and Rivera built an Aztec-style pyramid in their garden, and used its terraced walls to display ancient artefacts. They rid the house of its neo-classical, European elements and painted the walls bright blue, using a traditional Mexican pigment. The original garden emulated the 19th-century European taste for ferns and palms. To these Kahlo added native plants such as agave, cactus and prickly pear, which grew alongside orange and apricot trees, quince and pomegranate. Many of these plants found their way on to her body – she almost always wore flowers threaded through her hair – and into her paintings. The garden of her childhood features in My Grandparents, My Parents, and I (1936), and in her Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) she is surrounded by a wall of vegetation that threatens to overwhelm her. These elephant ear plants can still be seen growing in the Casa Azul today. Her love of flowers, fruits and vegetables is most vividly expressed in her still-life paintings. She liked to use native fruits and flowers as a means of highlighting her Mexican heritage and nationality. “Mexican intellectuals were not just rediscovering native traditions and rituals, they were also discovering the Mexican natural world again, and the plant world particularly,” Adriana Zavala, the exhibition curator and author of the book, says. Kahlo would have been very familiar with the Dutch and Spanish still-life tradition, examples of which would have come over with the conquistadors. A painting of magnolia blooms is one of her most beautiful interpretations of this genre. In all likelihood, she used the magnolia that still grows in her courtyard as her model. But her decision to paint it went much deeper. The flower appealed to her because its unopened buds resemble a heart – one of her lovers, the Spanish artist Josep Bartolí, recalled Kahlo saying, “Fruits are like flowers – they speak to us in provocative language and teach us things that are hidden.” Kahlo was fascinated by symbols and myths, and often her depictions of plants are emblematic. Still Life (for Samuel Fastlicht) (1951), for example (Fastlicht was her dentist – she formed strong attachments to the doctors who attended her), is full of species that produce both male and female flowers on a single plant. These kinds of pairings – men and women, sun and moon, life and death – appear often in her paintings, but their meaning is never quite clear. “Kahlo had a very witty sense of humour,” Zavala says. “So a painting of mangos and cantaloupes can be in dialogue with the still-life tradition, but the way she parts the fruits gives them an almost malevolent or sexual quality. Sometimes they may relate to her sense of her mortality, but I don’t think her works are ever entirely biographical, or ever entirely malevolent or entirely celebratory. There’s always a contradiction or a balancing.” The Mexico City Kahlo grew up in was blessed with beautiful public gardens. Her neighbourhood of Coyoacán was known for its leafy squares and parks. It was also a hot spot for horticulture, particularly a large tree nursery known as the Viveros de Coyoacán. About a mile from her home was a famous sanatorium, where one of Mexico’s leading surgeons, Dr Aureliano Urrutia, turned the grounds into a private garden dedicated to health and history. And later she and Rivera would often visit the so-called “floating gardens” of the Aztecs, south of Mexico City, where tourists and locals rode large, flat-bottomed boats through a series of shallow lakes and canals that ran through the thick vegetation like lace. • Rich people shouldn't perv over Frida Kahlo's exquisite love letters One cannot help but imagine Kahlo painting outside, listening to the sounds of the parakeets and her pet monkeys. But this was not the case. “She wasn’t really a spontaneous, plein-air artist,” Zavala says. “She was incredibly meticulous, starting in an upper corner and slowly working her way down and across with a very fine paintbrush. But I absolutely believe that her garden sustained her. It’s why she transformed it. I think of it as an environment that nurtured her creativity.” “Frida Kahlo’s Garden” (Prestel, £22.50), by Adriana Zavala, is available from the Telegraph Bookshop for £19.99 plus £1.95 p&p What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"Frida Kahlo was a famous artist who loved bright and beautiful things, especially her garden at her blue house in Mexico City. Her garden was filled with many colorful plants, flowers, and trees. This garden was very special to her and it inspired a lot of her paintings. She liked to put the plants and flowers in her artwork to show her love for her Mexican heritage.

What is a good title for this?","response":"\\"Strengthening Investment Climates in Developing Countries: The World Bank’s Strategy for Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction\\" In essence, the World Bank is urging the governments of economically-weaker countries to take significant measures to enhance their investment climates. Their rationale is that a better investment climate could encourage both domestic and foreign businesses to invest more in these countries, leading to economic growth. Better investment climates usually translate to improved infrastructure, stable political conditions, and efficient, transparent processes for starting and running businesses. Such conditions not only attract investments but also catalyze the creation of more jobs, thus helping to alleviate poverty by increasing household incomes. Moreover, higher investments lead to an increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consequently promoting economic growth. Additionally, this refers to improving basic services such as electricity, water, and roads, as well as enhancing the quality of institutions that support commerce, like the legal system enforcing contracts, property rights and commercial regulations. It also includes improving education, skill levels, and health of the employed population, as well as ensuring environmental sustainability. However, this target is not simple to achieve, as it requires considerable systematic changes, proper policy making, strategic planning, implementation techniques, and continuous assessment. It also needs the eradication of corruption, the establishment of a proper judicial system, and the promotion of good governance. The World Bank is playing an instrumental role in this process, providing not just funds but also knowledge resources, technical skills, policy advice, and help in capacity building. They also stress on the importance of private sector participation, international trade, and enterprise development in creating a favourable investment climate. Therefore, addressing investment climates is at the heart of the World Bank's strategy. They see it as central to economic growth and poverty reduction. Their aim is not only to increase investments, but also to make sure that the increase leads to sustainable and inclusive growth that improves the lives of the citizens, especially the poor. In this light, the push for better investment climates is a push for transformation. Hence, while it is a challenge for poor countries, it also presents an opportunity for them to break the poverty cycle and usher in unprecedented economic growth. It underscores that developing countries, with the necessary support and guidance, can create a thriving, conducive investment climate and leverage it for their economic and social advancement."},{"question":"Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table. Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? Question: Which is probably true of the author? Options: A. not enough information B. The author is physically fit C. They author is an accountability coach D. The author is controlling === The correct answer is","response":"A. not enough information It is important to recognize that the diet cycle mentality can be a significant obstacle to achieving long-term weight loss and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It is often rooted in the belief that there is a 'magic cure' or 'one last diet' that will solve all weight-related problems, but, in reality, these are just stories people tell themselves as a way of rationalizing their inability to lose weight and keep it off permanently. To break free from this mentality, it is essential to explore the reasons why these narratives do not hold true and to understand that lasting change and improved health require consistent effort, commitment, and a focus on holistic well-being. This means addressing not only diet but also exercise, stress management, self-care, and emotional health. Instead of relying on quick-fix promises and false beliefs, it can be helpful to cultivate awareness around your eating habits, reflect on your relationship with food, and consider the various factors that influence your choices. This deeper self-inquiry may reveal that addressing the root causes of your weight issues requires more specific strategies tailored to your unique physical and emotional needs. Additionally, working with experts like nutritionists, exercise professionals, and therapists can provide support and guidance on your journey toward a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. Accountability and community can be powerful motivators in helping you stay on track and make lasting changes. Finally, remember that achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. It involves resilience, adaptability, and self-compassion. By acknowledging the inherent flaws of the diet cycle mentality and committing to nurturing healthier habits, you can break free from this exhausting and self-defeating cycle and move toward a life of sustainable well-being."},{"question":"What is the answer?

Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees.

It gets its name from the Vedas, which are liturgical texts containing details of life during this period that have been interpreted to be historical and constitute the primary sources for understanding the period. The Vedas were composed and orally transmitted by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who had migrated into the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent early in this period. The associated Vedic culture was tribal and pastoral until c. 1200 or 1100 BCE, and centred in the Punjab. The commonly accepted period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to the second millennium BCE. After the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which ended c. 1900 BCE, groups of Indo-Aryan peoples migrated into north-western India and started to inhabit the northern Indus Valley. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which--according to the most widespread hypothesis--have originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan. Some writers and archaeologists have opposed the notion of a migration of Indo-Aryans into India. Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton used the term \\"Indo-Aryan Controversy\\" for an oversight of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory, and some of its opponents. These ideas are outside the academic mainstream. Mallory and Adams note that two types of models \\"enjoy significant international currency\\" as to the Indo-European homeland, namely the Anatolian hypothesis, and a migration out of the Eurasian steppes. According to Upinder Singh, \\"The original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and Indo-Aryans is the subject of continuing debate among philologists, linguists, historians, archaeologists and others. The dominant view is that the Indo-Aryans came to the subcontinent as immigrants. Another view, advocated mainly by some Indian scholars, is that they were indigenous to the subcontinent.\\" The knowledge about the Aryans comes mostly from the Rigveda-samhita, i. e. the oldest layer of the Vedas, which was composed c. 1500-1200 BCE. They brought with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \\"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\\", which borrowed \\"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\\" from the Bactria-Margiana Culture. Are there specific dates provided for the beginning of the Vedic period?","response":"Yes, the specific dates provided for the beginning of the Vedic period or Vedic age are around 1500 BCE.

According to a report to be released Thursday by Humane Society of the United States and its international affiliate, more than 40,000 giraffe parts were imported to the United States from 2006 to 2015 to be made into expensive pillows, boots, knife handles, bible covers and other trinkets. The sale of these products is legal, but the organization argues that restrictions are needed. Along with other advocacy groups, it has petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to provide that protection by listing giraffes as an endangered species. They are issuing the report now “to ramp up the pressure and show the public the true nature of the giraffe trade in the U.S., and show the administration that the public loves giraffes and really wants their government to take action to protect this animal,” said Adam Peyman, manager of wildlife programs and operations for the Humane Society International. ||||| On April 19 of this year, five major wildlife protection groups petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to list the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) as an endangered species. As the petition asserted, “the giraffe has suffered a major reduction in population size across its range primarily due to habitat loss, commercial overutilization, and severe poaching, and such decline continues unabated.” If the Fish and Wildlife Service agrees to list the giraffe, a set of legal tools will become available to protect this iconic species. But how would listing in the U.S. help this African mammal, whose population numbers in the wild have dipped below 100,000? Extinction is forever While extinction can be a natural process, the current rate of extinction is anything but. Scientists estimate that at least 99 out of 100 species extinctions in the world today are the result of human action. Although people rarely intend to drive species into oblivion, as with the giraffe, they do so through the destruction of habitat, poaching and legal hunting. As the petition notes, “[g]iraffes once occupied much of the savanna and savanna woodlands of Africa…. [It] has undergone a 36 to 40 percent population decline over the past 30 years.” More than a century ago, scientists began to notice the disappearance of once prominent species around the world. The American passenger pigeon, the Carolina parakeet and the Great Auk – once well-established in North America – disappeared. Other species like the American bison and many kinds of whales had once played central roles in important ecosystems but had been reduced to small remnant populations. The existence of species is important to people for many reasons. Sometimes species provide clues for the development of medicines. Often they play a fundamental role in maintaining the functioning of ecosystems on which people depend. As Aldo Leopold – perhaps America’s most famous naturalist – noted, “If the biota, in the course of aeons, has built something we like but do not understand, then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts? To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.” What would you say to a child who saw a giraffe in a book and asked where giraffes lived? Would you be comfortable saying they’re all gone? Roots of regulation In 1964, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) began tracking the conservation status of species on its “Red List.” Although the IUCN provides information only about the status of species, this is the first step in helping to limit extinction because it allows conservation efforts to be directed where they’re most needed. A few years later in the United States, the federal government began keeping an official list of species in danger of extinction – what we call endangered species – and species likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future – threatened species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA), passed in 1973, goes further than just identifying imperiled species. Under its terms, listed species are protected from actions “authorized, funded or carried out” by the federal government that may jeopardize their continued existence or adversely affect their essential habitat. Species members are also protected from direct harm by any person. Commerce in species protected by the ESA is generally a crime. The purpose of the ESA is the “conservation” of protected species. In practice, that means bringing the species back to the point where it no longer requires the protection of the ESA. The law’s goal is not to preserve tiny populations on the brink of extinction but to recover species populations that are resilient enough to survive the bad luck which is so often part of living on the planet. Listing is the public, administrative process whereby a species can become entitled to protection under the Endangered Species Act. It centers around one question: Is this creature or plant in danger of extinction? At the listing stage, the federal government can consider only scientific evidence in making its decision. Anyone can initiate the listing process via petition. Evidence suggests the ESA works. A recent report in the Endangered Species Bulletin noted that of the 78 species first listed under the federal precursor to the Endangered Species Act in 1967, only four have been officially declared extinct after half a century. Many others, such as the California condor, the grizzly bear and the whooping crane, have seen remarkable recovery progress. Some, including the bald eagle, have even been removed from the list. There are now 1,382 species of animals listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened or endangered; 711 live largely within the borders of the United States. For these species, the federal Endangered Species Act can help preserve habitat, require “consultation” on projects that need federal approval and make most hunting illegal. American listing for an African animal The giraffe, of course, is not native to the United States. How would ESA listing help it? The habitat destruction and overharvesting that threaten the giraffe aren’t happening within U.S. borders. The answer lies in the role the United States plays in buying and selling giraffe parts. According to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service database, over the past decade Americans imported more than 21,000 giraffe bone carvings, more than 3,000 skin pieces and 3,744 hunting trophies. If many people want giraffe parts, the demand can be too high for survival of the species. Heightened demand for giraffe products can encourage people to hunt illegally – for example, taking more giraffes than limits allow or hunting in places where it is not permitted. An international treaty, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (1973), known by its acronym, CITES, also addresses this problem. Countries that are party to the treaty meet periodically to list species that are threatened due to international trade. The treaty has two appendices for listing species: Appendix I results in an almost complete ban on commercial international trade; Appendix II requires all international trade in that species be monitored and subject to permits. The giraffe is not currently listed on either of the CITES appendices, but this does not prevent individual countries – such as the United States – from deciding to limit imports. Around the world, markets for species parts are sometimes driven by traditional uses – things like carving ivory or using certain animal parts in traditional medicines. New uses fuel demand too; think of newly wealthy businessmen in Vietnam consuming rhino horn mixed with water or alcohol to show how rich they are. Sometimes, the two can converge: An increase in consumption of shark fin soup has been tied to a traditional celebration dish being served by more people as China’s middle class grew. Listing on the ESA would require the federal government to limit imports of giraffe parts into the United States and would therefore help curtail global demand. The ESA cannot ensure habitat protection or require other countries to take affirmative conservation action to protect the giraffe. But listing in the U.S. would limit one important threat in which Americans do play a role. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"The giraffe population is rapidly declining, and the sale of products made with giraffe skin and bone is increasing. A report reveals that over 40,000 giraffe parts were imported to the United States between 2006 and 2015 for making various products. While the sale of these products is legal, advocacy groups are petitioning for listing giraffes as an endangered species to provide more protection.

The 1984 movie begins with a scene in the very same room, so we figured it was time for the Ghostbusters to make an encore appearance. Enjoy the video first and then go behind-the-scenes with the photos and report below. Agents Hines, Purnell, Lathan, and Scordelis The New York Public Library approached us about a month ago and asked if we would want to stage an Improv Everywhere mission on their property. The library is facing serious budget cuts, and they thought having us do something awesome there might serve to remind people of how great the NYPL is. We couldn’t say no to the opportunity to do something in their gorgeous, 100 year-old Rose Main Reading Room. It actually wasn’t the first time we staged something on the NYPL grounds. Back in 2002, we held a ridiculous protest claiming to be a group called Writers Against Piracy . That mission was, of course, unauthorized. It was nice to get invited by the library this time around and to have their permission to set up our cameras. When brainstorming ideas for the mission, I immediately thought of Ghostbusters. The NYPL is heavily featured in the beginning of the movie, opening with a crane shot of the lion statue outside and cutting to the reading room. The thought of bringing the Ghostbusters back to the library 25 years later cracked me up. Agent Lathan and his binocular glasses Agent Purnell puts on his fake mustache Showing the ghosts a map of the reading room We met on the steps out front and got organized. Agent Adams came up with a plan to spread our team of six camera people discreetly around the room. Most of our operators used DSLR cameras, which allowed them to blend in perfectly with the constant stream of tourists taking photos of the historic room. I went over all of the blocking and timing with the actors. They then headed inside to a staging area and got into costume. Agent Rodgers was the first ghost to enter. He grabbed a book off of a shelf on the way in and started heading for a seat. He was quickly stopped by a security guard, who had no idea what was going on. Guard: Sir, what are you doing? Rodgers: Um… haunting the library. The guard allowed him to take a seat, and then went over to the information desk to laugh about it with another employee. Rodgers takes his seat. Notice the girl in pink’s reaction (behind the girl in white) The first ghost got some nice reactions from the folks he sat by, but they eventually went back to working when it became clear the ghost was just going to sit and read a book. That is, until ghost number two entered. Agent Walker enters as the second ghost (note the same guard reacting in the background) Ghost working in the middle of the crowd Closeup of the ghost’s computer screen After about five minutes, the final ghost made his entrance. He walked down the aisle and headed over to the dictionary stand. Agent Vernon With three ghosts spread out in the reading room, who you gonna call? Ghostbusters surveying the room Tourists and library patrons take notice (and photos!) of the Ghostbusters The first ghost reads, unaware of the danger he’s in As soon as the Ghostbusters spotted the ghosts, Agent Lathan shouted, “Get ’em!” The ghost leaps to his feet All three ghosts leapt up and immediately started running around and making ghost noises. Agent Hines finds the computer-using ghost While the ghost-phase of the mission was pretty low-key, as soon as the chase started the room came alive. The room full of library patrons and tourists all started laughing, smiling, and frantically getting out their cameras and camera phones. It was cool to see tables full of people taking off their headphones and laughing with each other. Agent Scordelis follows a ghost out the door The whole chase lasted less than a minute, as we didn’t want to be too disruptive to the people trying to get their work done. The Ghostbusters weren’t able to get their hands on the ghosts and ended up following them out of the reading room. After they left, the room broke out in applause. The Ghostbusters chase wasn’t quite over yet. They followed the ghosts down the stairs and out the front door of the building! The chase continues down Fifth Avenue The Ghostbusters rounded the corner onto 42nd Street and disappeared out of view in pursuit of the ghosts. My guess is that they were successful, as the Ghostbusters were spotted later in the day in good spirits posing for a photo with a young fan. Mission Accomplished.

British and Swiss researchers conducted a study showing that advertisements featuring endorsements by celebrities like David Beckham and Scarlett Johansson are not as effective as those by ordinary people. The difference is that regular people prefer to purchase goods that are bought by other regular people. In s sample of 298 university students, researchers presented a magazine advertisement for a digital camera that included an endorsement by an imaginary student saying the camera was \\"hot\\" and his \\"preferred choice.\\" The same advertisement was shown to other students, but with a difference:the camera was endorsed by a famous person in Germany. The researchers also measured how important it was for consumers that the purchased products make a good impression on others. While the students said that both advertisements were beneficial, the one made by the student topped the celebrity one if students aimed to impress others with their purchases. More than half of the students, who admitted to purchasing products that would impress others, said they were influenced by the student advertisement. Only 20% said the celebrity one would affect their buying decision. For those who do not buy to impress, only 5% focused on the student advertisement. Professor Brett Martin from the University of Bath's School of Management, explained that the findings can be used not only in Germany, but in other countries as well. \\"Our re-search questions whether celebrities are the best way to sell products,\\" said Mr. Martin.\\"Celebrities can be effective but we found that many people were more convinced by an endorsement from an ordinary person.

Article: For grown-ups,an afternoon snooze is often easier said than done.But many of us have probably experienced just how simple it can be to catch some sleep in a gently rocking hammock .By examining brain waves in sleeping adults,researchers reported in the June 21issue of Current Biology,a Cell Press publication,that they now have evidence to explain why that is. \\"It is a common belief that rocking causes sleep:we fall asleep in a rocking chair soon and,since ancient times,we cradle our babies to sleep,\\"said Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva.\\"Yet,how this works had remained a mystery.The goal of our study was made up of two parts:to test whether rocking does indeed improve sleep,and to understand how this might work at the brain level.\\" Schwartz,Michel Muhlethaler,and their colleagues Laurence Bayer and Irina Constantinescu asked twelve adult volunteers to nap on a custom-made bed or\\"experimental hammock\\"that could either remain still or rock gently.All participants were good sleepers who didn't typically nap and did not suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day.Each participant took two 45-minute afternoon naps,one with the bed still and one with the bed in motion,while their brain activity was monitored. \\"We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swinging condition,\\"Muhlethaler said.\\"Surprisingly,we also observed a dramatic boosting of certain types of sleep-related brain waves.\\" More specifically,rocking increased the length of stage N2sleep,a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep that normally occupies about half of a good night's sleep.The rocking bed also had a lasting effect on brain activity,increasing slow brain waves and bursts of activity known as sleep spindles . Schwartz and Muhlethaler say the next step is to find out whether rocking can improve longer periods of sleep and to find out whether it may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders,such as insomnia .

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The proposed perturbation hypothesis states that if more water gets into cracks in rocks, it will lead to more or faster erosion of rocks. To evaluate the potential effects of this perturbation, let's consider each step involved in the erosion process and how increased water infiltration might impact them: Step 1: When water freezes, it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space. - If more water gets into cracks, there will be a greater volume of water that will expand upon freezing. This would mean that the force exerted on the walls of the cracks will be greater due to the increased volume of expanding ice. Step 2: As water expands, it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it. - With the increased volume of water in the cracks and, therefore, greater pressure on the rock walls, the likelihood of the rock splitting or breaking apart becomes higher. Step 3: The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack. - As more water occupies and expands within the crack, the walls of the crack will be pushed farther apart, leading to a more significant widening and deepening of the crack. Step 4: Clay expands when wet, like ice does. - If more water is entering the cracks, then more clay particles may be exposed to this water, leading to increased expansion and destabilization of the rock structure. Step 5: This causes the rock to break apart. - With more water infiltrating and expanding within the cracks, combined with expanding clay particles, the rock is more likely to break apart due to increased pressure and instability. Step 6: Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock. - These plants may benefit from the increased availability of water in the cracks, enabling them to grow more quickly and spread their roots further into the rock. Step 7: When they do this, their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks. - The faster growth of plants like mosses and lichens due to increased water availability can lead to more roots penetrating the rock, further contributing to the erosion process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have a significant effect on the rock erosion process. More water getting into the cracks of rocks leads to increased pressure, clay expansion, and plant growth, all of which contribute to faster and more extensive erosion of rocks."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: By. David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor. A report issued by investigators inside the Environmental Protection Agency found rampant abuse in employees' use of the agency's government credit cards, warning that officials were ignoring a long list of safeguards designed to avoid the waste of taxpayer dollars. The EPA's Office of Inspector General found 79,254 in 'prohibited, improper or erroneous' spending in a sample of 152,602 in transactions. And more than 93 per cent of the time the employees used the cards, they 'were not in compliance with EPA policies,' the IG wrote. 'These transactions represented purchases of gym memberships, food [and] hotel space,' according to the report. And many purchases were 'split' among two or more transactions in order to avoid spending more than 3,000 at a time – an amount that should trigger more extensive scrutiny. Some of the 80 transactions the IG chose to audit represented payments to vendors listed in the categories like 'dance hall,' 'child care' or 'theater and music,' the report explains. Cha-ching! Several EPA employees used taxpayer-funded credit cards to buy themselves -- and their families -- gym memberships. EPA employees with government credit cards spent taxpayer dollars on gym memberships, gift cards, and even charity donations. Seven separate cases were identified where EPA employees bought untraceable gift cards with taxpayer funds. 'In one example, 20 American Express gift cards were purchased for 1,588 to provide on-the-spot awards,' the IG reported. 'There was no third-party verification that any awardees received the gift cards.' Congress has given the EPA 8.2 billion to spend this year, which is 50 million more than the Obama White House asked for. Three of the 80 transactions the IG reviewed were for 'gym memberships that required pre-payment for services totaling 2,867.' 'Two of those purchases were for family memberships, and not just the EPA employee,' the report explains.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) . - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp). - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes. - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines. - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south. - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'cebidae'. A:","response":"The 'parent taxon' of 'Cebidae' is the 'Platyrrhini' according to the information given.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Nine people were hurt and one sustained critical injuries when a tornado roared through a camp near Watford City, North Dakota, Monday night, destroying 13 trailers and damaging another two trailers where oil workers had been living. The National Service said Tuesday that the twister packed winds that peaked at 120 mph. The twister touched down Monday night at a camp five miles south of Watford City, about 50 miles southeast of Williston. A 15-year-old girl, who was from out of state and visiting an aunt and uncle, was flown to a Minot hospital. She was in an intensive-care unit with a head injury but expected to survive, McKenzie County Emergency Manager Jerry Samuelson said Tuesday. Eight other people were treated at a Watford City hospital for less serious injuries. The American Red Cross said eight residents spent the night at a shelter at Watford City's Civic Center and that several families were among those displaced. Monday night, crews sifted through mounds of debris, but they are confident there are no missing workers, said Jerry Samuelson, McKenzie County Emergency Management Director. The situation could have been much worse if the tornado hit a few days ago, he said, because many of the trailers had just left the camp that was ransacked by the twister. (MORE: Enormous Wildfire Burns Area the Size of Chicago) Karen Holte, a volunteer at an American Red Cross shelter set up at Watford City's civic center, said the tornado descended on the camp so quickly that nobody had time to take shelter. One of the injured workers, Tony Beyda, was among nine people who were spending the night at the shelter. He suffered a head wound and cuts on his arm. \\"I saw it come at me,\\" Beyda told The Associated Press, referring to whatever it was that hit him. He pulled back the bandage on his forehead to show the stapled wound. \\"It peeled it back pretty good,\\" he said, referring to the skin on his head.

William Bunkel, who works for a trucking company, said he was in Watford City with some co-workers when the tornado warning came. They had just moved their vehicles inside because of large hail when they spotted the funnel cloud. \\"We saw it form, come out of the sky, hit the ground and go back up into the clouds,\\" he said. Bunkel, 38, took photos of the twister and estimated that it remained on the ground for nearly a minute. He said he couldn't see any debris. \\"It was a little bit too far away. We just saw the clouds and the rotation,\\" he said. (WATCH: See What Man Blamed After Driving Into River) Besides large hail and the tornado, the storm also produced heavy rain and high winds, said Adam Jones, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The agency will survey the site Tuesday to follow-up on reports of three funnel clouds on the ground, he said. \\"We heard there were three touchdowns. But we haven't heard if that's three separate tornadoes or the same tornado touching down three different times,\\" Jones said. Preliminary information suggests the winds of the twister peaked at 120 mph, the weather service said. A second brief tornado possibly occurred in the area based on eyewitness accounts, it said. The oil boom has fueled a population boom for the area, bringing in tens of thousands of people looking for work. Many live in hastily-assembled trailer parks or man camps, which contain pre-fabricated structures that can resemble military barracks.

It was unclear how many people were at the camp when the tornado struck. Tornado warnings had been issued earlier in the evening for Dunn and McKenzie counties, possibly giving time for residents of the man camp to evacuate. The McKenzie County Sheriff's Office said between 12 and 15 trailers were destroyed in the storm, which also produced baseball-sized hail. Volunteers helped search through the debris of the camp and a Red Cross shelter was set up to assist those affected, the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Alex Johnson, Scott Kurtz and The Associated Press ||||| WATFORD CITY, N.D. (AP) — A tornado struck a workers camp in North Dakota's oil patch on Monday, injuring nine people — one critically — and destroying at least eight trailers where workers had been living, an emergency management official said. The twister touched down at around 7:50 p.m. at a camp about 5 miles south of Watford City, which is in the west of the state and about 30 miles southeast of Williston, the city at the heart of the state's oil boom. McKenzie County Emergency Management Director Jerry Samuelson said crews sifted through a large amount of debris at the camp, but that he was confident that nobody was missing. He said there were a lot more trailers at the camp just a few days ago, so the situation could have been a lot worse had it happened earlier. \\"Obviously, we're very fortunate there are no deaths, to our knowledge.\\" He said the injured were in their trailers when the tornado struck. Karen Holte, a volunteer at an American Red Cross shelter set up at Watford City's civic center, said the tornado descended on the camp so quickly that nobody had time to take shelter. The critically injured person was taken to Trinity Health hospital in Minot for treatment, Samuelson said. The others who were hurt were treated at McKenzie County Memorial Hospital in Watford City. One of the injured workers, Tony Beyda, was among nine people who were spending the night at the shelter. He suffered a head wound and cuts on his arm. \\"I saw it come at me,\\" Beyda told The Associated Press, referring to whatever it was that hit him. He pulled back the bandage on his forehead to show the stapled wound. \\"It peeled it back pretty good,\\" he said, referring to the skin on his head. Beyda thought his cat was killed when his home was destroyed, but was surprised to learn from Watford City's fire chief, Oscar Knudtson, that the cat and someone else's dog were found alive. William Bunkel, who works for a trucking company, said he was in Watford City with some co-workers when the tornado warning came. They had just moved their vehicles inside because of large hail when they spotted the funnel cloud. \\"We saw it form, come out of the sky, hit the ground and go back up into the clouds,\\" he said. Bunkel, 38, took photos of the twister and estimated that it remained on the ground for nearly a minute. He said he couldn't see any debris. \\"It was a little bit too far away. We just saw the clouds and the rotation,\\" he said. Besides large hail and the tornado, the storm also produced heavy rain and high winds, said Adam Jones, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The agency will survey the site Tuesday to follow-up on reports of three funnel clouds on the ground, he said. \\"We heard there were three touchdowns. But we haven't heard if that's three separate tornadoes or the same tornado touching down three different times,\\" Jones said. The oil boom has fueled a population boom for the area, bringing in tens of thousands of people looking for work. Many live in hastily-assembled trailer parks or man camps, which contain pre-fabricated structures that can resemble military barracks. Some companies rent blocks of hotel rooms for employees to live in, and some workers sleep in their cars or even tents. Housing developments are constantly popping up in big areas of town that didn't exist on maps a couple of years ago.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" Do you have any questions?","response":"Okay, little buddy, I'm going to explain this news in simple words so you understand it better. The FDA, which is like a big group of people who make sure our food and medicines are safe, found out that electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, have some bad things in them that can make people sick. E-cigarettes are like normal cigarettes but work with batteries, and some people think they are a better option than regular cigarettes. But the FDA is worried about them and how people are told about them. They tested e-cigarettes from two big companies and found dangerous stuff inside, like a chemical that's used in something called antifreeze, which can be harmful to humans. They also found cancer-causing things in other e-cigarettes. The FDA doesn't know much about e-cigarettes yet because they haven't had the chance to study them closely, and that's why they want to test more of these products. A doctor named Dr. Jonathan Samet shared his opinion, saying we don't know much about these e-cigarettes and calling them healthy doesn't seem right.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. and the situation: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini.

The mobile game has players match candy combinations of three or more to get points. According to the press release, an average of 18 billion Candy Crush Saga rounds are played around the world every month. ||||| In what’s surely one of the early signs of the end times, Candy Crush is soon to be a live action game show over on CBS. Yes, the mobile game. A TV show. With contestants. And prizes. And some giant, interactive game boards. And candy, apparently. CBS isn’t divulging a lot of specifics at this point about how the game will work, or what teams will win – prizes? cash? – after they crush all the candy. Instead, the network is only saying that teams of two people will compete over the course of an hour, using their wits and physical agility to progress on “enormous, interactive game boards featuring next generation technology.” Whatever that means. A host has not been yet been announced, either. However, for Candy Crush maker King, this is a notable licensing deal for their mobile gaming franchise, whose top titles, Candy Crush Saga and the newer Candy Crush Soda Saga, today still see an average of 18 billion game rounds played per month, and are two of the top 10 grossing mobile games in the U.S. That being said, these games are not quite as popular as they used to be, leading to declining revenues, which is why it makes sense that the now Activision-owned King would be looking for another means of making money from its properties. For example, at the beginning of the year, Candy Crush was ranked in the low 70’s in terms of the top Overall free applications on the Apple App Store. Today, it’s down in 130’s. At the beginning of 2015, it was in the top 30’s, for comparison’s sake. Meanwhile, sequels like Soda Saga and Jelly Saga, haven’t done as well. According to CBS’s announcement, Lionsgate and King will work with the network on the new format for the game show, which will be created and exec produced by Matt Kunitz (“Wipeout,” “Fear Factor.”) CBS Television Distribution will distribute it in the U.S., and Lionsgate will distribute it internationally. “We are huge fans of Candy Crush and, like so many others, we know the ‘rush’ of advancing to the next level of the game,” said Glenn Geller, President, CBS Entertainment, said in a statement. “We’re excited to work with Lionsgate and King to adapt one of the world’s most popular and entertaining game franchises for television and make it available to its massive, passionate fan base who can watch and play along at home.” Kunitz says that Candy Crush lends itself to the kind of “larger-than-life, physical game shows” that he loves to produce, and says he envisions the game having a lot of action and visuals in the game’s “Candy Crush Arena.” While I can’t personally imagine anything less interesting than a large-scale version of Candy Crush, there’s always an audience for live action game shows. In any event, it could give you something to watch until that emoji movie comes out. CBS has not announced the premiere date for the new show. ||||| Have you ever paused a game of Candy Crush, perhaps while passing time on the toilet or the subway, and thought, “This game is fun, but what I really want is an hour-long television program”? CBS certainly hopes so. The network has partnered with Lionsgate Television and Candy Crush developer King to adapt the puzzle game into a live-action game show. Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda, two of the most successful smartphone games in the US, are played by matching objects on a game board — which is to say, while fun to play, the games can be rather dull to watch. You’d think the adaptation would leverage the brand name, but not much else. According to this detail from a press release announcing the series, you’d be wrong. In the series, the game that has become a worldwide phenomenon comes to life as teams of two people use their wits and physical agility to compete on enormous, interactive game boards featuring next generation technology to conquer CANDY CRUSH and be crowned the champions. A host will be announced at a later date. I’m bullish that a talented production team can turn most anything into an okay network television program. But it’s difficult to read these quotes and not be a smidgen skeptical (emphasis my own). Glenn Geller, president, CBS Entertainment: “We are huge fans of Candy Crush and, like so many others, we know the ‘rush’ of advancing to the next level of the game.” Peter Levin, president, Interactive Ventures and Games for Lionsgate, and executive producer on the series: “We have a very entrepreneurial culture at Lionsgate, so we look for awesome worldwide IP like Candy Crush and work together across divisions to bring it to fans on every platform possible. Everyone who has played it knows that Candy Crush is an exciting, visual switcher game with great characters” I am genuinely curious how the television show will capture Candy Crush’s “visual switcher” spirit. There is one hint at how the show just might be fun, and it’s buried in a quote from executive producer Matt Kunitz. “The Candy Crush franchise lends itself perfectly to the kind of larger-than-life, physical game shows that I love to produce.” Kunitz previously had a hand in Wipeout and Fear Factor. If Candy Crush is a large-scale update of Nick Arcade or Legends of the Hidden Temple, basically a video game played in real life by a human, then yes. Yes, this could be a very good idea. |||||Summary:","response":"Candy Crush, the popular mobile game by King, is going to become a TV game show on the CBS channel.

Problem:Passage: Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units being placed below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed.

A household refers to a group of individuals living together in a residential unit irrespective of their relationship, while a family constitutes a group of individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption, residing in the same living space. Given this disparity in definition, it's beneficial to understand how many more households there are than families in a given region or globally, as this information reflects societal structures and trends. Justification The number of households and families varies across countries and regions due to factors like population size, demographics, and cultural norms. It is necessary to collect data from national statistical agencies or global databases such as the World Bank or the United Nations to compare the numbers accurately. Furthermore, it is essential to keep in mind that the figures may be affected by factors such as housing shortages, economic disparities, and changing social dynamics. Steps Step 1: Collect data The first step in calculating the difference between households and families is obtaining reliable data on the number of households and families within various regions, countries, or worldwide. This information can be accessed through sources like national statistical agencies, the World Bank, or the United Nations. Step 2: Compare Data To determine the ratio of households to families, one must compare the available data sets. In some cases, data can be segmented by region, country, or globally to depict the geographical distribution of households versus families. It is important to verify the timeframes of the data to ensure accuracy in the comparisons. Step 3: Analyze Trends By analyzing the trends associated with the number of households and family units, one can identify factors influencing these changes, such as shifting cultural norms, economic conditions, and housing policies. This analysis will help in comprehending the reasons behind the disparity between the two categories. Step 4: Calculate the Difference After collating and analyzing the data, one can calculate the numerical difference by subtracting the total number of families from the total number of households. This calculation will yield the number of non-family households within the specified region or globally. Conclusion Understanding the difference between households and family units can shed light on the intricacies of varied cultures, social dynamics, and economic conditions. However, it is vital to consider the source, timeframe, and quality of available data before drawing conclusions. By comprehending the contributing factors behind the disparity between households and families, policymakers and social scientists can better address the needs of individuals and communities."},{"question":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1. The county seat of Suffolk County, NY lies at the mouth of a river that flows into which body of water? Answer:","response":"The county seat of Suffolk County, NY is Riverhead, which lies at the mouth of the Peconic River. The Peconic River flows into the Peconic Bay, a large body of water located between the North and South Forks of Long Island, New York. Peconic Bay is further divided into two sections: the Great Peconic Bay and the Little Peconic Bay. The Great Peconic Bay is the larger, western section of the bay, and it lies between the western areas of the North Fork (Riverhead, Flanders, and Jamesport) and the South Fork (Westhampton Beach, Quogue, Hampton Bays, and Southampton). The Little Peconic Bay is the smaller, eastern section of Peconic Bay, which sits between the eastern portions of the North Fork (Cutchogue, Southold, and Greenport) and the South Fork (Bridgehampton, Sag Harbor, and East Hampton). The Peconic Bay system is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Shinnecock Canal, which runs between Great Peconic Bay and Shinnecock Bay, and Gardiners Bay, which connects near the eastern end of Little Peconic Bay. These connections allow for the exchange of water between the Peconic system and the surrounding coastal waters of Long Island, enhancing the quality and biodiversity of its marine habitats. In addition to its ecological importance, Peconic Bay contributes to the local economy through its many recreational and commercial activities. The bay is a popular destination for boating, fishing, sailing, and other water-based activities, while its numerous beaches, parks, and nature preserves offer opportunities for further exploration and relaxation. The presence of Riverhead, the county seat of Suffolk County, at the mouth of the Peconic River highlights the significance of this water system within the region and the state.

She loved it,” her father, Tom Smedinghoff, told The Associated Press on Sunday. “She was tailor-made for this job.” Anne Smedinghoff grew up in River Forest, Ill. — an upscale suburb about 10 miles west of Chicago — the daughter of an attorney and the second of four children. She attended the highly selective Fenwick High School, followed by Johns Hopkins University, where she majored in international studies and became a key organizer of the university’s annual Foreign Affairs Symposium in 2008. The event draws high-profile speakers from around the world. Those who knew Smedinghoff described her as a positive, hard-working and dependable young woman. While a student in Baltimore, she worked part time for Sam Hopkins, an attorney near campus. He described her as ambitious “but in a wonderfully quiet, modest way.” Her first assignment for the foreign service was in Caracas, Venezuela, and she volunteered for the Afghanistan assignment after that. Her father said family members would tease her about signing up for a less dangerous location, maybe London or Paris. “She said, ‘What would I do in London or Paris? It would be so boring,’” her father recalled. In her free time, she would travel as much as possible, her father said. Smedinghoff was an up-and-coming employee of the State Department who garnered praise from the highest ranks. She was to finish her Afghanistan assignment as a press officer in July. Already fluent in Spanish, she was gearing up to learn Arabic, first for a year in the U.S. and then in Cairo, before a two-year assignment in Algeria. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday at a news conference in Turkey that Smedinghoff was “vivacious, smart” and “capable.” Smedinghoff had assisted Kerry during a visit to Afghanistan two weeks ago. He also described Smedinghoff as “a selfless, idealistic woman who woke up yesterday morning and set out to bring textbooks to school children, to bring them knowledge.” Her father said they knew the assignments were dangerous, though she spent most of her time at the U.S. Embassy compound. Trips outside were in heavily armored convoys — as was Saturday’s trip that killed five Americans, including Smedinghoff. The U.S. Department of Defense did not release the names of the others who died: three soldiers and one employee. “It’s like a nightmare, you think will go away and it’s not,” he said. “We keep saying to ourselves, we’re just so proud of her, we take consolation in the fact that she was doing what she loved.” Friends remembered her Sunday for her charity work too. Smedinghoff participated in a 2009 cross-country bike ride for The 4K for Cancer — part of the Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults — according to the group. She served on the group’s board of directors after the ride from Baltimore to San Francisco. “She was an incredible young woman. She was always optimistic,” said Ryan Hanley, a founder of the group. “She always had a smile on her face and incredible devotion to serving others.” Johns Hopkins officials mourned her death in a letter on Sunday to students, faculty and alumni. Smedinghoff graduated in 2009. In the letter, University President Ronald J. Daniels praised her work on the symposium, her involvement in her sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, and her involvement outside campus too. “Her selfless action for others was nothing new,” he wrote. Funeral arrangements for Smedinghoff are pending. Contact Sophia Tareen at https://www.twitter.com/sophiatareen Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Only Libya's myriad armed militias really wield power - and it is felt they often hold the politicians they supposedly back to ransom. During the uprising, anyone with a gun could command respect, and lots of armed groups emerged - up to 1,700, according to some estimates. There are two rival parliaments and three governments - the latest government was formed in UN-brokered talks with the aim of replacing the other two. But this initiative is still on the rocks, partly because of concerns that the new government is being imposed by Western powers. The oil-rich country once had one of the highest standards of living in Africa, with free healthcare and free education, but six years on from the uprising, it is facing a financial crisis. This turmoil has allowed IS to gain a foothold in the country. Top IS leaders 'take refuge' in Libya IS had taken control of an \\"enclave\\" in and around the city of Sirte, the birthplace of Gaddafi. Security experts feared this could provide a safe haven for jihadists to train, fund and plan attacks in North Africa and across the Mediterranean. However, pro-government forces backed by the West have now pushed back the Islamists and retaken the city. Some security analysts describe Libya as an arms bazaar. It is awash with weapons looted from Gaddafi's arsenal - making an ideal playground for jihadists fleeing air strikes in Syria and Iraq. IS has been attacking Libyan oil facilities, has kidnapped several foreign oil workers and in 2015 was behind two high-profile attacks on Tunisia's tourism industry - carried out by gunmen trained in Libya. Tunisia has built a partial security barrier and trench along its border with Libya aimed at preventing further atrocities. Beheadings and racial tension: Life under Islamic State How IS's Libya foothold threatens UK The Libyans gaining ground on IS The US has carried out at least four known air strikes in Libya since 2015. The latest one, in January, targeted an alleged training camp on the outskirts of Sirte where some IS militants had fled after the city fell. The UK and France also have special forces operating in the North African state - the nature and extent of these operations have largely been secretive. Three French soldiers died in July 2016 when their helicopter was shot down by militiamen who identified themselves as belonging to a new militant group called Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB). Last year, plans were unveiled to send 6,000 troops from a number of Nato countries, including the UK and France, to Libya to train local troops to stop IS-linked groups from gaining more territory and to provide security to diplomatic missions that were looking to move back to the capital. However, the new unity government was reluctant to openly allow or request such a presence and the plan has still not materialised. Former US President Barack Obama, in an interview published in April 2016, said that the \\"worst mistake\\" of his presidency was the failure to prepare for the aftermath of Col Gaddafi's overthrow. He partly blamed then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron for \\"the mess\\", saying he had not done enough to support the North African nation whose instability was threatening its neighbours and was a factor in Europe's migrant crisis. Parliamentary elections held in 2014 were disputed. Those who held power refused to give it up and remained in the capital, Tripoli. The newly elected parliament then moved to the port of Tobruk, 1,000km (620 miles) away and set up a rival government. This parliament still has the official backing of the UN as Libya's official legislative body - despite the fact that it is opposed to the new unity administration. It wants Gen Khalifa Haftar, who is leading the battle against Islamist militias, to keep a senior role in a future army, something the UN agreement does not guarantee. The UN-mediated deal for a unity government has seen the formation of a nine-member Presidency Council, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj. He arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 to set up his administration and has been trying to win the support of the various militias and politicians, but it has little real power over the whole country. The council has also suffered from divisions. Two members boycotted it continuously, eventually moving to the east, while another member resigned. Mr Sarraj, an engineer by profession, approved the 1 August 2016 US air strike on suspected IS positions in Sirte, in the first co-ordinated military action between his government and the US. Has Libya pulled back from the brink? They were united in their hatred for Gaddafi - but nothing more. There was no single group in charge of the rebellion. Militias were based in different cities, fighting their own battles. They are also ideologically divided - some of them are militant or moderate Islamists, others are secessionists or monarchists and yet others are liberals. Furthermore, the militias are split along regional, ethnic and local lines, making it a combustible mix. And after more than four decades of authoritarian rule, they had little understanding of democracy. So they were unable to forge compromises and build a new state based on the rule of law. My search for Gaddafi's golden gun East and central: West: Guide to Libya's militias Profile: Khalifa Haftar Rogue general divides Libyans Oil production almost ground to a halt for more than two years but has recovered a little in recent months. This happened after a siege was lifted by LNA forces when they took over the main oil fields in central Libya and expelled a rival armed group led by Ibrahim Jathran. Banks are still strapped for cash, however, and there is little foreign currency available officially. The black market exchange rate has sky-rocketed in recent months, and food prices have risen. Hospitals are in short supply of medicine. An estimated 400,000 Libyans are also internally displaced. What was that article about?","response":"The article discusses the complex and unstable situation in Libya, where multiple governments, armed militias, and extremist groups are vying for power. The Western powers, particularly the United States, have been increasingly concerned about the growing presence of the Islamic State (IS) in North Africa.

He's also one of the most wanted men in the United States. Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel, which is battling for turf along the border. For five years, the State Department has kept a 5 million bounty on his head, calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security. Guzman, who leads the Sinaloa cartel, is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border. He recently upped the stakes, ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors, according to the Los Angeles Times. The cartel's tentacles and those of its chief rival, the Gulf cartel, already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March. \\"No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does,\\" said Arabit, who heads the DEA's office in this year's border hot spot, El Paso, Texas. See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. A December 2008 report by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities. So far, the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico, where the cartels' running gunbattles with police, the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year. It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007. Once again, drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year, Arabit said. See who the key players are ». The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker, DEA agents say. But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire. \\"It's coming. I guarantee, it's coming,\\" said Michael Sanders, a DEA spokesman in Washington. Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman's shoot-to-kill instructions aren't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing sources and intelligence memos. The move is seen as dangerously brazen, the newspaper reported. In the past, the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement. U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border. The Obama administration committed to spending an additional 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border. But 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target. Guzman, who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel, is said to be worth 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade. He made this year's Forbes list of the richest of the rich, landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune. Popular Mexican songs, called narcocorridos, embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader. \\"Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico,\\" said security consultant Scott Stewart, invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993. Stewart, a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor, a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman's worth. Just a decade ago, Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians, moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels. The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back. Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits. Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, according to the DEA. Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine. Marijuana became the cartels' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007, bringing in 8.5 billion. Cocaine came in second, at 3.9 billion, and methamphetamine earned 1 billion, a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year. Watch how marijuana became the cartels' top cash crop ». The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels, but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border, according to the DEA agents, local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN. The cartels' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa, Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence. The status and alliances of the players continue to shift. Although the DEA and some analysts disagree, others say the Zetas, a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police, are now running the Gulf cartel. \\"From what we've seen, the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel,\\" analyst Stewart said. \\"In violent times, soldiers tend to rise to the top.\\" These soldiers are incredibly well-armed, police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime \\"Hummer\\" Gonzalez Duran. It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles, including AK-47s; 287 grenades; two rocket launchers; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. At the very least, the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table. The DEA's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate. Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a former military man who is also known as \\"El Lazco,\\" or \\"The Executioner.\\" The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors. The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas; Sonora Nogales, across from Nogales, Arizona; and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California. Two years ago, the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas. It's all about the highways that help move the drugs. Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor, and Juarez has easy access to I-10, a major east-west interstate, and I-25, which runs north to Denver, Colorado. Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5, which heads north all the way to the Canadian border. Some of the battles are internal, Arabit said. Some are with other cartels. And some, he said, can be attributed to the cartels' \\"desperate\\" attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers. As soon as he took office in January 2007, Calderon called out the cartels. He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and, in some cases, do the job of local police. Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office. The violence involves beheadings, running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches. Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight. The cartels' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets. \\"The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq,\\" analyst Stewart said. \\"It was simple machismo. The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas.\\" When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant, beneficiaries of their location. Today, they are shadows of their former selves, weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders. Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997. Known as \\"The King of the Skies\\" for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes, he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest. Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery. Two of them later were killed. His death, along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen, set the stage for the ongoing turf battle. When Cardenas was extradited in 2007, Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez as well as Nogales. Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston, Texas, where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros, Mexico. Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana, and last year, Guzman made a move on that plaza as well. \\"Right now, they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar,\\" said the DEA's Elizabeth Kempshall, who heads the agency's office in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix has become the nation's kidnapping capital, largely because of the cartels' increasing presence. Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition: \\"That is the worst thing for any cartel leader, to face justice in the United States.\\" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this story. Write highlights for this article.","response":"1.

Title: Deadfall Movie plot: Addison (Eric Bana) and Liza (Olivia Wilde) are siblings on the run in Michigan from a casino heist gone wrong. They decide to split up when their driver is fatally injured in a crash and Addison murders a state trooper responding to the crash scene. Their goal is to cross the CanadaâUS border during a blizzard. Meanwhile, former boxer Jay (Charlie Hunnam) is released from prison. He calls his parents June (Sissy Spacek) and retired sheriff Chet (Kris Kristofferson) to say he'll be home for Thanksgiving. He confronts his former coach in Detroit, demanding money owed him. The two get into a fight and Jay, thinking he has killed him, flees, fearing he will be sent back to jail. Hannah (Kate Mara), the sheriff's deputy, visits Jay's parents, who invite her to join them for Thanksgiving dinner. At the police station, she is treated poorly by her father, sheriff Becker (Treat Williams), who does not want to include her in the hunt for the unknown criminals. Hannah, who has been accepted to be trained to become an FBI agent, excuses her father's behavior because of the loss of his wife, even though it was years ago. Jay finds a shivering Liza in the road and offers her a ride to the nearest gas station. Meanwhile, wandering in the snow, Addison encounters an elderly man tending to his damaged snowmobile. He attacks the man, who slices off Addison's little finger before being stabbed to death by his own knife. Addison drives off on the snowmobile, which he later abandons after it breaks down, but not before cauterizing his wound on the still hot engine. Jay and Liza stop at a bar during the blizzard. She sneaks back to his truck, finds Jay's address and leaves Addison a message to meet up there. A romantic relationship develops between Jay and Liza, who have sex in a motel.

Romney, a former governor from neighboring Massachusetts, leads the Republican field with 37 percent support in the poll released late on Friday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center/WMUR. Cain trails with 12 percent, followed by Texas congressman Ron Paul at 9 percent and former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman at 8 percent. \\"Romney is solid here and has the highest favorability ratings, and he's had those for two years,\\" said Andrew Smith, director of the polling group. \\"It's kind of an obstacle course for the front-runner, but as long as they make it through those obstacles they win.\\" In the polling group's last poll in July, Romney had 35 percent support. New Hampshire's primary, traditionally the first in the nation, could be held in early January or even December following moves by other states to bring forward their primaries or caucuses. New Hampshire's mostly moderate Republicans had little love for Tea Party favorites Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann. Texas Governor Perry drew just 4 percent, tied with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Minnesota congresswoman Bachmann lagged at just 2 percent. The poll of 345 likely Republican primary voters was conducted between September 26 and October 6, and had a margin of error of 5.3 percentage points. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has not entered the race, was at 8 percent. Three percent backed former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who said on October 5 that she would not run. A range of data showed Romney's strength in the state, where he owns a vacation home: 65 percent of those polled said they expect Romney to win the Republican nomination, and 52 percent said he was the Republican with the best chance to beat President Barack Obama in the November 2012 general election. Cain is the latest Republican to gain momentum and appear as a potential alternative to Romney. Perry, Bachmann and Gingrich all briefly emerged as potential challengers to Romney in New Hampshire before fading. \\"There have been a number of people who have gotten that bounce over 10 percent but haven't been able to consolidate support,\\" Smith said. Republican candidates will debate in Hanover, New Hampshire, on Tuesday.

Second question: Can we connect microphone directly to speaker? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"First, let us address each question individually before discussing the similarities between the two questions. 1. Can we connect a microphone with a small speaker? Yes, it is possible to connect a microphone with a small speaker, but the process may require some additional hardware and could vary depending on the specific types of devices being used. Generally, the purpose of connecting a microphone to a speaker is to amplify the sound captured by the microphone so that it becomes more audible to a wider audience. Here's a general outline of the process to connect a microphone to a small speaker: a. Select the appropriate microphone and speaker: Ensure that both the microphone and speaker are compatible with each other in terms of connection type (analog or digital), power requirements, and impedance matching. b. Obtain necessary cables and adapters: Depending on the specific connection types of your microphone and speaker, you may require various cables, such as an XLR, TRS, or RCA cable. You might also need adapters if the connection types differ between the devices. c. Use a preamplifier or mixer: In most cases, you will need a preamplifier (preamp) or a mixer to amplify the microphone signal before it reaches the speaker. This device boosts the audio signal from the microphone to a level that can be effectively output by the speaker. d. Connect the devices: First, connect the microphone to the preamplifier or mixer using the appropriate cable. Then, connect the preamplifier or mixer to the speaker using another cable. Make sure all connections are secure. e. Power the devices and test: Turn on all the devices, including the microphone, preamplifier/mixer, and speaker. Test the connected system by speaking into the microphone and checking if the sound is being amplified through the speaker. Adjust the volume and equalization settings as needed. 2. Can we connect a microphone directly to a speaker? In most cases, it is not recommended to connect a microphone directly to a speaker, as it may not produce the desired audio quality and volume. Microphone signals are typically low-level signals, which means that they require amplification before being output through a speaker. If you connect a microphone directly to a speaker without any amplification, the sound would likely be too soft, if audible at all. However, there are some specific situations where this direct connection might be possible. For example, if you have a powered speaker with a built-in preamplifier or mixer, you could connect the microphone directly to the speaker without any additional hardware. In this situation, it is crucial to make sure that the microphone and speaker are compatible and that the speaker has proper amplification capabilities. To sum up, although the two questions may appear similar, they are actually asking about different aspects of connecting a microphone to a speaker. The first question pertains to the general process of connecting a microphone with a small speaker, while the second question is more focused on the feasibility of directly connecting a microphone to a speaker without any additional hardware."},{"question":"Q:Information: - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Mathias Woo Yan Wai ( Chinese : ; born 1968 ) is a cultural worker in the cross-media discipline in Hong Kong , with creative works ranging from theatre and multi-media design , to cultural policy research and analysis , art education , architectural design and screenplay writing .

The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - The Pearl River Delta (PRD), also known as Zhujiang Delta or Zhusanjiao, is the low-lying area surrounding the Pearl River estuary, where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea. It is one of the most densely urbanised regions in the world and is an economic hub of China. This region is often considered an emerging megacity. The PRD is a megalopolis, with future development into a single mega metropolitan area, yet itself is at the southern end of a larger megalopolis running along the southern coast of China, which include metropolises such as Chaoshan, Zhangzhou-Xiamen, Quanzhou-Putian, and Fuzhou. The nine largest cities of PRD had a combined population of 57.15 million at the end of 2013, comprising 53.69% of the provincial population. According to the World Bank Group, the PRD has become the largest urban area in the world in both size and population. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - Stagecraft is the technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it is primarily the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision. - A performance, in the performing arts, generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. Usually the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand. Afterwards audience members often applaud. - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.

Does \\"Stalin's invasions were a severe irritant to Berlin, as the intent to accomplish these was not communicated to the Germans beforehand, and prompted concern that Stalin was seeking to form an anti-German bloc.\\" correctly answer the question of What caused distrust between the German and Soviet governments?","response":"While the statement about Stalin's invasions contributing to distrust between the German and Soviet governments is accurate, it does not fully capture the complexity of the factors that led to the breakdown of trust between these two countries. The distrust between the German and Soviet governments can be attributed to several factors, including ideological differences, conflicting ambitions, and historical events that shaped their relationship. Let's analyze these factors in detail: 1. Ideological Differences: The foremost reason for the distrust between Germany and the Soviet Union was the deep ideological divide between the two countries. Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany was based on the principles of fascist ideology, specifically the belief in a strong centralized state, authoritarian rule, nationalist sentiments, and racial discrimination. On the other hand, Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union was a communist state with a planned economy, proletarian goals, and an internationalist vision. These fundamentally opposed ideologies laid the foundation for suspicion and hostility between the two countries. 2. Conflicting Ambitions: Both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were interested in expanding their influence in Europe and the world. Germany's aggressive expansion policy under Hitler was evident in the annexation of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and other territories. Similarly, Stalin's Soviet Union had its eyes on Eastern Europe and Asia, regions that were already under tension because of Germany's activities. These competing interests created a rivalry between the two powers which fueled their distrust towards one another. 3. Non-Aggression Pact and Secret Protocols: The distrust between Germany and the Soviet Union was further exacerbated by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression treaty signed between the two countries in August 1939. The secret protocols of this pact divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, allowing both powers to conquer and annex territories without interference from one another. However, as the statement suggests, Stalin's invasions of countries like Romania, the Baltic States, and Finland created apprehensions in Berlin about the Soviet Union's real intentions. 4. Stalin's Purges: With Stalin's Great Purge from 1936 to 1938, many Soviet leaders and officers were executed or imprisoned, fueling the sense of paranoia within the Soviet Union. This internal instability raised concerns in Berlin about the reliability and trustworthiness of the Soviet government in any potential dealings. 5. Prior History and Geopolitics: The distrust between the German and Soviet governments can also be traced back to events that occurred before World War II. A significant example is the Russian-German collaboration during the interwar years, such as Soviet support to the Weimar Republic during the period of Rapallo Treaty and German military assistance to Soviet Russia during the modernization of the Red Army. While these efforts aimed at fostering cooperation between the nations, they also amplified suspicions regarding the true motives of both countries. 6. Operation Barbarossa: The climax of the distrust between the German and Soviet governments came with Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The attack marked the ultimate betrayal of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and proved that any existing semblance of trust or cooperation between the two countries was, in fact, an illusion. In conclusion, the distrust between the Nazi German and Soviet governments was a complex and multifaceted issue that emerged from opposing ideologies, conflicting ambitions, strategic considerations, and historical events. While Stalin's unannounced invasions did indeed contribute to the deterioration of relations between Berlin and Moscow, it is essential to look at the broader context to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that led to the mutual distrust between these two nations."},{"question":"Give a quick stream of consciousness before answering the following question. A train 540 meters long is running with a speed of 54 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Options: (A) 40 (B) 48 (C) 45 (D) 50 (E) 25","response":"Alright, let me process the given information. We're given the train's length which is 540 meters, its speed which is 54 kmph, and we need to find the time taken by it to cross the tunnel which is 180 meters long. To solve this, I need to convert the train's speed to meters per second first, and then calculate the relative distance between the train and the tunnel. Finally, I'll use the speed equals distance over time formula to find the answer among the given options. So, first, let's convert the train's speed from kmph to meters per second. We know that 1 km is equal to 1000 meters and 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds. Speed in meters per second = 54 * (1000/3600) = 15 meters per second. Now, let's find the relative distance between the train and the tunnel for them to completely cross each other. Distance = Length of the train + Length of the tunnel = 540 + 180 = 720 meters. Finally, let's find the required time using the formula, time = distance / speed. Time = 720 meters / 15 meters per second = 48 seconds. So, the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel is 48 seconds. The answer is (B) 48."},{"question":"Q:Given the following context: In the year 2023 in a dystopian future, Sentinels have been programmed to identify and hunt down mutants and any humans who dared to help them.

He had been working for less than a year installing home and vehicle alarm systems near Boston, Massachusetts, when abruptly, without giving notice to his boss, he quit his job. He never even returned his tools. He cashed his final pay cheque and left town. Knight did not tell anyone where he was going. “I had no one to tell,” he says. “I didn’t have any friends. I had no interest in my co-workers.” He drove down the east coast of America, eating fast food and staying in cheap motels – “the cheapest I could find”. He travelled for days, alone, until he found himself deep into Florida, sticking mostly to major roads, watching the world go by. Eventually, he turned around and headed north. He listened to the radio. Ronald Reagan was president; the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had just occurred. Driving through Georgia and the Carolinas and Virginia, blessed with invincibility of youth, buzzed by “the pleasure of driving”, he sensed an idea growing into a realisation, then solidifying into resolve. All his life, he had been comfortable being alone. Interacting with others was so often frustrating. Every meeting with another person seemed like a collision. He drove north to Maine, where he had grown up. There aren’t many roads in the centre of the state, and he chose the one that went right by his family’s house. “I think it was just to have one last look around, to say goodbye,” he said. He didn’t stop. The last time he saw his family home was through the windscreen of his car. He kept going, “up and up and up”. Soon he reached the shore of Moosehead Lake, the largest in Maine, and the point where the state begins to get truly remote. “I drove until I was nearly out of gas. I took a small road. Then a small road off that small road. Then a trail off that.” He went as far into the wilderness as his vehicle could take him. Knight parked the car and tossed the keys on the centre console. He had a tent and a backpack but no compass, no map. Without knowing where he was going, with no particular place in mind, he stepped into the trees and walked away. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A forest tree canopy in Rockport, Maine. Photograph: Mauricio Handler/Getty Images/National Geographic Magazines Why would a 20-year-old man abruptly abandon the world? The act had elements of a suicide, except he didn’t kill himself. “To the rest of the world, I ceased to exist,” said Knight. Following his disappearance, Knight’s family must have suffered; they had no idea what had happened to him, and couldn’t completely accept the idea that he might be dead. His final gesture, leaving his keys in the car, was particularly strange. Knight was raised with a keen appreciation of the value of money, and the car was the most expensive item he had ever purchased. Why not hold on to the keys as a safety net? What if he didn’t like camping out? “The car was of no use to me. It had just about zero gas and I was miles and miles from any gas station,” he said. As far as anyone knows, the car is still there, half-swallowed by the forest. Knight said that he didn’t really know why he left. He had given the question plenty of thought but had never arrived at a specific answer. “It’s a mystery,” he declared. There have been hermits – also known as recluses, monks, misanthropes, ascetics, anchorites, swamis – at all times in recorded history, across all cultures. But there are really only three general reasons why people leave the world. Most do so for religious purposes, to forge a closer bond with a higher power. Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha all spent significant time alone before introducing a new religion to the world. In Hindu philosophy, everyone ideally matures into a kind of hermit, and today at least four million people live as wandering holy men in India, surviving off the charity of strangers, having renounced all familial and material attachments. Other hermits opt out of civilisation because of a hatred of what the world has become – too much war, or environmental destruction, or crime, or consumerism. The first great literary work about solitude, the Tao Te Ching, was written in China in the sixth century BC by a hermit named Laozi, who was protesting the corrupt state of society. The Tao Te Ching says that it is only through retreat rather than pursuit, through inaction rather than action, that we acquire wisdom. Christopher Knight: inside the Maine hermit's lair Read more The final category includes those who wish to be alone for reasons of artistic freedom, scientific insight or deeper self-understanding. Henry David Thoreau went to Walden Pond in Massachusetts to journey within, to explore “the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one’s being”. English historian Edward Gibbon said that “solitude was the school for genius”. Knight fit into none of these categories – he did not follow any formal religion; he was not protesting modern society; he produced no artwork or philosophical treatise. He never took a photograph or wrote a sentence; not a single person knew where he was. His back was fully turned to the world. There was no clear reason for what he chose to do. Something he couldn’t quite pinpoint had tugged him away from the world with the persistence of gravity. He was one of the longest‑enduring solitaries in history, and among the most fervent as well. Christopher Knight was a true hermit. “I can’t explain my actions,” he said. “I had no plans when I left, I wasn’t thinking of anything. I just did it.” Knight’s goal was to get lost. Not just lost to the rest of the world but actually lost in the woods by himself. He carried only rudimentary camping supplies, a few articles of clothing and a little food. “I had what I had,” he said, “and nothing more.” It is not easy to get truly lost. Anyone with basic outdoor skills generally knows which way they are heading. The sun burns west across the sky, and from there it is natural to set the other directions. Knight knew that he was heading south. He said that he didn’t make a conscious decision to do so. Instead, he felt pulled in that direction, like a homing pigeon. “There was no depth or substance to the idea. It was at the instinctual level. It’s instinct among animals to return to home territory, and my home ground, where I was born and raised, was that way.” Maine is partitioned into a series of long north-south valleys, the geologic clawmark left by glaciers surging and retreating. Separating the valleys are strings of mountains, now weather-worn and bald-topped like old men. The valley floors at the time of year when Knight arrived were a summer soup of ponds and wetlands and bogs. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A television found at Christopher Knight’s camp. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Getty Images “I kept largely to the ridges,” Knight said, “and sometimes crossed swamps going from one ridge to another.” He worked his way along crumbled slopes and muddy wetlands. “Soon I lost track of where I was. I didn’t care.” He would camp in one spot for a week or so, then head south yet again. “I kept going,” he said. “I was content in the choice I had made.” Content except for one thing: food. Knight was hungry, and he really didn’t know how he would feed himself. His departure from the outside world was a confounding mix of incredible commitment and complete lack of forethought – not all that strange for a 20-year-old. It was as if he went camping for the weekend and then didn’t come home for a quarter of a century. He was an able hunter and angler, but he took neither a gun nor a rod with him. Still, he didn’t want to die, at least not then. Knight’s idea was to forage. The wilds of Maine are monumentally broad, though not generous. There are no fruit trees. Berries sometimes have a weekend-long season. Without hunting or trapping or fishing, a person is going to starve. Knight worked his way south, eating very little, until paved roads appeared. He found a road-killed partridge, but did not possess a stove or a way to easily start a fire, so he ate it raw. Neither a tasty meal nor a hearty one, and a good way to get sick. He passed houses with gardens, but was raised with rigid morals and a great deal of pride. You make do on your own, always. No handouts or government assistance, ever. You know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the dividing line is usually clear. But try not eating for 10 days – nearly everyone’s restraints will be eroded. Hunger is hard to ignore. “It took a while to overcome my scruples,” Knight said, but as soon as his principles began to fall away, he snapped off a few ears of corn from one garden, dug up some potatoes from another, and ate a couple of green vegetables. Once, during his first weeks away, he spent the night in an unoccupied cabin. It was a miserable experience. “The stress of that, the sleepless worry about getting caught, programmed me not to do that again.” Knight never slept indoors after that, not once, no matter how cold or rainy the weather. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Knight’s camp. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Getty Images He continued moving south, picking through gardens, and eventually reached a region with a familiar distribution of trees, along with a diversity of birdcalls and a temperature range he felt accustomed to. It had been colder up north. Knight wasn’t sure precisely where he was, but he knew that it was home ground. It turned out that he was less than 30 miles, as the crow flies, from his childhood home. In the early days, nearly everything Knight learned was through trial and error. He had been gifted with a good head for figuring out workable solutions to complicated problems. All his skills, from the rigging of the tarps that formed his shelter, to how to store drinking water, to walking through the forest without leaving tracks, went through multiple revisions and were never considered perfect. Tinkering with his systems was one of Knight’s hobbies. Over the next few months, Knight tried living in several places in the area – including inside a dank hole in a riverbank – all without satisfaction. Finally, he stumbled upon a region of nasty, boulder-choked woods without so much as a game trail running through it; far too harsh for hikers. He liked it immediately. Then he discovered a cluster of boulders, one with a hidden opening that led to a tiny, wondrous clearing. “I knew at once it was ideal. So I settled in.” Still, he remained hungry. Knight was beginning to realise that is almost impossible to live by yourself all the time. You need help. Hermits across history often ended up in deserts or mountains or woodlands – the sorts of places where it was extremely difficult to find or catch all your own food. To feed themselves, some of the Desert Fathers – third-century Christian Hermits from Egypt – wove reed baskets and sold them. In ancient China, hermits were shamans, herbalists and diviners. Later, a fad for hermits swept 18th-century England. It was believed that hermits radiated kindness and thoughtfulness, so advertisements were placed in newspapers for “ornamental hermits” who were lax in grooming and willing to sleep in caves on the country estates of the aristocracy. The job paid well and hundreds were hired, typically on seven-year contracts. Some of the hermits would even emerge at dinner parties and greet guests. Knight, however, felt that anyone’s willing assistance tainted the whole enterprise. He wished to be unconditionally alone; an uncontacted tribe of one. The cabins around the ponds in central Maine, Knight noted, had minimal security measures. Windows were often left open, even when the owners were away. The woods offered excellent cover, and with few permanent residents, the area would always be empty during the off-season. A summer camp with a big pantry was nearby. The easiest way to become a hunter-gatherer here was obvious. And so Knight decided to steal. To commit a thousand break-ins before getting caught, a world-class streak, requires precision and patience, daring and luck. It also demands a specific understanding of people. “I looked for patterns,” Knight said. “Everyone has patterns.” He perched at the edge of the woods and meticulously observed the habits of the families with cabins along the ponds. He watched their quiet breakfasts and dinner parties, their visitors and vacancies, the cars moving up and down the road. Nothing Knight saw tempted him to return to his former life. His surveillance was clinical, informational, mathematical. He did not learn anyone’s name. All he sought was to understand migration patterns – when people went shopping, when a cabin was unoccupied. After that, he said, everything in his life became a matter of timing. The ideal time to steal was deep in the night, midweek, preferably when it was overcast, best in the rain. A heavy downpour was prime. People stayed out of the woods when it was wet. Still, Knight did not walk on roads or trails, just in case, and he never launched a raid on a Friday or Saturday – days he knew had arrived from the obvious surge in lakeside noise. For a while, he opted to go out when the moon was large, so he could use it as a light source. In later years, when he suspected the police had intensified their search for him, he switched to no moon at all. Knight liked to vary his methods. He didn’t want to develop any patterns of his own, though he did make it a habit to embark on a raid only when freshly shaved or with a neatly groomed beard, and wearing clean clothing, so as to reduce suspicion on the slight chance that he was spotted. There were at least 100 cabins in Knight’s thieving repertoire. The ideal was a fully stocked place, with the family away until the weekend. He knew, in many cases, the precise number of steps required to reach a particular cabin, and once he selected a target, he bounded and weaved through the forest. Sometimes, if he was headed far or needed a load of propane or a replacement mattress it was easier to travel by canoe. Canoes are difficult to hide, and if you steal one, the owner will call the police. It was wiser to borrow, and there was a large selection around the lake, some up on sawhorses and seldom used. Knight was capable of reaching homes anywhere along the largest pond near his hidden campsite. “I’d think nothing of paddling for hours, whatever needed to be done.” If the water was choppy, he would place a few rocks in the front of the boat to keep it stable. Typically, he stayed close to shore, cloaked against the trees, hiding in the silhouette of the land, though on a stormy night he would paddle across the middle, alone in the dark and lashed by the rain. When he arrived at his chosen cabin, he would make sure there were no vehicles in the driveway, no sign of someone inside. Burglary is a dicey business, with a low margin for error. One mistake and the outside world would snatch him back. So he crouched in the dark and waited, sometimes for hours. “I enjoy being in the dark,” he said. He never risked breaking into a home occupied year-round, and he always wore a watch so he could monitor the time. Sometimes, cabins were left unlocked. Those were the easiest to enter, though soon other places became nearly as simple. Knight had keys to them, found during previous break-ins. He stashed each key on its respective property, typically under some nondescript rock. He created several dozen of these stashes and never forgot where one was. He noticed when several cabins left out pens and paper, requesting a shopping list, and others offered him bags of supplies, hanging from a doorknob. But he was fearful of traps, or tricks, or initiating any sort of correspondence, even a grocery list. So he left everything untouched, and people stopped. For the majority of his break-ins, Knight worked the lock on a window or door. He always carried his lock-breaking kit, a gym bag with a collection of screwdrivers and flat bars and files, all of which he had stolen, and could defeat all but the most fortified bolts with the perfect little jiggle of just the right tool. When he had finished stealing, he would often reseal the hasp on the window he had unlatched and exit through the front door, making sure the handle was set, if possible, to lock up behind himself. No need to leave the place vulnerable to thieves. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The bow of a canoe on Lang Pond in Maine’s Northern Forest. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo As the local residents invested in security upgrades, Knight adapted. He knew about alarms from his one paying job, and he used this knowledge to continue stealing – sometimes disabling systems or removing memory cards from surveillance cameras. He evaded dozens of attempts to catch him, by both police officers and private citizens. The crime scenes he left behind were so clean that the authorities offered their begrudging respect. “The level of discipline he showed while he broke into houses,” said one police officer, “is beyond what any of us can remotely imagine – the legwork, the reconnaissance, the talent with locks, his ability to get in and out without being detected.” A burglary report filed by another officer specifically noted the crime’s “unusual neatness”. The hermit, many officers felt, was a master thief. It was as if he were showing off, picking locks yet stealing little, playing a strange sort of game. Knight said the moment he opened a lock and entered a home, he always felt a hot wave of shame. “Every time, I was very conscious that I was doing wrong. I took no pleasure in it, none at all.” Once inside a cabin, he moved purposefully, hitting the kitchen first before making a quick sweep of the house, looking for any useful items, or the batteries he always required. He never turned on a light. He used only a small torch attached to a metal chain he wore around his neck. During a burglary, there wasn’t a moment’s ease. “My adrenaline was spiking, my heart rate was soaring. My blood pressure was high. I was always scared when stealing. Always. I wanted it over as quickly as possible.” When Knight was finished with the inside of the cabin, he would habitually check the gas grill to see if the propane tank was full. If so, and there was an empty spare lying around, he would replace the full one with an empty, making the grill appear untouched. Then he would load everything into a canoe, if he had borrowed one, and paddle to the shore closest to his camp to unload. He would return the canoe to the spot he had taken it from, sprinkle some pine needles on the boat to make it appear unused, then haul his loot up through the dense woods, between the rocks, to his home. Each raid brought Knight enough supplies to last about two weeks, and as he settled once more into his room in the woods – “back in my safe place, success” – he experienced a deep sense of peace. Knight said that he couldn’t accurately describe what it felt like to spend such an immense period of time alone. Silence does not translate into words. “It’s complicated,” he said. “Solitude bestows an increase in something valuable. I can’t dismiss that idea. Solitude increased my perception. But here’s the tricky thing: when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for. There was no need to define myself. I became irrelevant.” The dividing line between himself and the forest, Knight said, seemed to dissolve. His isolation felt more like a communion. “My desires dropped away. I didn’t long for anything. I didn’t even have a name. To put it romantically, I was completely free.” Virtually everyone who has tried to describe deep solitude has said something similar. “I am nothing; I see all,” wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. Lord Byron called it “the feeling infinite”. The American mystic Thomas Merton said that “the true solitary does not seek himself, but loses himself”. For those who do not choose to be alone – like prisoners and hostages – a loss of one’s socially created identity can be terrifying, a plunge into madness. Psychologists call it “ontological insecurity”, losing your grip on who you are. Edward Abbey, in Desert Solitaire, a chronicle of two six‑month stints as a ranger in Utah’s Arches National Monument, said that being solitary for a long time “means risking everything human”. Knight, meanwhile, didn’t even keep a mirror in his camp. He was never once bored. He wasn’t sure, he said, that he even understood the concept of boredom. “I was never lonely,” Knight added. He was attuned to the completeness of his own presence rather than to the absence of others. “If you like solitude,” he said, “you are never alone.” Knight was finally arrested, after 27 years of complete isolation, while stealing food at a lakeside summer camp. He was charged with burglary and theft, and taken to the local jail. His arrest caused an enormous commotion – letters and visitors arrived at the jail, and approximately 500 journalists requested an interview. A documentary film team showed up. A woman proposed marriage. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Knight is escorted into Kennebec County Superior Court to enter pleas for multiple burglaries and thefts. Photograph: Portland Press Herald/Press Herald via Getty Images Everyone wanted to know what the hermit would say. What insights had he gained while he was alone? What advice did he have for the rest of us? People have been approaching hermits with similar requests for thousands of years, eager to consult with someone whose life has been so radically different to their own. Profound truths, or at least those that make sense of the seeming randomness of life, are difficult to find. Thoreau wrote that he had reduced his existence to its basic elements so that he could “live deep and suck out all the marrow of life”. Knight did, eventually permit one journalist to meet him, and over the course of nine one-hour visits in the jail, the hermit shared his life story – about how he was able to survive, and what it felt like to live alone for so long. And once, when he was in an especially introspective mood, Knight seemed willing, despite his typical aversion to dispensing wisdom, to share more of what he gleaned while alone. Was there, the journalist asked him, some grand insight revealed to him in the wild? Knight sat quietly but he eventually arrived at a reply. “Get enough sleep,” he said. He set his jaw in a way that conveyed he wouldn’t be saying any more. This was what he’d learned. It was, without question, the truth. This is an adapted extract of The Stranger in the Woods by Michael Finkel, published by Simon and Schuster • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here ||||| I wanted to read this book as the Maine woods have been a part of my life and I was unfamiliar with this story until I saw this book. I realized from the start that at the core of this story was an important topic I already have been worrying about that I feel American society either is unaware of or is purposefully ignoring: the neuro-atypical person and the challenge of how they will live (not thriving but suffering) in modern America. I found the book a page turner from the start. I did sneak to the Internet as I was dying to know more and found many videos online such as press conferences with the investigating local law enforcement and video of the now-disassembled camp site. The story was written in a way that was engaging and it moved at a pace that was just right. It's a short 201 pages and the personal details were provided in just nine hours of interviewing, limited by the \\"hermit's\\" choice to tell only so much and no more, keeping some things private, and sharing his opinions that are sometimes short and blunt (not pontificating). This is the story of a man who walked into the Maine woods with a small number of items who chose to live in seclusion, robbing lakeside summer camps (vacation cabins) for food and basic supplies. With no military or survivalist training other than reading trade books such as the Foxfire series, he devised systems and carved a llife that allowed him to live for 27 years in the brutal Maine woods, sometimes in 20+ below zero winter weather. He only interacted with other people twice, once saying just \\"hi\\" to a hiker and once with hand movements and body language only. Knight was content and found peace in living that life until he was caught with the help of sophisticated surveillance equipment while robbing food from a nonprofit camp for disabled children (including kids on the Autism Spectrum). While telling the story of Christopher Knight's life as a hermit, Finkel weaves in his research on the related topics of voluntary solitude versus loneliness, the brain and what scientific studies have told us about the human need for social connection, the role of hormones, and about various (supposed) disorders that our society has invented and given names to. To a layperson Knight seems to have Asperger's, but that's a diagnosis that now no longer exists, it's been renamed and grouped under the broader umbrella term Autism Spectrum Disorder. From my own reading of the book Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnosis of Gifted Children and Adults by James Webb et al I wonder if Knight's IQ is one that is so high that other neuro-atypical elements also are present. In the book it was said that doctors refused to make a diagnosis of Asperger's because Knight was too high functioning in daily life to qualify for the diagnosis. The heartbreaking part of this story is that the suffering that Knight endured was due to square pegs not fitting in the round holes of modern American society, his relief and contendedness was found living in isolation in nature, but this is not really allowed in America, and when possible it's only available to those who are able to financially support themselves due to an inheritance or some income stream that they are lucky to find that meshes with their talents and abilities. Also explored in the book was how other cultures around the world have places for hermit-types to go and to live supported for their basic need for food and shelter by society (not financially self-sufficient). Prior to the disassembling of the asylums in the United States, perhaps some of the residents were those who were square pegs. If you just want to hear the story of who, what, when, where, why and how, all that is here in a short easy read. I finished it off in under 48 hours reading between living my regular life. I could have finished it in one sitting if I wanted to stay up too late or clear my calendar for a morning. But this book provides more food for thought, for me at least, than just Knight's hermit years story. I hope this book is a catalyst for Americans to think about this issue, with the rising rates of Autism and mental illness, we have more people this decade than ever before who are not fitting in with the mandatory American public school system and who are not fitting in to work jobs as adults enough to support themselves independently let alone the issue of if a person is happy or content. When a person suffers now they are labeled as depressed, if they worry too much, they have anxiety. The rise in the use of psychiatric medications to try to help people who are not fitting in with American society's defined \\"right way to function and be\\" is not always successful in converting a person into being something we call cured. We don't just let people be, anyone found to be atypical is trying to be fixed. If relatives take in a family member with what we call a disability or mental illness, the cost of living can be so high that it's hard to afford it. This societal problem is going to get worse in the upcoming decades. But I digress. This book is a great read that informs and it was written with respect and portrays Knight with dignity. It's not sensationalized for entertainment purposes and it's not patronizing (thank goodness). Rating 5 stars = Love It. This NEEDS TO BE MADE INTO A MOVIE so it can reach a wider audience and that income perhaps can support Knight's ability to live the kind of life he needs to feel inner peace and contentment. |||||Summary:","response":"Christopher Knight, a 20-year-old man, decided to leave society and live alone in the forests of Maine.

Known for his illustrious career on the field, the ex-Manchester United star has become the subject of a legal battle that has captured the nation's attention. The events leading up to this trial began when authorities uncovered certain discrepancies in Cantona's business and financial dealings. As new evidence emerged, it became clear that the case was of a serious nature, prompting the French judiciary to take action and bring Cantona to court. The trial has attracted extensive media coverage both nationally and internationally, as Cantona's fans and sports enthusiasts seek to understand the events that led to their beloved footballer's entanglement in legal complications. Some have expressed shock and disappointment at the allegations circling around the football icon, while others stand firm in their support of Cantona. The prosecution will aim to present a strong case against Cantona, providing evidence that could potentially tarnish the legacy of one of France's most celebrated sportsmen. Meanwhile, Cantona's defense team is expected to contest the accusations with an equally robust argument, in an attempt to ensure that their client's reputation remains as unblemished as possible. As the trial unfolds, the French public is left to grapple with the rather unsettling notion that their former football hero may indeed face significant consequences if found guilty.

In the interview, she did allow for her voice to be recorded.

Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said in a news conference Wednesday night that coaches were informed by Te'o and his parents on Dec. 26 that Te'o had been the victim of what appeared to be a hoax. Someone using a fictitious name \\"apparently ingratiated herself\\" with Te'o, the school said, then conspired with others to lead him to believe she had died of leukemia. Swarbrick said that the relationship took place online and over the phone. Te'o had described staying on the phone with whom he thought was Kekua for hours each night over many months. Tuiasosopo's friend from church told ESPN that Tuiasosopo admitted to having his female cousin speak to Te'o over the phone. Te'o told Notre Dame officials that he received a phone call Dec. 6, while in attendance at an ESPN awards show in Orlando, from a number he recognized as having been that he associated with Kekua. The woman on the line during that phone call told Te'o she had to fake her own death in order to elude drug dealers, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports, citing a source close to Te'o's family. The woman then tried to restart her relationship with Te'o. Te'o asked for a photo with a date stamp to verify her identity, the paper reports, but wasn't convinced and later went to his family and school officials to describe the hoax. Meanwhile, on Friday, an adviser to Te'o told ESPN's Jeremy Schaap that the linebacker has been huddling Friday morning with family members and a team of advisers, who are trying to determine the best way for him to address the controversy. The adviser, who's been part of the discussions, also said that all of the advisers are thoroughly convinced that Te'o is telling the truth in saying that he was a victim of a hoax. OTL also interviewed two other people who said they have a cousin who had the same online hoax pulled on them by Tuiasosopo. ||||| Notre Dame's Manti Te'o, the stories said, played this season under a terrible burden. A Mormon linebacker who led his Catholic school's football program back to glory, Te'o was whipsawed between personal tragedies along the way. In the span of six hours in September, as Sports Illustrated told it, Te'o learned first of the death of his grandmother, Annette Santiago, and then of the death of his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua. Kekua, 22 years old, had been in a serious car accident in California, and then had been diagnosed with leukemia. SI's Pete Thamel described how Te'o would phone her in her hospital room and stay on the line with her as he slept through the night. \\"Her relatives told him that at her lowest points, as she fought to emerge from a coma, her breathing rate would increase at the sound of his voice,\\" Thamel wrote. Upon receiving the news of the two deaths, Te'o went out and led the Fighting Irish to a 20-3 upset of Michigan State, racking up 12 tackles. It was heartbreaking and inspirational. Te'o would appear on ESPN's College GameDay to talk about the letters Kekua had written him during her illness. He would send a heartfelt letter to the parents of a sick child, discussing his experience with disease and grief. The South Bend Tribune wrote an article describing the young couple's fairytale meeting—she, a Stanford student; he, a Notre Dame star—after a football game outside Palo Alto. Did you enjoy the uplifiting story, the tale of a man who responded to adversity by becoming one of the top players of the game? If so, stop reading. Manti Te'o did lose his grandmother this past fall. Annette Santiago died on Sept. 11, 2012, at the age of 72, according to Social Security Administration records in Nexis. But there is no SSA record there of the death of Lennay Marie Kekua, that day or any other. Her passing, recounted so many times in the national media, produces no obituary or funeral announcement in Nexis, and no mention in the Stanford student newspaper. Advertisement Nor is there any report of a severe auto accident involving a Lennay Kekua. Background checks turn up nothing. The Stanford registrar's office has no record that a Lennay Kekua ever enrolled. There is no record of her birth in the news. Outside of a few Twitter and Instagram accounts, there's no online evidence that Lennay Kekua ever existed. The photographs identified as Kekua—in online tributes and on TV news reports—are pictures from the social-media accounts of a 22-year-old California woman who is not named Lennay Kekua. She is not a Stanford graduate; she has not been in a severe car accident; and she does not have leukemia. And she has never met Manti Te'o. * * * Here is what we know about Manti Te'o: He is an exceptional football player. He's a projected first-round NFL pick. He finished second in the Heisman voting, and he won a haul of other trophies: the Walter Camp, the Chuck Bednarik, the Butkus, the Bronko Nagurski. In each of his three seasons as a full-time starter, he racked up at least 100 tackles. Advertisement We also know that Te'o is a devout Mormon. When asked why he picked Notre Dame over Southern California, the school he had supported while growing up in Hawaii, he said he prayed on it. \\"Faith,\\" he told ESPN, \\"is believing in something that you most likely can't see, but you believe to be true. You feel in your heart, and in your soul, that it's true, but you still take that leap.\\" We know, further, that Te'o adores his family. Te'o's father said that Manti had revered his grandfather, who died in January 2012, since the day he was born. He ran his sister's post-graduation luau. And he loved his late maternal grandmother, Annette Santiago. (Here's her obituary.) But that's where the definite ends. From here, the rest of Te'o's public story begins to grade into fantasy, in the tradition of so much of Notre Dame's mythmaking and with the help of a compliant press. Advertisement Assembling a timeline of the Kekua-Te'o relationship is difficult. As Te'o's celebrity swelled, so did the pile of inspirational stories about his triumph over loss. Each ensuing story seemed to add yet another wrinkle to the narrative, and details ran athwart one another. Here is the general shape of things, based on occasionally contradictory media accounts: Nov. 28, 2009: Te'o and Kekua meet after Stanford's 45-38 victory over Notre Dame in Palo Alto, according to the South Bend Tribune: \\"Their stares got pleasantly tangled, then Manti Te'o extended his hand to the stranger with a warm smile and soulful eyes.\\" Kekua, a Stanford student, swaps phone numbers with Te'o. 2010-2011: Te'o and Kekua are friends. \\"She was gifted in music, multi-lingual, had dreams grounded in reality and the talent to catch up to them\\" (South Bend Tribune). \\"They started out as just friends,\\" Te'o's father, Brian, told the Tribune in October 2012. \\"Every once in a while, she would travel to Hawaii, and that happened to be the time Manti was home, so he would meet with her there.\\" Advertisement Early 2012: Te'o and Kekua become a couple. They talk on the phone nightly, according to ESPN. Some time in 2012: Kekua has a car accident somewhere in California that leaves her \\"on the brink of death\\" (Sports Illustrated). But when? Eight months before she died of cancer, in September, reports ESPN. \\"About the time Kekua and Manti became a couple,\\" reports the South Bend Tribune. April 28, reports SI. Advertisement June 2012: As Kekua recovers from her injuries, doctors discover she has leukemia. She has a bone-marrow transplant. (\\"That was just in June,\\" Brian Te'o told the South Bend Tribune in October of 2012. \\"I remember Manti telling me later she was going to have a bone marrow transplant and, sure enough, that's exactly what happened. From all I knew, she was doing really, really well.\\") Summer 2012: Her condition improves. Kekua \\"eventually\\" graduates from Stanford, according to the South Bend Tribune. (A New York Times story, published Oct. 13, identifies her as a \\"Stanford alumnus.\\") She soon takes a turn for the worse. At some point, she enters treatment, apparently at St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, Calif. (In a letter obtained by Fox Sports published Oct. 25, Te'o writes to the parents of a girl dying of cancer: \\"My girlfriend, when she was at St. Jude's in LA, she had a little friend.\\") Te'o talks to Lennay nightly, \\"going to sleep while on the phone with her,\\" according to Sports Illustrated. \\"When he woke up in the morning his phone would show an eight-hour call, and he would hear Lennay breathing on the other end of the line.\\" Advertisement Sept. 10, 2012: Kekua is released from the hospital; Manti's father, Brian, congratulates her \\"via telephone\\" (South Bend Tribune). Sept. 11-12, 2012: Te'o's grandmother dies in Hawaii. Later, Kekua dies in California. Or is it the other way around? \\"Te'o's girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, died Sept. 11 of complications from leukemia. His grandma, Annette Santiago, died after a long illness less than 24 hours later,\\" according to the Sept. 22 South Bend Tribune. No, Annette dies first, according to the Oct. 12 South Bend Tribune. In fact, Lennay lives long enough to express condolences over the death of Annette: Less than 48 hours later [after Lennay's release from the hospital], at 4 a.m. Hawaii time, Kekua sent a text to Brian and Ottilia, expressing her condolences over the passing of Ottilia's mom, Annette Santiago, just hours before. Brian awakened three hours later, saw the text, and sent one back. There was no response. A couple of hours later, Manti called his parents, his heart in pieces. Lennay Kekua had died. Or does Kekua die three days later (New York Post)? Four days (ESPN, CBS)? In any case, according to Te'o's interview with Gene Wojciechowski in a segment aired during the Oct. 6 episode of College GameDay, Lennay's last words to Te'o were \\"I love you.\\" Advertisement Sept. 12, 2012 (morning): Te'o is informed of his grandmother's passing (Sports Illustrated). Sept. 12, 2012 (afternoon): Te'o is informed of Kekua's passing by her older brother, Koa (Sports Illustrated). Sept. 15, 2012: Te'o records 12 tackles in leading the Irish to an upset win over Michigan State. Advertisement Sept. 22, 2012: Kekua's funeral takes place in Carson, Calif. (The Associated Press puts it in \\"Carson City, Calif.,\\" which does not exist.) Te'o skips the funeral, saying Kekua had insisted that he not miss a game (Los Angeles Times). Her casket is closed at 9 a.m. Pacific time, according to Te'o. That night, Notre Dame beats Michigan, 13-6, to go to 4-0, the school's best start in a decade. Te'o intercepts two passes. After the game, he says of Lennay: \\"All she wanted was some white roses. So I sent her roses and sent her two picks along with that.\\" Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly awards the game ball to Lennay Kekua, handing it to Te'o to \\"take back to Hawaii.\\" * * * It was around this time that Te'o's Heisman campaign began in earnest, aided in part by the South Bend Tribune. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated's Oct. 1 issue, above the headline, \\"The Full Manti.\\" Advertisement And it was around this time that Manti and his father began filling in details about the linebacker's relationship with Lennay. Brian Te'o told multiple reporters that the family had never met Kekua; the Te'os were supposed to spend time with her when they visited South Bend, Ind., for Notre Dame's Senior Day on Nov. 17. The elder Te'o told the South Bend Tribune in October, \\"[W]e came to the realization that she could be our daughter-in-law. Sadly, it won't happen now.\\" Lennay Kekua's death resonated across the college football landscape—especially at Notre Dame, where the community immediately embraced her as a fallen sister. Charity funds were started, and donations poured into foundations dedicated to leukemia research. More than 3,000 has been pledged in one IndieGogo campaign raising money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Te'o's story moved beyond the world of sports. On the day of the BCS championship game between Notre Dame and Alabama, CBS This Morning ran a three-minute story that featured a direct quote from Lennay Kekua: Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honor me through the way you play. Advertisement CBS also displayed this photo of Kekua several times throughout the piece: This week, we got in touch with a woman living in Torrance, Calif. We'll call her Reba, to protect her identity. She was initially confused, then horrified to find that she had become the face of a dead woman. \\"That picture,\\" she told us over the phone, \\"is a picture of me from my Facebook account.\\" Advertisement * * * Manti Te'o and Lennay Kekua did not meet at Stanford in 2009. The real beginning of their relationship apparently occurred on Twitter, as an encounter between @MTeo_5 and @lovalovaloveYOU, on Oct. 10, 2011. Here's the moment they first made contact. Advertisement Lennay Kekua's Twitter name was @lovalovaloveYOU from 2011 until April 2012, @LennayKay from April until September 2012, and has been @LoveMSMK ever since. Their interactions, by and large, consisted of mild flirting. By January 2012, they were a \\"couple,\\" and Te'o sprinkled #LMK (for Lennay Marie Kekua) throughout his Twitter timeline in 2012. As for what Kekua was tweeting, we have only bits and pieces. Her Twitter was private during most of this time, though various Google caches reveal her ever-changing series of avatars and a handful of Twitpics. All of those photographs—with one important exception—came from the private Facebook and Instagram accounts of Reba, whom we found after an exhaustive related-images search of each of Lennay's images (most of which had been modified in some way to prevent reverse image searching). We sent her a number of photographs that had appeared on Lennay's Twitter account, which is now private but apparently still active (see this retweet, for instance). One picture in particular brought Reba to a start. It had been used briefly as @LoveMSMK's Twitter avatar and later in the background of the page (we've blurred out the face, at Reba's request): Advertisement That photo hadn't appeared on the internet—at least, not to Reba's knowledge. She had taken it in December 2012 and sent it directly to an old high school acquaintance. The two hadn't talked since graduation, but the classmate, whom Reba remembered fondly, contacted her on Facebook with a somewhat convoluted request: His cousin had been in a serious car accident, and he had seen her photos before and thought she was pretty. Would she be so kind as to take a picture of herself holding up a sign reading \\"MSMK,\\" to put in a slideshow to support the cousin's recovery? (He didn't explain what MSMK meant, and Reba still doesn't know.) Baffled but trusting, Reba made the sign and sent along the photo. And now here it was on a dead girl's Twitter profile. After googling Lennay Kekua's name, Reba began to piece things together. She called up the classmate. He expressed alarm, Reba told us later, and \\"immediately began acting weird.\\" \\"Don't worry about it,\\" he told her. Moments after the phone call, Reba's picture was removed from the @LoveMSMK Twitter profile. Then, in a series of lengthy phone calls, Reba told us everything she knew about the classmate, a star high school quarterback turned religious musician named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo. Advertisement * * * Ronaiah Tuiasosopo comes from a big football family. His father, Titus, played for USC in the late '80s and early '90s. One uncle, Navy, played for the L.A. Rams; another uncle, Mike, coaches the defensive line at Colorado. A cousin from an older generation, Manu, went to Seattle in the first round in 1979; another cousin, Marques, went to Oakland in the second round in 2001. A cousin from a different side of the family, Fred Matua, earned All-America honors at guard for USC and played on several NFL teams, before dying this past August of a heart-related issue. (He was 28.) Advertisement Ronaiah Tuiasosopo Tuiasosopo, now 22, had once been something of a football prospect himself. In 2005, the Los Angeles Daily News wrote that the young Tuiasosopo, then the sophomore starting quarterback for Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, Calif., \\"looked like a star\\" in practice, despite some in-game growing pains. His coach said he was a \\"great kid\\" who did a fine job leading the older seniors. He was an honorable mention for the all-league team. But then he transferred out of town, to Franklin High in Stockton, where he spent his junior year living with an aunt and handing the ball off. His team featured two 1,000-yard rushers, and he completed only five passes all season. He transferred again: His senior year, he turned up at Paraclete High in Lancaster. Titus, his father, had become an assistant coach there. That's where he encountered Reba. His team lost in the semifinals. A season recap article suggested that he might sign with Hawaii, but that evidently went nowhere. Once high school ended, in 2008, Tuiasosopo threw himself into his father's church. Titus is the pastor at the Oasis Christian Church of the Antelope Valley, and Ronaiah leads the church's band. He also has his own little YouTube music career. He sings secular songs, with a cousin (Conan Amituanai, a former Arizona lineman whom the Vikings once signed), and religious songs, both solo and as part of an ensemble. \\"Ignite,\\" the lead single on the group's ReverbNation page, is a likable enough song. It borrows its chorus from Katy Perry's catchy \\"Firework.\\" But the song only has 10 Facebook likes, a fairly low figure that seems especially low once one considers who plugged Tuiasosopo's single on Twitter in December 2011: Manti Te'o. Advertisement Te'o and Tuiasosopo definitely know each other. In May 2012, Te'o was retweeting Tuiasosopo, who had mentioned going to Hawaii. Wrote Te'o, \\"sole\\"—\\"bro,\\" in Samoan—\\"u gotta come down.\\" In June, Te'o wished Tuiasosopo a happy birthday. How they know each other isn't clear. We spoke to a woman we'll call Frieda, who had suggested on Twitter back in December that there was something fishy about Lennay Kekua. She was Facebook friends with Titus Tuiasosopo, so we asked her if she knew anything about Ronaiah. \\"Manti and Ronaiah are family,\\" she said, \\"or at least family friends.\\" She told us that the Tuiasosopos had been on-field guests (of Te'o or someone else, she didn't know) for the Nov. 24 Notre Dame-USC game in Los Angeles. USC was unable to confirm this, but a tweet from Tuiasosopo's since-deleted account suggests he and Te'o did see each other on that West Coast trip. \\"Great night with my bro @MTeo_5! #Heisman #574L,\\" Ronaiah tweeted on Nov. 23, the night before the game. And there was something else: Tuiasosopo had been in a car accident a month before Lennay's supposed accident. Advertisement Was this Lennay Kekua? We spoke with friends and relatives of Ronaiah Tuiasosopo who asserted that Ronaiah was the man behind Lennay. He created Lennay in 2008, one source said, and Te'o wasn't the first person to have an online \\"relationship\\" with her. One mark—who had been \\"introduced\\" to Lennay by Tuiasosopo—lasted about a month before family members grew suspicious that Lennay could never be found on the telephone, and that wherever one expected Lennay to be, Ronaiah was there instead. Two sources discounted Ronaiah's stunt as a prank that only metastasized because of Te'o's rise to national celebrity this past season. The hoax began crumbling around the edges late last year. On Nov. 4, 2012, an \\"U'ilani Rae Kekua,\\" supposedly Lennay's sister, popped up on Twitter under the name @uilanirae. Manti Te'o immediately tweeted out the following: Advertisement Te'o also wished U'ilani a happy Thanksgiving on Nov. 22. Numerous Notre Dame fans sent U'ilani messages of condolence, and she responded with thanks. On Nov. 10, U'ilani tweeted the following: Advertisement A few weeks later, the @uilanirae account was deleted. The deletion came immediately after tweets from two now-suspended Twitter accounts had alleged that U'ilani was a fraud, that the same person behind Lennay was operating the U'ilani account, and that the images of \\"U'ilani\\" were really of a woman named Donna Tei. Tei's Twitter account is @FreDonna51zhun; Fred Matua wore No. 51, and Tei's profile is full of pictures of herself with the late football star (and cousin of Tuiasosopo's). We showed U'ilani's Twitter avatar to one of Tei's friends, and he confirmed it was her. In yet another now-deleted tweet, Tei herself reached out to Nev Schulman, star of the 2010 film Catfish and executive producer of the MTV program of the same title. Schulman's movie and show are about romantic deception through fake online personas. Advertisement Manti Te'o, meanwhile, has deleted his tweets mentioning U'ilani. * * * Advertisement There was no Lennay Kekua. Lennay Kekua did not meet Manti Te'o after the Stanford game in 2009. Lennay Kekua did not attend Stanford. Lennay Kekua never visited Manti Te'o in Hawaii. Lennay Kekua was not in a car accident. Lennay Kekua did not talk to Manti Te'o every night on the telephone. She was not diagnosed with cancer, did not spend time in the hospital, did not engage in a lengthy battle with leukemia. She never had a bone marrow transplant. She was not released from the hospital on Sept. 10, nor did Brian Te'o congratulate her for this over the telephone. She did not insist that Manti Te'o play in the Michigan State or Michigan games, and did not request he send white flowers to her funeral. Her favorite color was not white. Her brother, Koa, did not inform Manti Te'o that she was dead. Koa did not exist. Her funeral did not take place in Carson, Calif., and her casket was not closed at 9 a.m. exactly. She was not laid to rest. Lennay Kekua's last words to Manti Te'o were not \\"I love you.\\" A friend of Ronaiah Tuiasosopo told us he was \\"80 percent sure\\" that Manti Te'o was \\"in on it,\\" and that the two perpetrated Lennay Kekua's death with publicity in mind. According to the friend, there were numerous photos of Ronaiah Tuiasosopo and Te'o together on Tuiasosopo's now-deleted Instagram account. Advertisement The sheer quantity of falsehoods about Manti's relationship with Lennay makes that friend, and another relative of Ronaiah's, believe Te'o had to know the truth. Mostly, though, the friend simply couldn't believe that Te'o would be stupid enough—or Ronaiah Tuiasosopo clever enough—to sustain the relationship for nearly a year. Since Notre Dame was blown out in the BCS national championship game, Te'o has kept a low profile. He has tweeted sparingly, and he declined an invitation to the Senior Bowl. His father made news recently when he announced on the \\"Manti Te'o 'Official' Fan Club\\" Facebook page that he had \\"black listed\\" the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, which had carried a photo on its front page of Manti getting bowled over by Alabama's Eddie Lacy in the title game. Te'o hasn't tweeted at Lennay since Nov. 6, when he wrote: Advertisement As of this writing, Te'o's Twitter profile carries a quotation from Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo, the great adventure novel about a man in disguise. Life is a storm.. You will bask in the sunlight one moment, be shattered on the rocks the next. What makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes. We called a cellphone for Manti Te'o, but the number we had is not accepting calls. Brian Te'o, Manti's father, was in a meeting when we called, according to a text message he sent in response. Ronaiah Tuiasosopo did not answer his phone or respond to multiple text messages. We left a message with Notre Dame earlier this afternoon. We'll update with comments when and if we get any. Advertisement Update (5:17 p.m.): Notre Dame responds: On Dec. 26, Notre Dame coaches were informed by Manti Te'o and his parents that Manti had been the victim of what appears to be a hoax in which someone using the fictitious name Lennay Kekua apparently ingratiated herself with Manti and then conspired with others to lead him to believe she had tragically died of leukemia. The University immediately initiated an investigation to assist Manti and his family in discovering the motive for and nature of this hoax. While the proper authorities will continue to investigate this troubling matter, this appears to be, at a minimum, a sad and very cruel deception to entertain its perpetrators. Dennis Brown University Spokesman | Assistant Vice President Update (6:10 p.m.): Manti Te'o's statement: This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about, but over an extended period of time, I developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online. We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her. To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating. It further pains me that the grief I felt and the sympathies expressed to me at the time of my grandmother's death in September were in any way deepened by what I believed to be another significant loss in my life. I am enormously grateful for the support of my family, friends and Notre Dame fans throughout this year. To think that I shared with them my happiness about my relationship and details that I thought to be true about her just makes me sick. I hope that people can understand how trying and confusing this whole experience has been. In retrospect, I obviously should have been much more cautious. If anything good comes of this, I hope it is that others will be far more guarded when they engage with people online than I was. Fortunately, I have many wonderful things in my life, and I'm looking forward to putting this painful experience behind me as I focus on preparing for the NFL Draft.

Kekua, who Te'o claimed to have met in person, was said to have died in a tragic car accident followed by a battle with leukemia. The story gained national attention and sympathy for Te'o. However, it was revealed that Lennay Kekua never existed and was a hoax perpetrated by a man named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo. Tuiasosopo impersonated the fictional Kekua online and in phone calls to Te'o. Te'o's friend told ESPN that Ronaiah admitted to the hoax and clarified that Te'o himself was not involved and was a victim. The friend also mentioned that Tuiasosopo admitted this wasn't the first time he had done this to someone. There is still debate over whether Te'o was aware of the hoax or if he was truly a victim. Meanwhile, the Notre Dame athletic director, Jack Swarbrick, stated that Te'o had been the victim of a cruel hoax and expressed support for him during the investigation.

If you purchase a Purebred Cavalier, you can expect them to be energetic, lovable house pets with fairly manageable coats. Genetically speaking, Cavaliers have a happy-go-lucky predisposition. If you purchase a Purebred, you can expect such a temperament. Non-Purebred Cavaliers may adopt some of the biological traits of whatever other breed they are mixed with. If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place. People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues. Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic. Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain.

No Step 1: Identify what the premise tells us. - The premise tells us that being caricatured as The Dumb Guy negatively affected Dan Quayle and did not have the same effect on G.W.
